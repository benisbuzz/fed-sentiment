675,"In the absence of legislation, going appreciably further in the direction of prioritizing price stability, as would be implied by a numerical target that was expected to be achieved most of the time, would be potentially damaging to the democratic balance and would risk a backlash.",0,2,0,0
676,"For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation; increases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote greater actual inflation.",2,2,0,0
677,So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.,2,2,2,2
678,Higher productivity is unambiguously good.,2,2,2,0
679,"As the economy approached full employment, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve System, was faced with the classic problem of managing the mid-cycle slowdown--that is, of setting policy to help guide the economy toward sustainable growth without inflation.",1,2,2,0
680,"To abstract from the potential effects of cyclical factors on the yield curve, consider the pattern of forward rates many years into the future, at which point the effects of current cyclical shocks would be expected to no longer be important.2 Such forward rates reflect not only market expectations of future short-term interest rates but also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.",2,2,2,0
681,"Nonetheless, the members also noted that the rise in compensation increases had been damped and that there continued to be few indications of accelerating price inflation in the statistical and anecdotal information available at this time; such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential.",1,2,0,0

688,"Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months, while market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.",0,2,2,0
689,"Even as the outlook for real activity has weakened, there have been some important developments on the inflation front.",1,2,0,2
690,Participants also generally agreed that the recent data had not led them to significantly change their outlooks for the most likely rates of economic growth and inflation in coming quarters.,2,2,2,2
691,But monetary policy has little ability to affect inflation this year.,2,2,2,2
692,"From a policy perspective, a difficulty with all these measures is that they reflect expectations of headline inflation rather than the core inflation measures usually emphasized in the monetary policy context.",2,2,2,2
693,"Members still saw the economic expansion continuing, and most believed that inflation was likely to stabilize near recent low readings in coming quarters and then gradually rise toward levels they consider more consistent with the Committee's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability.",2,2,0,2
694,"Despite the progress to date and the signs of acceleration in the recovery, employment is still considerably short of where it was when the pandemic disrupted the economy and it is well below where it should be, considering the pre-pandemic trend.",0,2,0,0
695,"Although members generally saw little risk that maintaining very low short-term interest rates could raise inflation expectations or create instability in asset markets, they noted that it was important to remain alert to these risks.",0,0,0,2
696,"But some would argue that monetary policy is actually further away from neutral, based on the fact that current inflation is so much higher than the federal funds rate.",1,2,0,1
697,Many have observed the rise in the real federal funds rate to a level well above its historical average and concluded that monetary policy is currently restrictive.,1,2,1,0
698,"The distortions in the markets I have reviewed do not appear all that large, given the stance of monetary policy, and should we experience much higher interest rates and softer asset prices our resilient markets and flexible economy probably could absorb such a shock.",1,2,0,1

707,What does this suggest about monetary policy strategy going forward?,2,2,2,2
708,"In light of the robust expansion of capital spending thus far this year, the outlook for business investment spending was revised up appreciably, as more of the strength over the latter part of 2004 was attributed to underlying demand and less to the effects of the partial-expensing tax provision.",1,2,2,1

719,"Although the aggregate balance sheet for the household sector was strong and the unemployment rate was low, consumer sentiment had deteriorated, and households were reportedly becoming more cautious in their expenditure decisions in light of uncertainty about the economic outlook and the reduction in purchasing power induced by price rises, particularly increases in the prices of essentials such as food, housing, and transportation.",1,0,0,0
720,"Since June, however, inflation fears have receded, and some financial-market participants have become less optimistic about the economy's near-term growth prospects.",0,2,0,0
721,These arguments imply that slack in labor markets remains considerable and therefore that a reduction in the unemployment rate toward its longer-run normal level would not have much effect on inflation.,0,2,0,0
722,"To measure productivity and standards of living we need measures of output but, to measure output, we need to be able to define products clearly and in terms of units that do not change from one period to the next.",2,2,2,2

726,"In practice, the Fed operates through a committee structure and considers the recommendations of a variety of monetary rules as we make monetary policy decisions.",2,2,2,2
727,"Moreover, when some measures of inflation were close to 1 percent in 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee's official statements specifically noted that any further substantial decline in inflation would be unwelcome, mainly because of the risk that a falling price level (which has not occurred since the Great Depression) could cause a significant disruption to economic activity and employment.",0,0,0,0

732,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,2,2,2,2
733,The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.,2,2,2,2
734,But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant in all transactions over time.,2,0,0,2
735,Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation.,1,1,1,1

737,"Of course, we can’t do anything about long-run employment opportunities, but we can help the economy recover more quickly.",0,2,0,0
738,"However, in light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and product markets and the anticipated stability in long-term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other commodity prices did not rise significantly further.",2,2,0,0
739,Some have been concerned that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury might be working at cross purposes today to the extent that reductions in the Treasury debt supply have lead to declines in longer-term Treasury rates at a time when monetary policy is aiming to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate.,1,0,0,1
740,Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services.,1,1,0,1
741,"Pressures on labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but inflation was projected to pick up gradually in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.",1,0,1,1
742,European equity prices were also lower over the period.,2,2,2,2
743,"We’re not seeing evidence in labor markets of very substantial upward pressures on labor that could signify extreme shortages of labor that could propel inflation higher in a very rapid way, and inflation is still operating below our objective.",0,2,0,0
744,"In considering the effectiveness of the operating regime, the staff observed that over recent years, the Federal Reserve had been able to implement monetary policy in an environment with ample reserves by adjusting administered rates--including the rates on required and excess reserve balances and the offered rate at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility--without needing to actively manage the supply of reserves.",2,2,0,2
745,"However, the projected step-up in real GDP growth over the second half of this year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer news on construction.",0,2,2,2
746,We are not seeing any evidence to date that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost-push pressure on price inflation.,2,2,0,0

751,The increase in upside risks to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign risks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had been for the preceding two years.,2,2,2,1
752,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to the widespread statistical and anecdotal evidence that the surprising strength in economic activity over the closing months of 1996 was persisting in 1997.",1,2,2,1

760,"For example, in his monetary policy testimony of July 1992, Chairman Greenspan said, ""As I have often noted to this committee, the most important contribution the Federal Reserve can make to encouraging the highest sustainable growth the U.S. economy can deliver over time is to provide a backdrop of reasonably stable prices on average for business and household decisionmaking"" (Greenspan, 1992, pp.",1,2,2,1

762,"However, some participants indicated that underlying inflation remained subdued; that longer-term inflation expectations were likely to remain anchored, partly because modest changes in labor costs would constrain inflation trends; and that given the downside risks to economic growth, an early exit could unnecessarily damp the ongoing economic recovery.",0,0,0,0
763,"Nonetheless, participants noted a risk that the drop-back in inflation could be slower or more limited than the Committee would find desirable since resource utilization was currently tight and the pickup in price increases had been broadly based rather than being limited to a few specific sectors that could be linked to energy costs.",1,2,0,0

1139,"The staff continued to project that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, together with a further attenuation of financial stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving household and business confidence, would support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years.",0,2,0,0
1140,The members also agreed that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of greater inflation pressures and that further tightening actions might be necessary to bring about financial conditions that were sufficiently firm to contain upward pressures on labor costs and prices.,1,1,0,1
1141,"In particular, the unemployment rates in the metropolitan areas of South Dakota have consistently been lower than in rural areas, and this relative abundance of job opportunities has tended to encourage migration to areas such as Sioux Falls.",2,2,0,2
1142,"With sales contracting and inventory imbalances still substantial, the manufacturing sector continued its sharp slide, and aggregate employment plunged.",0,2,0,0
1143,"These forecasts and forward guidance had a significant effect on raising market interest rates, even though we did nothing with our primary policy tool, the federal funds rate, in December 2021.",1,2,0,1

1145,"Many would ask what challenges could monetary policymakers possibly face in the U.S., given the remarkable combination of consistent above-trend growth and declining inflation?",2,2,0,2
1146,"Several participants expressed the view that a decision regarding the long-run composition of the portfolio would not need to be made for some time, and a couple of participants highlighted the importance of making such a decision in the context of the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications practices.",2,2,0,2
1147,"Because, under a simple feedback policy, private-sector expectations are likely to be broadly consistent with the central bank's plans, the effectiveness of monetary policy would be enhanced as well.",2,2,0,2
1148,"As far as—as the policy rate, what we’ve said is that we will maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.",2,2,0,0
1149,"At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets.",1,2,0,2
1150,"So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long time from here and the economy performs as we expect—namely, it’s strong and the risks that are out there don’t materialize—my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections.",0,0,0,0
1151,"Rapid responses by businesses to changes in free-market prices have muted much of the tendency for unsold goods to back up, or unmet needs to produce shortages.",2,2,2,1

1153,"Geopolitical uncertainties, notably those relating to developments in Iraq, frequently were cited by business contacts as a major reason for caution, but other factors inhibiting capital expenditures evidently included excess capacity and limited prospects for profits because of increased energy, insurance, pension, and other costs and a concomitant inability to raise selling prices.",1,2,2,2
1154,"In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, we now emphasize that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective.",0,2,0,0
1155,"Subsequent to monetary union, harmonized consumer prices can be used as the best available measure of inflation in the Euro area.",2,2,2,2
1156,"The underlying rate of consumer price inflation in recent months was lower than the staff expected at the time of the November meeting, and the staff forecast anticipated that core PCE prices would rise a bit more slowly in 2011 and 2012 than previously projected.",0,2,0,0
1157,"I’m more concerned about that than about the possibility, which exists, of higher inflation.",2,2,0,0
1158,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that labor market conditions had improved further in late 2015 even as economic growth slowed.",2,2,0,0
1159,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation and wage gains adjusted for productivity.",2,2,0,2
1160,"Very low inflation and deflation pose qualitatively similar economic problems, though the magnitude of the associated costs can be expected to increase sharply as deflationary pressures intensify.",0,2,0,0
1161,Another factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect on the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing in inventory investment.,2,2,0,2
1162,"The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",0,2,2,0
1163,"However, the deficit was up appreciably from its average for the first quarter, with the value of imports increasing substantially more than the value of exports.",1,2,2,1
1164,"By the same token, the effect of the interest rate channel on overall economic activity may be diminished by greater trade integration as changes in domestic demand are offset by induced changes in imports.",2,0,2,2
1165,"In the United States, Congress has set the objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act, as amended in 1977.",2,2,2,2
1166,"Under pure monetary targeting, interest rates would fluctuate with shocks in spending.",2,2,2,2
1167,Theory also teaches that the increase in the rate of return on capital--even if generated by a rise in the growth rate of technical change--ultimately requires an increase in real market interest rates.,1,2,1,1
1168,"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.",0,0,0,0
1169,Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5.,0,2,0,2
1170,"Some members commented, however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain.",2,2,2,2
1171,"According to the Taylor Rule, the federal funds rate should adjust over time to changes in utilization rates (the gap between actual and potential output or between the unemployment rate and NAIRU) and to changes in inflation.",2,2,2,2
1172,"The weakness in labor market conditions remained an important concern to meeting participants, with unemployment expected to remain elevated for some time.",0,2,0,0
1173,Ultimately inflation is determined by the policy actions of the central bank.,2,2,2,2
1174,"But, in the interim, the absence of increasing inflation pressures meant that the Federal Reserve did not need to tighten to bring demand back in line with the potential as soon as it otherwise might have needed to.",0,2,0,0

1177,"Over the long run, real labor compensation tends to track labor productivity.",2,2,2,2
1178,"Nonetheless, given a recovery in U. S. domestic demand approximating their current forecasts, growth in imports likely would exceed that of exports by a wide margin over the forecast horizon.",1,2,0,2
1179,"Going forward, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by further advances in employment and income.",1,2,0,2

1183,Several participants reported feedback from business contacts who were delaying hiring until the economic and regulatory outlook became more certain and who indicated that they expected to meet any near-term increase in the demand for their products without boosting employment; these participants noted the risk that such cautious attitudes toward hiring could slow the pace at which the unemployment rate normalized.,0,2,0,0
1184,"In the emerging market economies (EMEs), a pickup in growth in China in the second quarter, supported by policy stimulus, appeared to be more than offset by slower growth in Latin America.",2,0,0,2
1185,"Moreover, substantial gains in productivity were muting the effects of rising labor compensation on unit costs, and vigorous competition in numerous markets was continuing to make it very difficult or impossible for business firms to raise their prices to cover rising costs or enhance profit margins.",1,2,0,2

1193,But what does this mean for monetary policy?,2,2,2,2

1195,"Indeed, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined in July that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 The recovery that commenced in the summer of 2020 was quite robust, and, with one quarter to go, GDP growth in 2021 is projected by the Fed and many outside forecasters to be the fastest since 1983.",1,2,0,2
1196,Housing activity was generally holding up well across the country as the effects of appreciably reduced mortgage interest rates apparently compensated for the negative effects of declining financial wealth on the demand for housing.,0,2,2,2
