reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every meeti ng.", "And so the C ommittee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if only slightly .", "I think it allows the

, with an SEP calling for additional hikes \u2014I think we \u2019ve moved much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate , and I think that means by\u2014almost by def

being in balance.", "I still think , and my, my colleagues agree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still.", "So we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019 t think we \u2019re there with

seeing a lot of progress over the last year.", "Headline,  of course, inflation has come down materially, but , as you know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going .", "Sufficiently \u2014so I think, you know , what , what we \u2019d like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down.", "And I , I think it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s also\u2014we understand that there are lags, but remember th at it\u2019s, it\u2019s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening.", "I think it \u2019s\u2014I think the reason we \u2019re, we\u2019re comfortable pausing is that we are still\u2014much of the tightening took place over last summer and later into the year.", "So we \u2019re, you know \u2014I think stretching out into a more moderate pace is appropriate to , to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you know, more \u2014with more data over time.", "So it \u2019s a\u2014it\u2019 s a challenging thing in, in economics.", "It\u2019s, it\u2019s sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable lags.", "Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate hikes.", "So if you\u2014if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting off\u2014by the time we had lifted off , the two -year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of where [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points.", "So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where \u2014where news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire.", "But it \u2019s still the case that what you see i s interest -sensitive spending is affected very, very quickly \u2014so housing, and durable goods , and things like that .", "But broader demand , and spending, and, and asset values, and things like that \u2014they just take longer.", "So there \u2019s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it ta kes.", "We\u2019re, we\u2019re looking at what \u2019s happening in the

endpoint.", "I think we \u2019ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really flattening out reliably and then starting to soften.", "And, you know, if we were to see what , what  we would view as significant tightening beyond what would normally be expected because of , of this channel, then, you know, we would factor that into acc ount on, on\u2014in , in making rate decisions.", "And forecasters, including Fed forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to tu rn down and, you know, traditional\u2014 you know, typically  forecasted that it would and been wrong.", "So I think if you\u2014I think if you look at the \u2014at core PC E inflation overall\u2014look at it over the last six months \u2014you\u2019 re just not seeing a lot of progress.",
