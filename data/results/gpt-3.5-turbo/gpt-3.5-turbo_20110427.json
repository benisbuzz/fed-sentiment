["In my opening remarks, I\u2019d like to briefly fi rst review today\u2019s polic y decision.", "I\u2019ll then turn next to the Federal Open Market Committe e\u2019s quarterly economic pr ojections also being released today, and I\u2019ll place today\u2019s policy decision in the context of the Committee\u2019s projections and the Federal Re serve\u2019s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.", "Throughout today\u2019s briefing, my goal will be to reflect the consensus of the Committee,  while taking note of the diversity of views as appropriate.", "In its policy statement rel eased earlier today, the Committee announced, first, that it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its security holdings, and, second, that it will complete its planned pur chases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the current quarter.", "Of course, going forward, the Committee will regularly review the size and composition of it s securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those hol dings as needed to meet the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate.", "The Committee made no change today in the ta rget range of the fede ral funds rate, which remains at 0 to \u00bc percent.", "The Committee c ontinues to anticipate th at economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warra nt exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.", "April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 2 of 26\u00a0\u00a0In conjunction with today\u2019s meeting, FOMC  participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and th e inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer run.", "These pr ojections are conditional on ea ch participant\u2019s individual assessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee\u2019s objectives.", "I call your attention, first, to the Committee\u2019s longer-run projections, which represent participants\u2019 assessments of the rates to whic h economic growth, unemployment, and inflation will converge over time under appropriate monetary  policy and assuming no further shocks to the economy.", "As the table shows, the longer-run projections for output growth have a central tendency of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, the same as in the January survey.", "The longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of  5.2 to 5.6 percent, somewhat narrower than in January.", "These figures may be interpreted as pa rticipants\u2019 current estimates of the economy\u2019s normal, or trend, rate of growth and its nor mal unemployment rate over the longer run, respectively.", "The economy\u2019s longer-term rate  of growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors, such as the rate of growth of the labor force and the speed of technological change, and it should be noted that estimates of thes e rates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision over time.", "The central tendency of the longer-run projecti on for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.", "In contrast to economic growth and unemployment, the l onger-run outlook for inflation is determined almost entirely by monetary policy; consequently, and given that th ese projections are based on the assumption that April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 3 of 26\u00a0\u00a0monetary policy is appropriate, these longer-run projections can be  interpreted as  indicating the inflation rate that Committee partic ipants judge to be most consis tent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate to foster maximum employment and stable  prices.", "At 1.7 to 2.0 percent, the \u201cmandate-consistent\u201d rate of inflation is greater than  zero for a number of reasons.", "Perhaps most important, attempting to maintain inflation at ze ro would increase the ri sk of experiencing an extended bout of deflation, or falling wages and pr ices, which in turn could lead employment to fall below its maximum sustainable level for a prot racted period.", "Hence, a goal of literally zero inflation is not consistent with the Federal Re serve\u2019s dual mandate.", "Indeed, most central banks around the world aim to set inflation above  zero, usually at ab out 2 percent.", "I turn now to the Committee\u2019s economic outlook.", "As indicated in today\u2019s policy statement, the Committee sees the economic reco very as proceeding at a moderate pace.", "Household spending and investment in equipmen t and software continue to expand, supporting the recovery, but nonresidential inve stment is still weak and the hous ing sector is depressed.", "In the labor market, overall conditions continue  to improve gradually.", "For example, the unemployment rate moved down a bit further and payroll employm ent increased in March; new claims for unemployment insurance and indicators  of hiring plans are also consistent with continued improvement.", "Looking ahead, Committee participants expect a moderate recovery to continue through 2011, with some acceleration of growth projecte d for 2012 and 2013.", "Specifically, as the table shows, participants\u2019 projections for output grow th have a central tendency of 3.1 to 3.3 percent for this year, but rise to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2012 and about the same in 2013.", "These projections are a little below those made by the Committee in  January; the markdown of growth in 2011 in particular reflects the somewhat slower-than-antici pated pace of growth in the first quarter.", "April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 4 of 26\u00a0\u00a0The outlook for above-trend growth is associ ated with a projected reduction in the unemployment rate, which is seen as edging down to  8.4 to 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and then declining gradually to 6.8 to 7.2  percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, still well above the central tendency of participants\u2019 l onger-run projections for unemployment of 5.2 to 5.6 percent.", "The projected decline in the unemplo yment rate is relatively slow largely because economic growth is projected to be only modestly  above the trend growth rate of the economy.", "On the inflation front, commodity prices ha ve risen significantly recently, reflecting geopolitical developments and robust global demand, among other factors.", "Increases in commodity prices are in turn boosting overall consumer inflation.", "However, measures of underlying inflation, though having increased mode stly in recent months, remain subdued, and longer-term inflation expectati ons have remained stable.", "Consequently, the Committee expects the effects on inflation of higher commodity pr ices to be transitory; as the increases in commodity prices moderate, inflat ion should decline toward its unde rlying level.", "Specifically, participants\u2019 projections for infl ation have a central tendency of  2.1 to 2.8 percent for this year, noticeably higher than in the Ja nuary projections, before declin ing to 1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and then running at 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2013\u2014both about the same as in January.", "The Committee\u2019s economic projections provi de important contex t for understanding today\u2019s policy action as well as the Committee\u2019 s general policy strategy.", "Monetary policy affects output and inflation with a lag, so current policy actions must be taken with an eye to the likely future course of the economy.", "Thus the Committee\u2019s projections of the economy, not just current conditions alone, must gui de its policy decisions.", "The lags with which monetary policy affects the economy also imply that the Co mmittee must focus on meeting its mandated objectives over the medium term, which can be as  short as a year or two but may be longer, April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 5 of 26\u00a0\u00a0depending on how far the economy is initially  from conditions of maximum employment and price stability.", "To foster maximum employment , the Committee sets policy to try to achieve sufficient economic growth to return the unemployment rate over time to its long-term normal level.", "At 8.8 percent, the current unemployment  rate is elevated relative to that level, and progress toward more normal levels of unemployment seems likely to be slow.", "The subs tantial ongoing slack in the labor market and the relativel y slow pace of improvement rema in important reasons that the Committee continues to maintain a highl y accommodative monetary policy.", "In the medium term, the Committee also seek s to achieve a mandate -consistent inflation rate, which participants\u2019 longer-term  projections for inflation suggest  is 2 percent or a bit less.", "Although the recent surge in commodity prices has le d inflation to pick up somewhat in the near term, the Committee continues to project inflation to return to mandate-consistent levels in the medium term, as I have discussed.", "Consequentl y, the short-term increase in inflation has not prompted the Committee to tighten policy at this juncture.", "Impor tantly, however, the Committee\u2019s outlook for inflation is  predicated on longer-term in flation expectations remaining stable; if households and firms continue to expe ct inflation to return to a mandate-consistent level in the medium term, then increased comm odity prices are unlikel y to induce significant second-round effects, in which inflation takes hold in noncommodity prices and in nominal wages.", "Thus, besides monitoring inflation it self, the Committee will pay close attention to inflation expectations and to possible indications of second-round effects.", "In providing extraordinary monetary policy a ccommodation in the aftermath of the crisis, the Committee has not only reduced its target for th e federal funds rate to a very low level, but has also expanded the Federal Reserve\u2019s balan ce sheet substantially.", "The Committee at this April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 6 of 26\u00a0\u00a0meeting continued its ongoing discussion of  the available tools for removing policy accommodation, at such time as that should become appropriate.", "The Committee remains confident that it has the tools th at it needs to tighten monetary policy when it is determined that economic conditions warrant such a step.", "And in choosing the time to begin policy normalization as well as the pace of that normaliza tion, we will carefully consider both parts of our dual mandate.", "We haven\u2019t seen the GDP number yet.", "But we, like most private-sector forecasters, are e xpecting a relatively weak  number for the first quarter, maybe something a little und er 2 percent.", "Most of the f actors that account for the slower growth in the first quarter appear to us to be tr ansitory.", "They include things like, for example, lower defense spending than was anticipated, wh ich will presumably be made up in a later quarter; weaker exports\u2014and given the growth in the global economy, we expect to see that pick up again; and other factors like w eather and so on.", "Now, there are some factors there that may have a longer-term implication.", "For example, c onstruction, both residential and nonresidential, was very weak in the first quarter, and that ma y have some implications going forward.", "So I would say that, roughly, that most of the sl owdown in the first quarter is viewed by the Committee as being transitory.", "Th at being said, we\u2019ve taken our forecast down just a bit, taking April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 7 of 26\u00a0\u00a0into account factors like\u2014like w eaker construction and possibly ju st a bit less momentum in the economy.", "Well, currently as the statement suggests, we are in a moderate recovery.", "And we\u2019ll also be looking very  closely at the labor market.", "We\u2019ve seen improvement in the labor market in the first quarter relative to the latter part of last year, but we\u2019d like to see continued improve ment\u2014more job creation going forward.", "At the same time, we\u2019re also looking very carefully at in flation, the other part of our mandate.", "As I\u2019ve noted, inflation\u2014headline inflati on\u2014is at least temporarily hi gher, being driven by gasoline prices and some other commodity prices.", "Our expectation is that \u2014that inflation will come down towards a more normal level.", "But we\u2019ll be watc hing that carefully and also watching inflation expectations, which\u2014you know, which are important that they remain well anchored if we\u2019re going to see inflation remain under good control.", "So to answ er your question, I don\u2019t know exactly how long it will be before a tightening process begins.", "It \u2019s going to depend obviously on the outlook and on those criteria which I s uggested.", "The \u201cextended period\u201d language is conditioned on exactly those same points:  \u201cExt ended period\u201d is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expect ations.", "\u201cExtended period\u201d suggests that there would be  a couple of meetings probably before\u2014before April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 8 of 26\u00a0\u00a0action.", "But, unfortunately, the reason we use th is vaguer terminology is that we don\u2019t know with certainty how quickly response will be require d, and, therefore, we will do our best to communicate changes in our view as\u2014but that will depend entirely on how the economy evolves.", "Fi rst, I should start by saying that the Secretary of the Treasury, of course, is the spokesperson for U.S. policy on the dollar and Secretary Geithner had some words yesterday.", "Let me just add to what he said, first, by saying that the Federal Reserve believes that a strong and stable dollar is both in American interest and in the interest of the global economy.", "There ar e many factors that cause the dollar to move up and down over short periods of time.", "But over the medium term, where our policy is aimed, we\u2019re doing two things.", "First, we are trying to maintain lo w and stable inflation by our definition of price stability by maintaining the pur chasing value of the dollar, keeping inflation low.", "That\u2019s obviously good for the dollar.", "The second thing we\u2019re trying to accomplish is to get a stronger recovery and to achieve maximu m employment.", "And, again, a strong economy, growing, with attracting foreign capi tal, is going to be good for the do llar.", "So in our view, if we do what\u2019s needed to pursue our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, that will also generate fundamentals that will help the dollar in the medium term.", "Well, the dollar\u2014th e dollar fluctuates.", "So, for example, during the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008, money flowed in to the Treasury ma rket and drove up the value of the dollar quite substantially, reflecting the fact that U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liqui d in the world.", "And a lot of what you\u2019ve seen over th e last couple of years is just th e unwinding of that as the economy has strengthened and as uncertain ty has\u2014has been reduced.", "But that\u2019s indicativ e, I think, of the\u2014of the high standing that the dollar still re tains in the world.", "Again, ultimately, the best thing we can do to create strong fundamentals for th e dollar in the medium te rm is to, first, keep inflation low, which maintains the buying power of the dollar, and, second, to create a strong economy.", "So, first of all, gasoline prices obviously have risen quite significantly.", "And we, of course, are watching that carefully, that higher gas prices are absolutely creating a great d eal of financial hardship  for a lot of people.", "So it\u2019s obviously a very bad development to see gas prices rise so much.", "Higher gas prices, higher oil prices also make economic developments less favorable.", "On the one hand, obviously, the highe r gas prices add to inflation.", "On the other hand, by draining purchas ing power from households, higher gas prices April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 10 of 26\u00a0\u00a0are also bad for the recovery.", "They cause growth  to decline as well.", "So it\u2019s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.", "Now, our\u2014our in terpretation of the incr ease in gas prices is the economist\u2019s basic mantra of supply and demand.", "On the one hand, we have a rapidly growing global economy.", "Emerging market econo mies are growing very quickly, and their demand for commodities, including oil, is very, very strong.", "Indeed, essentially all of the increase in the demand for oil in the last coupl e of years and the last decade has come from emerging market economies.", "In the United St ates, our demand for oil\u2014our imports have actually been going down over time.", "So the de mand is coming from a growing economy where we\u2019ve seen about a 25 percent increase in emer ging market output in the last\u2014since before the crisis.", "And on the supply side, as everybody knows who watches television, we\u2019ve seen disruptions in the Middle East and North Afri ca, in Libya, and in other places that have constrained supply.", "That supply has not been made up, and that, in turn, has driven gas prices up quite significantly.", "So, again, this is a very adve rse development.", "It accounts in the short run for the increase in our\u2014pretty much almost all of the in crease in our inflation forecast, at least in the very near term.", "There\u2019s not much the Federal Re serve can do about gas prices, per se, at least not without derailing growth entirely, which is ce rtainly not the right way to go.", "We don\u2019t control th e growth rates of emerging market economies.", "What we can do is basically try to keep higher gas prices from passing into other prices and wages throughout the economy and creating a br oader inflation, which would be much more difficult to extinguish.", "Again, our view is that, most likely\u2014of course, we don\u2019t know for sure, but we\u2019ll be watching carefully\u2014our vi ew is that gas prices will not c ontinue to rise at the recent pace, and as they stabilize or even  come down if the situation stab ilizes in the Middle East, that that will provide some relief on the inflation front.", "Last August when we began to talk about another r ound of securities purchases, growth was very moderate.", "And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to bring the unemployment rate down.", "Since then, we have seen a reasonable amount of payroll creation, job creation.", "And that picked up in th e most recent few months, together with the decline in the unemployment rate from, you know,  10 percent down to the current rate of 8.8 percent.", "So the labor market is  improving gradually, as we say in our statement.", "We are still something like 7 million-plus jobs below where we were before the crisis.", "And so, clea rly, the fact that we\u2019re moving in  the right direction, even though that\u2019s encouraging, doesn\u2019t mean that the labor ma rket is in good shape.", "And we\u2019re going to have to, you know, continue to  watch and hope that we will get stronger and increasingly strong job creation going forward.", "Well, again, the inflation expectations that we are concerned about are medium-term inflation expect ations.", "So we\u2019ve seen, for example, in the financial markets, in the indexed bond market, for example, or in surveys like the Michigan survey, we\u2019ve seen near-term inflation expectati ons rise fairly significan tly, which is reasonable given higher commodity prices, higher gas prices.", "But for the most part, although there\u2019s been some movement here and there, for the most pa rt, I think it\u2019s fair to say that medium-term inflation expectations have not re ally moved very much, and they still indicate confidence that the Fed will ensure that inflation in the medi um term will be close to what I\u2019ve called the mandate-consistent level.", "In  the short run, we can  communicate and try to make sure the public understands what our polic y is attempting to do, to be clear what our objectives are and what steps we\u2019re willing to ta ke to meet those objectives.", "Ultimately, if\u2014if inflation persists or if inflati on expectations begin to move, then  there\u2019s no substitute for action.", "I think\u2014w hile it is very, very important for us to try to help the economy create jobs and to s upport the recovery, I thi nk every central banker understands that keeping inflation lo w and stable is absolutely esse ntial to a successful economy.", "Our view is that\u2014based on past experience a nd based on our analysis\u2014is that  the end of the program is unlikely to have significant effects on financ ial markets or on the economy, the reason being that, first\u2014just a simple point that we hoped we have telegraphed today\u2014we hope we have communicated what we\u2019re planning to do.", "And the markets have well anticipated this step.", "And you would expect that policy steps which are well anticipated by the market would have relatively small effects because whatever effects you\u2019re going to have would have already been capitalized in the financial markets.", "Secondly, we  subscribe generally to what we call here the stock view of the effects of securities purch ases, which\u2014by which I mean that what matters primarily for interest rates, stock prices, and so  on is not the pace of ongoing purchase, but rather the size of the portfolio that the Federal Reserv e holds.", "And so, when we complete the program, as you noted, we are going to continue to reinvest  maturing securities, bo th Treasuries and MBS, and so the amount of securities th at we hold will remain approxima tely constant.", "Put another way, the amount of ease, monetary policy easing, should essentially remain constant go ing forward from\u2014from Ju ne.", "At some point, presumably early in our exit process, we will, I suspect, based on conversations we\u2019ve been having around the FOMC table, it\u2019s very likely that an early step would be to stop reinvesting all or part of the securities whic h are coming\u2014which are maturing.", "But take note that that step, although a relatively modest step, does const itute a policy tighteni ng because it would be lowering the size of our balance sh eet and, therefore, would be expected to essentially tighten financial conditions.", "That being said, we therefore have to ma ke that decision based on the April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 14 of 26\u00a0\u00a0outlook, based on our view of how sustainable th e recovery is and what the condition\u2014the situation is respect to inflation.", "So we will base that decision on the evolving outlook.", "It depends on th e outlook.", "The Committee will have to make a judgment.", "Well, I should say, firs t of all, that, in terms of trying to help this economy stabilize and then recover, the Federal Rese rve has undertaken extraordinary measures.", "Those include, obviously, all the steps we  took to stabilize the financial system during the crisis\u2014again, many of which were extr aordinary measures taken under extreme circumstances.", "Even beyond the steps we took to  stabilize the system, we have created new ways to ease monetary policy.", "We\u2019ve brought the fe deral funds rate target  close to zero.", "We have used forward guidance in our language to af fect expectations of po licy changes.", "And, of course, as everyone knows, we have now been through two rounds of purchases of longer-term securities, which have seemed to have been effective in easing fi nancial conditions and, therefore, providing support for recovery and fo r employment.", "Going forward, we\u2019ll have to continue to make judgments abou t whether additional steps are warranted.", "But as we do so, we have to keep in mind that we do have a dual ma ndate, that we do have to worry about both the rate of growth but also the inflation rate.", "A nd as I was indicating earl ier, I think that\u2014even purely from an employment persp ective\u2014that if inflation were to become unmoored, inflation expectations were to rise signifi cantly, that the cost of that in  terms of employment loss in the future, as we had to respond to that, would be quite  significant.", "And so we do have to make sure April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 15 of 26\u00a0\u00a0that we are paying adequate atten tion to both sides of our mandate.", "But clearly it is the case that we have done extraordinary things in orde r to try to help this economy recover.", "Well, fi rst, I do believe th at the second round of securities purchases was effective.", "We saw that first in the financial markets.", "The way monetary policy always works is by easing financial conditions.", "And we saw increases in stock prices.", "We saw reduced spreads in credit market s.  We saw reduced volatility.", "We saw all the changes in financial markets and quite significa nt changes that one w ould expect if one was doing an ordinary easing of policy via a reduced federal funds rate.", "And, indeed, we saw the same types of financial market responses in the first round, which began in March of 2009.", "So we were able to get the financial easing that we were trying to get.", "We did get very significant easing from this program.", "You would expect , based on decades of experience, that easing financial conditions would lead to better economic conditions, and I think the evidence is consistent with that as well.", "As I discussed in more detail in my Humphrey\u2013Hawkins testimony in the beginning of March, between late August wh en I first indicated th at the Federal Reserve was seriously considering this additional step an d early this year, not only the Federal Reserve but many outside forecasters upgra ded their forecasts.", "And we saw\u2014we saw strengthening labor market conditions, higher rates of payroll job creation, et cetera.", "Now, the conclusion, therefore, that the second round of securiti es purchases was ineffective c ould only be validated if one thought that this\u2014this step was a panacea, that it was going to solve all the problems and return April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 16 of 26\u00a0\u00a0us to full employment overnight.", "And, indeed, we published some analytics which gave job crea tion numbers which were  significant but not\u2014certainly not enough to completely solve the enor mous jobs problem that we have.", "The tradeoffs are getting\u2014are getting less attractive at this point.", "Inflation has gotten hi gher.", "Inflation expectat ions are a bit higher.", "It\u2019s not clear that we can get substantial im provements in payrolls without some additional inflation risk.", "And, in my view , if we\u2019re going to have success in creating a long-run sustainable recovery with lots of job growth, we\u2019ve got to ke ep inflation under control.", "So we\u2019ve got to look at both of those\u2014both parts of the ma ndate as we\u2014as we choose policy.", "Our anticipation is that oil prices will stabilize or tend to come down.", "If that happens or if at least oil prices don\u2019t increase si gnificantly further, then inflation will\u2014will come down, and we\u2019ll have\u2014we\u2019ll be close to our medium-term objectives.", "So, as we look at oil prices, you know, as you point out, we have to look at both sides of the situati on.", "I do think that one of the key things that we\u2019ll be looking at will be in flation expectations because, if medium-term April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 17 of 26\u00a0\u00a0inflation expectations remain we ll anchored and stable so that firms are not passing on\u2014at least on an ongoing, sustained basis\u2014thes e higher costs into broader pr ices, into creating a broader inflation in the economy, as l ong as inflation expectations ar e well\u2014are well stabilized, that won\u2019t happen, then we\u2019ll feel more comfortable just watching and waiting and seeing how things evolve.", "Again, if we fear that inflation exp ectations look like they\u2019r e becoming less anchored, we would have to respond to that.", "Long-term unemployment in the current economy is\u2014is the wors t\u2014really the worst it\u2019s been in the postwar period.", "Currently something like 45 percent of all the unemployed have been unemployed for six months or longer.", "And we know the conseque nces of that can be very distressing because people who are out of work for a long time, thei r skills tend to atrophy\u2014th ey lose contacts with the labor market, with other people working, the networks that they have built up.", "And we saw in the European experience, for example, in  the \u201980s and \u201990s, th at a period of high unemployment with very long-te rm unemployment spells can act ually lead unemployment to remain very high for a protracted period.", "And it\u2019s one of the reasons that\u2014that the Federal Reserve has been  so aggressive.", "By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who\u2019ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoi d the longer-term consequences of  people being out of work for months at a time.", "As the situation drags on and as the long-term unempl oyed lose skills and lose contact with the labor April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 18 of 26\u00a0\u00a0market or perhaps just become discouraged and stop looking for work, then it becomes really out of the scope of monetary policy.", "At that poi nt, job training, educati on, and other types of interventions would probably be more  effective than monetary policy.", "Well, indirectly, of  course, if\u2014to the extent that we can help the economy recover and he lp job creation proceed, then so me of the people who get jobs will be those who\u2019ve been out of work for a long time.", "That being said, we don\u2019t have any tools for targeting long-term unemployment specificall y.", "We just\u2014can just try to make the labor market work better, broadly speaking.", "Well, in one sens e, S&P\u2019s action didn\u2019t really tell us anything because everybody who reads the newspape r knows that the United States has a very serious long-term fiscal problem.", "I think it\u2019s the most important economic problem, at least in the longer term, that the United States faces.", "We currently have a fiscal deficit which is simply not sustainable over the longer term.", "And if it\u2019s not the addressed, it will have significant consequences for financial stability, for economic growth, and for our standard of living.", "It is encouraging that we are seeing efforts on both sides of the aisle to think a bout
