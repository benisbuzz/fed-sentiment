coronavirus.", "On behalf of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve, our first concern is for those who \u2019ve been harmed.", "Families, businesses, schools, organizations, and governments at all levels are taking steps to protect peopl e\u2019s health.", "These measures, which are essential for containing the outbreak, will nonetheless understandably take a toll on economic activity in the near term.", "While the primary response to this challenge will come from our health -care providers and poli cy experts, economic policymakers must do what we can to ease hardship caused by the disruptions to the economy and to support a swift return to normal once they have passed.", "The Federal Reserve \u2019s role is guided by our mandate from Congress to promote maxi mum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.", "Today we reduced the target range for our policy interest rate by 1 percentage point, bringing it close to zero, and said that we expect to maintain the rate at this level until we\u2019re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track  to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.", "In addition, we took other actions to support the flow  of credit to households and businesses.", "Before describing our actions more fully, I will share how my colleagues and I currently view the economic outlook.", "The economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing.", "The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half -century lows for almost two years.", "Job gains have been running at a solid pace, well above what is needed to March 15, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 2 of 21   provide jobs for new entrants into the labor market.", "Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years remained near its highest rate in more than a decade.", "And  wages have been rising, particularly for lower -paying jobs.", "Overall economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate, even though weak growth abroad and trade d evelopments have been weighing on some sectors.", "U.S. banks are strong, have high levels of capital and liquidity, and are well positioned to provide credit to households and businesses.", "Against this favorable backdrop, the virus presents significant economic challenges.", "Like others, we expect that the illness  and the measures now being put in place to stem its spread will have a significant effect on economic activity in the near term.", "Those in travel, tourism, and hospitality industries are already seeing a sharp drop in business.", "In addition, the effects of the outbreak are restraining economic activity in many foreign economies, which is causing difficulties for U.S. industries that rely on global supply chains.", "The weakness abroad will also weigh on our exports for a time.", "Moreover, the energy sector has recently come under stress because of the large drop in global oil prices.", "Inflation, which has continued to run below our symme tric 2 percent objective, will likely be held down this year by the effects of the outbreak.", "Financial conditions have also tightened markedly.", "The cost of credit has risen for all but the strongest borrowers, and stock markets around the world are down s harply.", "Moreover, the rapidly evolving situation has led to high volatility in financial markets as everyone tries to assess the path ahead.", "In the past week, several important financial markets, including the market for U.S. Treasury securities, h ave at times  shown signs of stress and impaired liquidity.", "The market for Treasury securities is a critical part of the foundation of the global financial system.", "It is generally the most liquid of all markets and serves as the benchmark by which many other fin ancial assets are valued.", "It plays an important role in allowing households March 15, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 3 of 21   and firms to earn a safe return and manage their risks.", "When stresses arise in the Treasury market, they can reverberate through the entire financial system and the economy.", "To prevent this from happening and to support the smooth functioning of the Treasury market, we announced today that we will purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities over the coming months.", "Similar stresses have also emerged in the market for agency mortgage -backed securities, which is closely linked to the Treasury market and critically supports the ability of people to get a mortgage to buy a house or refinance an existing mortgage.", "To improve the functioning of this market and to ensure the ef fective transmission of monetary policy to borrowers in the economy, we will also purchase at least $200 billion of agency mortgage -backed securities over coming months and immediately cease the runoff of these securities in our portfolio.", "While the prima ry purpose of these securities purchases is to restore smooth market functioning so that credit can continue to flow, the purchases will also foster more accommodative financial conditions.", "The Federal Reserve announced a number of other actions today to s upport the flow of credit to households and businesses, thereby promoting our maximum employment and price stability goals.", "First, we reduced the interest rate on discount window loans by 1\u00bd percentage points, bringing tha t rate to \u00bc percent.", "The discount window plays an important role in supporting liquidity and stability in the banking system, and we encourage banks to turn to the discount window to help meet demands for credit from households and businesses.", "To make th e discount window more effective, we will also offer discount window loans for periods up to 90 days.", "Because of the importance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, strains in markets for borrowing and lending dollars overseas can disrupt financial conditions here in the United States.", "March 15, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 4 of 21   To guard against such disruptions, the Federal Reserve maintains swap lines with five major central banks.", "When dollar funding pressures emerge abroad, those central banks can contain the pressures in their jurisdictio ns and prevent them from impeding the flow of credit here at home.", "To address potential pressures in these markets during the current period of elevated uncertainty, we made a coordinated announcement with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to reduce the pricing on our dollar swap lines.", "In addition, our central bank counterparts will begin offering dollars to institutions in their jurisdictions for a term of 84 days in addition to the usual one -week operation.", "These long- standing  arrangements carry no risk to the Federal Reserve or to the American taxpayer.", "I won\u2019t go into detail on the other actions we took today, but they involved eliminating reserve requirements for banks and encouraging banks to make use of intraday credit with the Federal Reserve and to use their capital and liquidity buffers as they support lending to households and businesses.", "The actions we have announced today will help American families and businesses and, indeed, our entire economy weather  this difficult period and will foster a more vigor \u2014more vigor ous return to normal once the disruptions from the coronavirus abate.", "We will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments a nd their implications for the economic outlook.", "We are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and business, to help keep the economy strong, and to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals.", "March 15, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 5 of 21   Finally, let me note that today\u2019s FOMC meeting today was in lieu of the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday.", "So, based on our discussions today and many conversations with participants, it \u2019s fair to say that we have a range of views about the path of the economy, as is always the case with the Fed.", "But, in general, I\u2019d say that we see the U.S. economy as having been in quite a strong position before the arrival of the virus.", "We see that it is likely that the measures we take to protect ourselves from the virus will involve withdrawing from or reducing certain activities \u2014thinking there of travel, leisure, hospitality, those things \u2014and that \u2019s going to mean lower economic activity for a period of time.", "So that means th at the second quarter is probably going to be weak \u2014in fact, in the view of many, output declining \u2014output  lower in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter.", "After that, it\u2019 s very hard to say how big the effects will be or how long they will last .", "And that \u2019s March 15, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 6 of 21   going to depend, of course , on how widely the virus spreads, which is something that is highly uncertain, and I would say , in fact, unknowable.", "We do know that the virus will run its course and that the U.S. economy will resume a normal level of activity.", "In the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy \u2014ultimately , to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible.", "I would point out that we have , of course , responded very strongly not just with interest rates, but also with liquidity measures today.", "And we believe that what we did today will be beneficial to financial markets generally.", "And as I said in my statement, we \u2019re prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.", "So, a s I\u2019ve noted on a number of occasions, really, the Committee \u2014as you know, we did a year -plus-long study of our tools and strategies and communications.", "And we , really , at the end of that, and also when we started out, we view forward guidance and asset pu rchases\u2014asset purchases and also different variations and combinations of those tools as the basic elements of our toolkit once the federal funds rate reaches the effective lower bound\u2014so, really , forward guidance, asset purchases, and combinations of thos e.  You know, we looked at negative policy rates during the Global F inancial C risis, we monitored the ir use in other March 15, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 7 of 21   jurisdictions , we continue to do so, but we do not see negative policy rates as likely to be an appropriate policy response here in the United States.", "So what our liquidity operations \u2014and I\u2019ll talk specifically about the T reasury and MBS purchases \u2014are designed to do is to assure the proper functioning of the T reasury and MBS markets.", "The Treasury market is one of the most important, perhaps the most important, market in the world.", "It\u2019s probably the most l iquid large market in the world.", "The MBS market is very important:   It\u2019s closely linked to the Treasury market , and it\u2019s the way that our monetary policy decisions flow through to borrowers in the real econom y.", "So, two very important markets.", "And after that, we bought assets across the curve to try to support liquidity and return to normal function.", "And we knew what we had to do, which was the asset purchase program s that we did today.", "And those are designed to restore those key markets to normal function.", "These markets are part of the foundation of the global financial system and of the United States financial system.", "And if they are not functioning well, then other markets \u2014then that will spread to other markets.", "And those are the markets that \u2014that amount to \u2014that \u2014where households and businesses typically get credit.", "So we know that dysfunctional financial markets \u2014a dysfunctional financial system, really, can have very big negative effects on the economy.", "We saw that during  the financial crisis.", "This is a very different situation , but, nonetheless, we thought it was quite important for us to take strong measures to support \u2014to support  proper market function in these important markets.", "Now, you asked about households.", "It\u2019s true, we don \u2019t have the tools to reach individuals and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work or whose businesses may not \u2014may experience a period of very low activity.", "I mean , I think th at, by far , the most important is the response of the health- care workers and health -care policymakers.", "After that, fiscal policy.", "We \u2019ve had one round of fiscal policy, another coming.", "I think fiscal policy is a way to direct relief , really , to particul ar populations and groups.", "Monetary policy has a role , and it really is in , you know \u2014our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they\u2019re under stress , and that\u2019s\u2014that \u2019s really part of what we did today.", "The other role is to suppor t demand through lower interest rates, and we did that.", "You\u2014you asked about fiscal as well , and I guess I \u2019ve sort of covered that.", "We do think fiscal response is \u2014is critical , and we \u2019re happy to see that those measures are being considered , and we \u2014we  hope they are effective.", "So, on\u2014on inflation, you know , the\u2014the econom y\u2019s performed so well, really , over the last few years , and right up through January :  historically low unemployment \u201450- year-low unemployment for a couple of years, 11 years \u2014almost 11 years of expansion so far , and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent.", "So we \u2019ve been concerned that inflation not move down further.", "It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way.", "So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judge d that the \u2014the  net effects of this will be to \u2014to have inflation move down e ven a little bit more.", "Again, it \u2019s just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further.", "We expect, with uncertainty, that , you know \u2014that it will fall a little bit further , at least , below where it has been.", "We are\u2014of course, we don \u2019t have the legal authority to buy other securities other than the ones we already buy , and we \u2019re not seeking authority to do so.", "We haven \u2019t discussed that at the \u2014at the  FOMC , and it\u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s n ot legal authority that we \u2019re seeking.", "So w hat\u2014what  I can tell you definitive ly is what the purpose of the asset purchases was , and I mentioned this in my statement.", "And it really is to support the availability of credit in the economy \u2014households and businesses \u2014and thereby support the overall economy.", "They d o that by supporting proper market functioning in the T reasury market and the MBS market.", "So you see \u2014and I think you \u2019ll see \u2014as these purchases roll forward, you will see the T reasury market and the MBS market returning to normal market function , and that will actually support economic activity.", "That will be a positive for economic activity.", "In terms of what it\u2019 s labeled , that \u2019s of less interest to me.", "I really  think we are very clear in our minds what we \u2019re doing this for and what the logical effects would be, which would be \u2014which would be both better market function and\u2014 and\u2014you know, when there \u2019s better market function, it will be \u2014you know, policy will be supporting the economy better.", "The Desk is going to go out , and it \u2019s going to buy at a strong rate that is \u2014that we think will restore market function\u2014restore liquidity as quickly as it can be restored.", "And that language is open ended , and it\u2019s meant to send a signal to the market that\u2014that , you know, we \u2019re not going to be bound by, for example, $60 billion a month or anything like that.", "We \u2019re going to go in strong starting tomorrow , and we \u2019re going to buy across the curve , and we \u2019re going to buy MBS , and we\u2019re really going to use our tools to do what we need to do here, which is restore these important markets to normal function.", "As far as \u2014as the policy rate, what we \u2019ve said is that we  will maintain the rate at this level until we \u2019re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.", "And if you\u2014if you  look at it, you\u2019 ll see that some things have to happen March 15, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 12 of 21   before we\u2019 d consider \u2014we\u2019d have to become confident of \u2014that the economy has weathered these recent events and also is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.", "I think we do, actually, work pretty closely with the Treasury Department and\u2014and  cooperate with them on things , with clear lines of delineation.", "For example, the Treasury Department has authority over fiscal policy.", "That \u2019s not our job.", "It\u2019s their job , with other parts of the Administration.", "It\u2019s just that \u2014like that for us with monetary policy.", "We have sole responsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an independent, nonpolitical way.", "But in the middle there, there are areas where we \u2014where we can cooperate.", "And also, there\u2019 s a long history .", "You would want the finance ministry and  the t reasury [and the central bank] to be talking in every major

through the organization.", "For example, the New York Fed is March 15, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 13 of 21   the Treasury \u2019s agent\u2014fiscal agent , as you know , so there \u2019s a lot that goes into debt management and the issuance of debt , which happens at the New York Fed.", "And  there is \u2014there\u2019 s also quite a lot of coordination in other respects  with \u2014of course , with foreign central banks, but you didn\u2019 t ask about that.", "And also, we\u2019re\u2014 you know , we\u2019re not having a lot of big, crowded meetings

So we \u2019re trying to observe all of the things that the professionals tell us to do.", "In terms of our \u2014of our toolkit, let me say first that, you know , I think we do have plenty of space to adjust our policy.", "I mentioned our liquidity tools \u2014you know , we have a lot of power in our liquidity tools , and, as I mentioned , we\u2019re prepared to use t hem.", "In addition, we \u2019ve got plenty of space left to offer forward guidance, asset purchases, and adjust those policies , so I March 15, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 14 of 21   think we do have room.", "So why no \u2014I guess you \u2019re asking , why no SEP , and what \u2019s our forecast?", "So, in terms of fiscal policy, I thi nk in the first instance \u2014and you\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re  seeing some of this now \u2014is the thing that fiscal policy and , really , only fiscal policy can do is reach out directly to affected industries, affected workers , and we \u2019ve seen some of that.", "So, that \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s  an imp ortant job for fiscal policy.", "More broadly, after that , there \u2019s the question of \u2014of fiscal \u2014broader fiscal stimulus , and I think that \u2019ll depend on the path of the economy.", "Well, I think , in the very near term , we\u2019re going to be looking at , you know , the Treasury market function.", "We \u2019re really going to be looking to see that financial markets are returning to more liquid , more normal functioning.", "That is  an essential part of our job.", "That is \u2014actually , you know, that is the thing that central banks were originally designed to do, was to provide liquidity to financial systems in stress , so we take that job very seriously.", "So we \u2019ll be watching that a nd we \u2019ll be prepared to use our tools when and as appropriate to address \u2014to\u2014to support market functioning and really to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.", "You know, in terms of economic data, I think it \u2019s just so early.", "You know, we \u2019re really looking \u2014I mean , the economic data will follow the data on the spread of the virus.", "You know, I think what happens \u2014what happens  during the spread of the virus is probably not going to tell you a lot about where the economy will be in six months.", "If it lasts longer \u2014so that \u2019s really what I \u2019ll be looking for , is\u2014is what is going to be the spread of the virus and what \u2019s the path it\u2019 s going to take and what are the effects on the economy.", "First, it\u2019 s the measures that we take to , you know , to\u2014with the social distancing , and the \u2014all the things businesses and school and everyone \u2019s doing  now .", "In terms of the toolbox, as I mentioned, we think we have plenty of policy space left, plenty of power left in our tools , and I would point in particular to the  liquidity tools.", "Our interest rates will matter \u2014cuts will matter now to borrowers who will get some relief from our cuts , but they \u2019ll March 15, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 18 of 21   matter a lot more when the economy begins to recover.", "So \u2014but in the forefront now are the liquidity tools and\u2014and  getting that job done well.", "In addition, as I mentioned, we \u2014you know , we have room to provide forward guidance, to do more asset purchases.", "I\u2014I would just close , though,  by saying  that, you know , typically , fiscal policy does play a major role when \u2014when  there are downturns.", "Sometimes fiscal policy comes in on a discretionary basis , and that \u2014that  will probably need to be the case here as well.", "FSOC is really something that the Treasury Secretary chairs.", "But, you know, you should know that we are , of course , in regular contact with the other regulatory agencies , constantly talking about what \u2019s

on\u2014in high uncertainty , and that \u2019s why you see lots and lots of volatility.", "I think there \u2019s more risk to financial stability in an era like \u2014like  that than there is when things are really placid , and, you know, we \u2019re going home at 4 o\u2019 clock and kind of bored over here.", "So, financial stability \u2014I would say those \u2014those  risks do rise at a time of high volatility, particularly a time where we \u2019re presenting \u2014presented with a challenge that is \u2014is kind of unique , really \u2014it\u2019s not something we \u2019ve all done

2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Call   FINAL   Page 20 of 21   10 years will pay dividends , in the sense that you have a much more resilient fi nancial system than you\u2019 ve had before.", "Yes, so we saw, and everyone saw , that liquidity had become very strained in Treasury and MBS markets , and we decided to offer very large quantities of term and overnight repo to address that.", "That makes it easier to finance the purchase of repos \u2014sorry, of Treasuries and M", "We  have given broad general guidance to the banks.", "There \u2014there are a lot of discussions
