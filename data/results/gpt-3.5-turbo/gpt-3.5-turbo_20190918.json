funds rate .", "As our statement also highlights , though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments .", "And if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate .", "In other words, as we say in our statement, we will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we will act as appropriate to help ensure that the ex pansion remains on track.", "So the idea of having a bias is something that was a longtime practice, and we don \u2019t actually have that practice anymore, so I can \u2019t really adopt it right here .", "So we did\u2014we made one decision today, and September 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 6 of 26  that decision was to lower the federal funds rate by \u00bc percentage point .", "Our decisions are going to depend on the implications of incoming information for the outlook, and I would also say, as we often do, that we

on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can\u2014I think that \u2019s a good idea in principle , and I think history teaches us that it \u2019s better to be proactive in adjusting policy if you can.", "I think applying that principle in a particula r situation is where the challenge comes.", "So I told you where  the C ommittee \u2014the bulk of the Committee is going , meeting by meeting, and I think the main takeaway is that this is a C ommittee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly, September 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 8 of 26  consistently , through the course of the year to support economic activity as it has  felt that it \u2019s appropriate .", "At the beginning of the year we were looking at further rate increases, then we were

large bond purchases .", "And, by the way, our sense is that it surprised market participants a lot , too.", "So, as I mentioned, it doesn\u2019 t\u2014we don \u2019t see this as havin g any implications for the broader economy or for the economic outlook, n or for our ability to control rates .", "The strains in the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I think most folks anticipated \u2014strong demand for cash to purchase T reasuries and pay corporate taxes.", "We took appropriate actions to address those pressures, to keep the fed funds rate within the target range, and those measures were successful .", "If we experience another episode of pressures in money markets, we have the tools to address those pressures.", "Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the C ommittee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime.", "We think it works well to implement our rate decisions .", "The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered rates\u2014 the IOER and RRP rates\u2014to keep the fed fund rates in the target range.", "It \u2019s designed specifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that purpose .", "So, going forward, we \u2019re going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we\u2019 re going to be assessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organi c growth of our balance sheet .", "And I \u2019m sure we\u2019 ll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting  period and certainly at our next meeting.", "So we \u2019ve always said that it \u2019s\u2014that the level is uncertain, right ?", "And as you know, we \u2019ve invested lots of time talking to many of the large holde rs of reserves to assess their \u2014what they say is their demand for reserves.", "But , yes, there \u2019s real uncertainty, and it is certainly possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought .", "Again, we \u2019ll be looking at this carefully in coming days and taking it up at the next meeting.", "It\u2019s not an official finding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System .", "And, you know, what this particular piece of work did is , it went after measuring trade September 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of

.", "And while I would say, directly answering your question, there \u2019s real uncertainty around these \u2014around these effects.", "It\u2019 s a $22 trillion  economy.", "So, I mean , I think if you take a step back from that, we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an effect .", "You see it in weak business investment, weak exports \u2014hard to quantify it precisely , though.", "You know, honestly, I think it \u2019s hard to have hardened expectations about where rate policy is going to be a year from now .", "I think the closer you get to the c urrent day, the more confidence  you can have .", "But even then, knowing where the\u2014knowi ng what the September 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 12 of 26  data will say and the way geopolitical events and other events are going to evolve in the next 90 days and the implications of that for the economy, I would say there \u2019s a lot of uncertainty around that .", "Particularly, if you look at 2020, I think the use of this is , individual participants write down their forecast s.  It should give you a sense of how people are thinking about the likely path of the economy and the appropriate path for mone tary policy in that individual person\u2019 s thinking, and I think that \u2019s a good thing to know .", "economy, the U.S .", "economy has generally per formed roughly as expected \u2014roughly:   The consumer is spending at a healthy clip,  I \u2019d say business fixed

think if you look at \u2014the global economy, I think , has weakened further in the EU and China, and I think, you know, trade policy developments have been a big mover of markets and of sentiment during that inter meeting  period.", "So that \u2019s why I think what \u2019s\u2014that \u2019s what \u2019s happened over the inter meeting  period, and, you know, different people around the table

with the level of reserves?", "You know, so I think if we concluded that we needed to raise the level of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we\u2019 d probably raise the level of reserves rather than lower the L", "I think we want banks to, you know \u2014to use their liquidity buffers in times of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients as a general rule.", "So my point , really , was that \u2014to start , that trade pol icy is not the business of the F ed, it \u2019s the business of Congress and the A dministration .", "We \u2019re talking about it because anything tha t affects the achievement of our  goals can , in principle , be something that monetary policy should take into consideration.", "And our discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that \u2019s weighing on the outlook.", "So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can \u2019t address, really , is what businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade .", "But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness , to some extent , by supporting demand through sound monetary policy.", "A nd we think our policy tools support economic activity through fairly well -understood channels :  by reducing interest September 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 15 of 26  burden and encouraging consumer purchase of durables , of homes , and other interest- sensitive items ; by creating broadly more accommodative financial conditions, which support spending and also investment by businesses ; and also by boosting household and business confidence .", "And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to the underlying forces, the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate .", "We don\u2019 t\u2014we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements .", "We\u2019re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum employment and stable prices.", "So we need to look through what \u2019s a pretty volatile situation .", "And, you know, I would say, the outlook is positive in the face of these crosswinds we\u2019 ve felt .", "And so, to some extent , I do believe that our shifting to a more accommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook has remained favorable.", "So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the events that are going on around the world, we \u2019ll be looking at, you know, the evolving geopolitical events , we\u2019ll be looking at global growth, w e\u2019ll be looking at trade policy uncertainty.", "economy.", "We\u2019ll be looking

forecasts show  growth similar to our own, forecasts coming in about 2 percent, which is a good, solid year.", "So the difference here is, we have significant , really , risks to that outlook from not just the geopolitical events , but also from slowing global growth and tra de policy uncertainty.", "So we \u2019ll be looking at all of that and also financial market conditions and how they are affecting the outlook.", "I can \u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a challenging time, I admit it, but we really have to be open to all those things .", "We\u2019re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting as we see this, and , you know, we \u2019ll try to be as transparent as we can as we go.", "You know, in terms of firepower, I think the general principle, as I mentione d earlier, is , it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn gains momentum, and then\u2014so there \u2019s a fair amount of research that would show that that \u2019s the case.", "Wha t we believe we\u2019 re facing here\u2014what we th ink we \u2019re facing here is a situation which can be addressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate.", "If , in fact , the economy weakens more, then we \u2019re prepared to be aggressive, and we \u2019ll do so if it turns out to be appropriate.", "You mentioned negative interest rates.", "So negative interest rates is some thing that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.", "We chose to \u2014after we got to the effective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large -scale asset purchases, and those were the two unconventional  monetary policy tools that we used extensively.", "We did not use negative rates .", "And I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound\u2014again, not something we are expecting\u2014 then I think we would look at using large -scale asset purchases and forward guidance.", "I do not think we \u2019d be looking at using negative rates.", "By the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy re view where we \u2019re looking through all of these questions about the longer -run framework \u2014the strategy , tools , and communications \u2014and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year.", "So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first, we th ink monetary policy works with, as Friedman said , long and variable lags.", "But, you know, we think that l ower interest rates will reduce  interest burden for borrowers , so that interest -sensitive things like housing and durable goods and other things like that \u2014cars \u2014it supports purchases of those.", "Just, again, broadly, more accommodative financial conditions \u2014higher asset prices.", "T hat\u2019s\u2014the models and the data show  that that\u2019s another powerful channel.", "I also think there \u2019s a confidence channel.", "You see \u2014you see household and business confidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative.", "So I think, through all of those channels , monetary policy works.", "It isn \u2019t, you know, precisely the right tool for every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but , nonetheless, it broadly works, and, you know, we \u2019re going to use the tool  we have.", "We \u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll us e our tools to offset negative \u2014that\u2019s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away

ve got more income relative to their interest requirements.", "And they \u2019re in very good shape \u2014much better shape than they were in before the financial crisis.", "So the household sector as a sort of aggregate matter is in very good shape.", "That doesn\u2019 t mean that every single person in the household sector is in good shape, but , overall , it\u2019s really not a concern.", "The business sector is something that, you know, we \u2019ve talked about a lot and studied a lot, and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a high level.", "However, so is the size of the business sector.", "So, actually, the business sector itself is not materially higher leverage d tha n it was.", "Nonetheless, there are a lot of highly levered companies, and that \u2019s the kind of thing that  happens during a long cycle when there aren \u2019t downturns for , now , into our 11th year.", "You get \u2014you know, you do get that kind of phenomenon in a long cycle.", "So that \u2019s something we \u2019re monitoring, and I think our view still is that that\u2019 s a real issue, but what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn.", "It does  not have the makings of anything that w ould undermine the workings of the  financial system, for example, or itself create a shock that would turn

know, so, I think\u2014 and my colleagues and I , I think, all think that the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent.", "And I think that \u2019s, by the way, widely shared among forecasters.", "You know, the issue is more the risks to that.", "You have downside risks here, and we\u2019ve talked about them.", "It \u2019s that global growth will have an effect on U.S. growth over time \u2014 less so than for many other economies, but , still, there \u2019s a sector of our economy that \u2019s exposed to that.", "Tra de policy uncertainty also has \u2014apparently has an effect.", "So \u2014and you can see some weakness in the U.S. economy because of all that.", "But , nonetheless \u2014so the job of monetary policy is to adjust both to e nsure against  those downside risks , but also to support the economy in light of the existing weakness that we do see.", "So we \u2019re not \u2014as I mentioned , we\u2019re not \u2014we don\u2019t see a recession.", "We\u2019 re not forecasting a recession.", "But we are adjusting monetary policy in a more accommodative direction to try to support what is , in fact , a favorable outlook.", "No, we do \u2014so we monitor the yield curve carefully,  along with a large , wide range of financial conditions.", "We don\u2019t \u2014so, it\u2019s not \u2014there \u2019s no one thing that is dispositive among all financial conditions.", "The yield curve is something that we follow carefully.", "And, again, based on our assessment of all the data, we still think it \u2019s a positi ve outlook.", "The thing\u2014so , just to talk about the current situation, you see \u2014you saw long- term rates move down a whole lot and then retrace two -thirds of that move in the space of a few days.", "So I think what really matters for all financial conditions gen erally is when there are changes\u2014material changes that are sustained for a period of time.", "So\u2014but why are long -term rates low?", "There are a number \u2014there can be a signal about expectations about growth there for sure, but there can also just be low  term premiums.", "For example, just \u2014well, it can just be that there \u2019s this large quantity of negative -yielding and very low-yielding sovereign debt around the world, and, inevitably , that \u2019s exerting downward pressure on U.S. sovereign rates without really ne cessarily having an independent signal.", "Nonetheless, that is a signal about weak global growth, probably, and weak global growth would affect us.", "So global capital markets and the global economy are quite integrated, so this is something we  pay careful \u2014we\u2019re not going to be dismissive about the yield curve, but \u2014and I think you can tell, on the C ommittee , there \u2019s a range of views \u2014there are some who are very focused on the yield curve, others not so much.", "You know, from my perspective, you watch it careful ly, and, you know, I think you need to be asking yourself a lot of questions if the yield curve is inverted as to why that is and how long it \u2019s sustained.", "You know, I \u2019d love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward stopping rule, but it \u2019s really just goin g to be when we think we \u2019ve done enough.", "A nd, you know, our eyes are open.", "We \u2019ve cut rates twice.", "We\u2019 ve moved, really , through the course of this year, as I discussed, and , you know, we see ourselves as taking actions to sustain the expansion and thereby achieve our goals.", "And if you look at sort of the things that are happening in the economy, I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion, because we really are reaching \u2014this positive economy is reaching communities that haven\u2019 t been reached in a long time.", "There would be great benefit in having that last as long as possible, that\u2019s all.", "So I don\u2019 t have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we \u2019re watching carefully, and there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we \u2019ve done enough, but there may also come a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively.", "In terms of the morale of the institution, I would say it \u2019s very high.", "We feel like we\u2019 re doing the best job we can in ser ving the American people.", "You know, so I saw the headline , like, this morning during all of the preparation and everything and this
