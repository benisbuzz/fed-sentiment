\u2019s a real \u2014a real asset that we have.", "And so we think that inflation should move down over time.", "Now, we don\u2019 t have any\u2014much confidence, let \u2019s say, in the timing of

half of our mandate.", "Price stability is half of our mandate.", "And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently that were\u2014that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were  to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent .", "So we won \u2019t have an extended period of , of high inflation.", "We think that , that  some of it will, will  fall away naturally as the process of reopening the economy moves through.", "In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure that we do have inflation that averages 2  percent  over time.", "Well, so in terms of what\u2019 s been happening in bond markets, I don\u2019 t think there \u2019s a real consensus on , on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this meeting.", "We \u2019ve seen the long- term yields go down significantly.", "Some of it is a fall in real yields, which may have been

s significantly reversed.", "We are committed to achieving 2 percent  average inflation over time.", "What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won\u2019 t be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation.", "So we \u2019re, you know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  a ways away from full maximum employment.", "But we have high inflation, so it \u2019s kind of the opposite case.", "Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad based and likely to be persistent and , and, and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that , that  could cause them to rise.", "And , and I think the real test of it will be down the

unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum .", "That, that\u2019s,  that\u2019s the path that we \u2019re on, and, and it shouldn\u2019 t take that long in macroeconomic time to ge t there.", "And, again, it \u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s not  timely for us to be thinking about , about  raising interest rates right now.", "What we\u2019 re doing is , we\u2019re, we\u2019re

could do would be to just cut asset purchases all the way to zero if you wanted to do that.", "Ideally, you wouldn\u2019 t be still buying assets and raising rates because, of course, you \u2019re adding July 28, 2021   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 14 of 29   accommodation by buying and, and removing accommodation by raising rates.", "Maybe the place to start is, is  just to say that this is n ow not so much about people going back to their old jobs.", "It\u2019 s about finding a new job.", "So that \u2019s a time- intensive, labor -intensive process.", "So it \u2019s not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of the recovery going back in a single month because they\u2019 re just going back to their old job.", "This is about job selection, things like that.", "There may also be some factors th at are \u2014that are holding people back, and that \u2019s\u2014this is what surveys say.", "So if you remember the , the summer wave last year of COVID, which was largely southern and w estern states, the economy just performed much better July 28, 2021   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 16 of 29   than anyone expected.", "And then this big second wave hit, and I think the natural thing to do is to expect that , that it would have a real impact on the economy.", "A lot of jobs were lost then because that was a very strong wave that happened in, in, in the winter months last yea r, just before the vaccines arrived.", "Again, with , with, with  a reasonably high percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective \u2014we \u2019re not experts on this \u2014but it , it seems like the\u2014a  good \u2014a good going- in estimate would be that the effects will probably be less.", "July 28, 2021   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 17 of 29   In terms of the , the, the  channels, you know, I \u2014this is \u2014this is kind of speculation, but it\u2019s pretty \u2014it just is that people, you could imagine school districts deciding to wait a month or two for the \u2014for the \u2014for the  Delta wave to go .", "If, if schools don\u2019 t open, then caretakers have to stay home.", "And if people don\u2019 t go back into the labor force, then the job growth won\u2019 t be as strong, those kinds of things.", "And they\u2014it may be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months \u2014or not.", "There are many parts of the country where it might not have an effect, and we \u2019re just going to have to, to see what the economic effects are.", "It means that the increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will stop so that \u2014so that there won\u2019 t be further\u2014when , when we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year.", "That \u2019s inflation.", "When you have inflation for 12 mo nths or whatever it might be \u2014I\u2019m just taking an example ; I\u2019m not making an estimate \u2014then, then  you have a price increase, but you don\u2019 t have an inflation process.", "And so part of that just is that, if it doesn \u2019t affect longer- term inflation expectations, t hen it \u2019s very likely not to infect \u2014to affect the process of inflation going forward.", "So what , what  I mean by \u201ctransitory \u201d is just something that doesn \u2019t leave a permanent mark on the inflation process.", "Again, we don\u2019 t mean \u2014I don\u2019 t mean that,  that, that, t hat, you know, producers are going to take those price increases back.", "So to the extent people are , are, are implementing price increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something \u2019s going up, you know, the question,  really , for inflation really is, does that mean they \u2019re going to go up the next year by the same amount?", "So you\u2019 re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process , gets going.", "And, and that happens because people \u2019s expectations about future inflation move up.", "But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is \u2014you know, we have two mandates:   maximum employment and price stability.", "Price stability , for us , means inflation averaging 2 percent  over time.", "But, but I, I, I think it \u2019s a good point that it \u2019s, it\u2019s a term \u2014what it really means is temporary.", "In terms of \u2014so we \u2019re, we\u2019re  working virtually here, and we \u2019ll be coming back down the road in a couple of months, starting to bring people back here at the B oard of G overnors in Washington.", "We really haven \u2019t made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like.", "And those views ultimately track , track  back to people \u2019s views about the economy and, and what  will happen as we make progress toward s, towards our \u2014towards our goal.", "And it was a good meeting.", "And we expect that, if, if  things go well, then we will \u2014we will reach that goal .", "And when we reach it and the Committee is comfortable that we have reached it, then , then we\u2019ll taper at that point.", "W e\u2014asset purchases were just a key part of our response to the critical phase of the crisis.", "They , they  really helped us restore market function to these key markets, really, on which\u2014on which , which  are very, very important to our economy and the global economy.", "And then they were a big part of , of creating accommodative financial conditions to support demand.", "It was that commitment to continue asset purchases that provided strong support for the economy and, and has been a part of the story for why the economy is so strong right now.", "I mean, it \u2019s\u2014and, and, again, we \u2019re talking about it right now and meeting by meeting and, and moving in that direction.", "We will taper when we reach that goal.", "Well, I think strong capital requirements are essential for banks, particula rly for the largest banks.", "And I think that an undercapitalized banking system, as we \u2019ve seen, can be a real threat to the economy and most \u2014mostly, or to , to the greatest extent, to July 28, 2021   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 22 of 29   people at the lower end of the income spectrum.", "So if you look back at not this previous \u2014not this crisis but the previous one, the bank\u2014the banking system was undercapitalized.", "So higher capital requirements are , are, you know, are , are really a good thing because they allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform.", "I think it \u2019s other tools that we have to \u2014and the Fed has some of these tools, Congress has some of these tools , other agencies have some of these tool s\u2014to assure or support the wide availability of credit, particularly to low - and moderate -income communities.", "So with inflation, as I mentioned, we\u2019re , we look not just at the headline number , but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation.", "And if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that , widely , across the whole range of goods and services that, that are in the economy, we \u2019re seeing  upward , upward pressure on prices.", "What we\u2019 re seeing is a handful of things that are really \u2014that really account for the , the overshoot of inflation.", "You know, new, used , and rental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage because of the semiconductor shortage.", "And housing \u2014sorry, hotels and air , air fares have moved back up, but that really just is retracing the very large downward movement in prices t hat they had before.", "So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a big, big part of , of why the inflation readings are so high.", "And those don\u2019t\u2014those , frankly , don \u2019t carry significant implications in the long run for the \u2014for inflation or for the American economy.", "So what I said w as, we, we\u2019re going to see whether these things \u2014we don\u2019 t need to see everything do what lumber prices have done.", "So if you look at lumber prices, they went up and then they went down.", "D o they\u2014do they\u2014do the prices flatten out?", "If they flatten out, then their , their contribution to inflation becomes zero over time so that they \u2019re not contributing to inflation.", "And I don\u2019 t think it will take , or what I said was , I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 ll take a very long time to see whether that \u2019s the case.", "It, it, it  is probably the case that, frankly, the , the

today\u2019 s meeting, as a matter of fact, and yesterday \u2019s meeting.", "And I \u2019ll just say that, generally speaking, I don\u2019 t think and\u2014I don\u2019 t think that \u2014I think th at Treasury and MBS purchases affect financial conditions in very similar ways.", "There may be modest differences in terms of , of contribution to housing prices, but it \u2019s, it\u2019s not

support the function of \u2014functioning of monetary policy and its , its effectiveness.", "Your question on, on the , the [ON] RRP,  so we think it \u2019s doing what it \u2019s supposed to do, what we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal funds, funds  rate stays within the target range.", "You know, it \u2019s essentially , essentially , what \u2019s happening is that it just results in a  lower aggregate amount of Federal Reserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal Reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight R RP balances.", "It \u2019s being driven, of course, by, by the relatively lower quantity of Treasury bills and, and, July 28, 2021
