Committee intends to take  when, at some point in the future, it becomes appropriate to be gin normalizing the stance of policy.", "Let me underscore that our release of this information is not meant to convey any change in the stance of policy.", "As you know, the FOMC\u2019s views on policy are conveyed in the policy statement, which I will now discuss before coming back to our normalization plans.", "As indicated in our policy statement, the FO MC decided to make another reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.", "The Committee also maintained its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and rea ffirmed its view that a highly ac commodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.", "Let me discuss the economic conditions that underpin these actions.", "The economy is continuing to make progress toward the FOMC\u2019s objective of maximum sustainable employment.", "In the labor market , conditions have improved further in recent months.", "Although the pace of job growth has sl owed some recently, job gains have averaged more than 200,000 per month over the past th ree months.", "The unemployment rate was 6.1 percent in August, two-tenths lower than the data available at  the time of the June FOMC meeting.", "Broader measures of labor market u tilization, such as the U-6 measure, have shown similar improvement, and the labor force part icipation rate has flattened out.", "These developments continue the trend of gradual progr ess toward our employment objective.", "But the labor market has yet to fully recover.", "There are still too many people who want jobs but cannot find them, too many who are working part time but  would prefer full-ti me work, and too many who are not searching for a job but would be if the labor market we re stronger.", "As noted in the September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 2 of 22 FOMC statement, \u201ca range of labor market indica tors suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources.\u201d The Committee continues to see sufficient und erlying strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.", "Althou gh real GDP rose at an annual rate of only about 1 percent in the first half of  the year, that modest gain reflect ed, in part, transitory factors, including a dip in net exports .", "Indeed, private domestic final demand\u2014that is, spending by domestic households and businesse s\u2014grew about twice as fast as  G", "So, of cour se, the Committee discussed its forward guidance today, and it discusses what the appropria te forward guidance is at every meeting.", "This is part of our assessment of economic conditions and the appropri ate stance of monetary policy.", "In terms of what the term \u201cconsiderable time\u201d means, th e Committee decided that, based on its assessment of economic conditions, that charac terization remains appropriate, a nd it was comfortable with it.", "I think if you look, for example, at the projections of  individual participants that are revealed in the SEP\u2014well, that\u2019s the view of each participant, and, again, I\u2019d emphasize, not a Committee collective view\u2014there  is relatively little cha nge in the assessment of the outlook by participants between this meeti ng and the assessment in June.", "So th e outlook is little changed\u2014a slight decline in the anticipated path of the unemploymen t rate and a very slight  uptick in the inflation projection, but really quite minimal.", "So, the ou tlook hasn\u2019t changed that much from June, and the Committee felt comfortable with this characterization.", "Now, you said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this calendar-based guida nce?\u201d  I want to emphasize that there is no mechanical interpretation of what the term \u201cconsiderable time\u201d means.", "And, as I\u2019ve said September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 9 of 22 repeatedly, the decisions that th e Committee makes about what is th e appropriate time to begin to raise its target for the federal funds rate will be data de pendent.", "And in my opening comments just now, I again emphasized something I\u2019ve said prev iously, which is that if  the pace of progress in achieving our goals were to quicken, if it we re to accelerate, it\u2019s likely that the Committee would begin raising its target fo r the federal funds rate sooner th an is now anticipated and might raise\u2014might then raise the federal funds rate at a faster pace.", "I think it would not be accura te to describe the Committee\u2019 s guidance about the timing of the federal funds rate and when it will move a bove zero as being calendar based.", "The Committee has started with a broad general statement of wh at determines how long it will keep the federal funds rate target at zero.", "It has said that it will be looking at  the actual and projected pace at which the gaps between our employment and infl ation, and our goals for those variables, are closing.", "And then what the Committee does at ea ch meeting is\u2014after saying that the assessment will take into account many different indicators and take into account inflation pressures and other things\u2014it goes on to provide at that meeting its assessment of the im plications of its view of the data at that time.", "And that assessmen t really hasn\u2019t change d over the last several meetings.", "The Committee, based on its assessmen t at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying that, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to maintain the current target range for a consider able time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percen t objective.", "So I wouldn\u2019 t describe that as\u2014I know \u201cconsiderable time\u201d sounds like it\u2019s a calendar concept, but it is highly  conditional, and it\u2019s linked to the Committee\u2019s assessment of the economy.", "Well, the grow th projections for 2014 are down a little bit, but the unemployment path is also marginally lower.", "So  while the projected path of the labor market\u2014unemployment and other measures of the labor market\u2014of course is partly dependent on the growth outlook, it isn\u2019t totally dependent on th e growth outlook.", "And the Committee assesses that the labor market is conti nuing to improve, and you see a sma ll reduction in the path of the unemployment this year and then over the rest of the projection period.", "So, if you ask me\u2014you asked me, \u201cWhy has the projected funds rate path moved up?\u201d  Well, you know, each participant knows the reason th ey wrote down what they did.", "But, as a guess, I would hazard\u2014first, I woul d say, there is relatively little  upward movement in the path, and I would view it as broadly in line with what  one would expect with a very small downward reduction in the path for unemployment and a very  slight upward change in the projection for inflation.", "So, most participants, in deciding on the path, I think, look at, as our guidance says, how large is the gap between pe rformance of the labor market and that associated with our maximum employment objective, how large is the gap between inflation and our 2 percent objective, how fast will those gaps change.", "I would describe  the change in the projections, both for the September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 11 of 22 economy and the path of rates, as quite modest.", "But the fact that they move does illustrate the data-dependence principle that I think is really so  important for market participants to keep in mind, that what we do will depend on how the data unfold.", "There is uncertainty about that.", "And as expectations and the actual performance of  the economy change, you should expect to see movements in the dots.", "You see a big range out in 2017, and that reflects, in part , different forecasts by different members of the Committee about how rapid progress will be.", "What you don\u2019t see in the dot\u2014so-called dot plot is also the uncertainty  that each individual, each participant, sees around their own projection.", "So things will de pend on how the economy evolves.", "That will change over time, and there\u2019s a good deal  of uncertainty a ssociated with it.", "Well, to my mi nd, the very slow pace of wage increases does reflect slack in the labor market.", "We had a very deep recession, as is perhaps to be expected in the aftermath of a very significant financial cr isis.", "We\u2019ve faced headwinds in the economy recovering, so the recovery has be en slow.", "Growth has been positive, and it\u2019s lasted for five years.", "But it\u2019s nevertheless been slow relative to  past recoveries that have not been associated with financial crises.", "And while unemployment has come way down from the slightly over 10 percent level it reached, at 6.1 percent, it remains significantly above the level that most September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 12 of 22 FOMC participants would regard as consistent with normal in the longer run, 5.2 to 5.5 percent.", "So there is significant underutilizat ion of labor resources.", "We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is  an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.", "And, as I went into de tail in Jackson Hole and w on\u2019t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization\u2014high levels  that have come down only very marginally of part-time employ ment for economic\u2014or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of la bor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.", "And so, I think there still is\u2014and the statement says it\u2014\u201csignificant underutilization of labor resources\u201d and a very modest pace of wage in creases that\u2019s picked up very little, I see as essentially a reflection of that.", "So, with respect to id entifying myself, the Committee has had discussions during the years that we have been pr oviding these forecasts of the participants to the public as to whether or not it\u2019s desirable fr om the standpoint of Committee functioning to identify who\u2019s who in these pictures.", "And thus fa r, while occasionally an individual will indicate September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 13 of 22 in a speech what their personal views are, we ha ve not yet decided that it would be a desirable thing for the point of view of our decisionmaki ng process to identify individuals.", "We have a subcommittee on communications that\u2019s now chaire d by Vice Chair Fischer, and they will be considering the SEP and whether or not some cha nges are appropriate.", "Bu t until and unless there is some change in the Committee stance on this, I don\u2019t want to identify myself.", "You asked, second, about the San Francisco Fed paper that did point to a notable divergence between market views a nd the views of the Committee.", "I\u2019d say that there have been any number of different analyses of this topic,  there are many different survey measures and interpretations of what the market thinks.", "To the extent that there is a gap, one reason for it could be that ma rkets and participants ha ve different views on the evolution of economic conditions.", "For example, I think I\u2019d note that when the Committee participants write down their forecast for the fede ral funds rate, they are showing the funds rate path that they consider most likely.", "Their ec onomic forecasts are of the conditions that they think are the most likely ones.", "And the path for the funds rate is the path that each individu al thinks is most likely.", "Market participants, understanding that there are a range of po ssible outcomes, with upside and downside possibilities, are doing something slightly differe nt, I think, when they\u2019r e determining market prices.", "They are taking into account the po ssibility that there can be different economic outcomes, including\u2014even if they\u2019re not ve ry likely\u2014ones in which outcomes will be characterized by low inflation or low growth a nd the appropriate path of rates will be low.", "We, you know, want to learn, we\u2014market participants may have different views on the economy than the September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 14 of 22 Committee does, and that\u2019s something we want to try to infer and learn ma rket views, in part from information of this type.", "What I can say is that it is important for market participants to understand what our likely response  or reaction function is to the data, and our job is to try to communicate as clearly as we can the way in which our policy stance will depend on the data, and I promise to try to do that.", "So, I think the Committee would\u2014will be focused on\u2014we intend to use the path of short- term interest rates as our key tool of policy.", "And, of course, market participan ts will be very focused, as we are, on what is the appropriate timing and pace of interest rate increases when  that time comes.", "And I think the Committee would like to feel that it ha s successfully begun the normalization process and that we\u2019re successfully communicating with ma rkets about how that process wi ll be playing out over time.", "And I think when the Committee is comfortable that  that process is established, is working well, and we\u2019re comfortable with the outlook, that they  will begin the process of ceasing\u2014or possibly tapering\u2014but eventually ceasing reinvestments.", "So, we say that it will depend on economic and financial conditions, but we want to make sure normalization is successfu lly under way.", "If we were only to shrink our balance sheet by September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 15 of 22 ceasing reinvestments, it would probably take\u2014to get back to levels of reserve balances that we had before the crisis\u2014I\u2019m not sure we will go that  low, but we\u2019ve said that we will try to shrink our balance sheet to the lowest levels consistent with the efficient and effective implementation of policy\u2014it could take to the end of  the decade to achieve those levels.", "Ah, labor force participation\u2014 BINYAMIN APPELBA", "However, they did indicate that, in the paper, that they see some remaining cyclical shortfall.", "By one technique that they used, th ey placed the estimate at \u00bc percent, but by another technique that they used it could be, I believe they  said, as large as 1 percent.", "And so my own personal view is that there is some cyclical shortfall, and something certainly\u2014probably within that range.", "But nevertheless, it\u2019s  a meaningful cyclical shortfa ll.", "It\u2019s not completely\u2014so I\u2019m giving my own personal view, not a Committee assessment\u2014that, you know, I see the flat\u2014and given the underlying downward trend in labor force particip ation, we might interpret the flattening out of labor force par ticipation over the last year as  showing that that cyclical component has diminished somewhat.", "I think ther e is something that remains, but eventually I would certainly agree with the authors, we  should expect over time to see labor force participation declining.", "Well, you know, we stayed low for a very long time.", "We have been at zero for a very long time and below the leve ls that some common policy rules would now be suggesting, given the level of unemployment and infl ation.", "We\u2019ve also been doing unconventional policies, of course, buying assets.", "And in a general sense, I think we have been lower for longe r than\u2014if you complete that sentence\u2014than many standard policy rules would suggest.", "So, in a sens e, that is a policy that we have had.", "And once we decide it\u2019s appropriate to be gin to normalize policy and to rais e the level of our target for September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 17 of 22 short-term interest rates, it would still take some  time for rates to get back to levels\u2014you can see in our projection that by the end of 2017, the partic ipants are, on average,  projecting that rates will reach the levels they consider normal in the longer run.", "And, similarly, we could make a similar statement with respect to where th e funds rate would stand relative to the recommendations of rules.", "Well, I think it\u2019s very natu ral that the Committee should have a range of opinion about a decision as crucial as what is  the right time to begin to normalize policy, and we do have a range of views in the Committee.", "Presidents Plosser and Fisher have been quite clear in all of their speeches recently in stating that they think the time has come to begin normalizing policy.", "I think they, perhaps, have some concerns that if we don\u2019t begin to do so soon that inflation will pick up above levels we\u2014that they would consider desirable, or that they have some financial stability concerns.", "So there\u2019s been  a little bit of dow ngrading, I think, ev en this time in the longer-run normal growth rates that Committ ee participants have written down.", "You are certainly right in saying that over a number of y ears now, there\u2019s been a pa ttern of forecast errors in which either we\u2019ve been on track with resp ect to unemployment or unemployment has come down in some cases faster than we anticipated, and yet growth has pretty persistently been surprising the Committee to the downside.", "And th at is a statement about  productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing.", "So we have had downward revisions in the level of potential output and to some exte nt, at least for a time, in the pr ojected pace of growth.", "There are a range of views about long-run grow th.", "I think the Committee\u2019s longer-run estimates are neither at the most pessimistic end nor the most optimistic end.", "Well, I mean, you know, certainly we have discussed the outlook for Europe\u2014the very low leve l of inflation that they have seen recently and the decline that they saw in inflationary expectat ions, in the slow pace of growth.", "It is one of a number of risks to the global economy, and we cer tainly hope that they will be successful in seeing the pace of growth and inflation pick up, and I think that will be good for the global economy and the United States.", "So we are c onstantly discussing forward guidance and thinking about whether it\u2019s appropriate and how to revise it.", "And we did do a major overhaul of our forward guidance in March.", "I think the Committee part icipants who have spoken out on this topic recently want to make sure that we have the fl exibility\u2014that the Committee has the flexibility to respond to unfolding developments.", "They want to ma ke sure that if progre ss really does turn out to be faster than we have\u2014we would expect, th at the Committee will be in a position to start sooner tightening monetary policy.", "They do not wa nt to be locked into something that the markets see as a calendar-based and firm commitment.", "And so they want to emphasize data dependence of our policy and make sure that we have appropriate flexibil ity.", "And I\u2019ve said repeat edly, and I want to say again, that if events surprise us, and we\u2019re moving more quickly to ward our objectives, and the Committee sees a need to move sooner or later depending on what th e data is, that we do f eel\u2014I do feel we have the flexibility to move.", "And it is important fo r markets to understand that there is uncertainty, and this statement is not some sort of firm promise about a particular amount of time.", "So on the first question of \u201csome time\u201d before rates return to normal levels, as I mentioned, you can see in the SEP that by the end of 2017, many participants are anticipating that rates will return to what they think ar e normal longer-ru n levels, but the economy, in their view, will have probably gotten back to normal levels of unemployment and near-normal levels of inflation sometime in 2016.", "So that looks like a year or more in which rates would be below normal longer-run levels.", "We asked participants why they hold the view s that they do about appropriate policy, and there are a number of different e xplanations that participants give .", "But a common view on this is that there have been a variety of headwinds resulti ng from the crisis that have slowed growth, led to a sluggish recovery from the crisis, and that  these headwinds will dissipate only slowly, that they are dissipating\u2014an example wo uld be the fact that mortgage credit really is, at this point, available really to those with pristine credit .", "Credit conditions there are abnormally tight.", "September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 21 of 22 Another thing that we se e is that households\u2019 exp ectations about their likely income paths remain quite depressed relative to pre-crisis levels .", "That\u2019s something that may be holding back consumer spending.", "So the view would be that  those forces will dissipate over time, but only very gradually.", "In addition, we have had slow  productivity growth, and a slow pace of potential output likely depresses the pace of investment sp ending.", "So the story is, it\u2019s not that the Fed is behind the curve in fa iling to return the funds rate to normal levels when the economy is recovered.", "It is rather th at, in order to achieve such a recovery in 2016 or by the end, that it\u2019s necessary  and appropriate to have a somewhat more accommodative policy than would be normal in the absence of those headwinds.", "You know, this is somethi ng the Committee is going to have to discuss when the time comes to normalize polic y.", "Looking back on the period, the run-up to the financial crisis, I don\u2019t think, by any means, \u201cm easured pace\u201d and the very predictable pace of 25 basis points per meeting explains why we had a financial crisis, but it  may have diminished volatility and been a small contributing factor, and the Committee will have to think about how to do this.", "I think many people in the aftermath of that episode think that somewhat less of a mechanical pace would perhaps be better, but
