is and how long it \u2019s sustained for.", "So you just have to leave that uncertain.", "And, and we \u2019ll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period , much more about

\u2014but we do have this collection of risks that you mentioned.", "September 20, 2023   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 17 of 28   The, the real point, though, is \u2014the , the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price stability , because the record is clear on that :  If you , you don\u2019 t restore price stability, inflation comes back, and you go through\u2014you  can have a long period where the economy\u2019 s just very uncertain , and it will affect growth ; it will affect all kinds of things.", "It can be a miserable period to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and again.", "So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to rest ore price stability.", "So we fully appreciate

increase in unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles.", "So if I\u2014i f I understood your question, it\u2019s\u2014I would say it this way :  I thin k we knew from the time \u2014from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we lift\u2014we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response.", "In addition, monetary policy was going to help.", "It was going to help supply side heal by, by  cooling demand off and, just in general, September 20, 2023   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 of 28   better aligning supply with demand.", "Well, forecasts are highly uncertain.", "Forecasting is very difficult.", "Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about.", "But to get to, to your question, though\u2014what \u2019s happened is , growth has come in stronger, right ?", "Stronger

because of what we\u2019 ve been seeing in the lab or market.", "We \u2019ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing significantly higher unemployment.", "So we\u2019re, we \u2019re continuing that trend.", "In terms of inflation, you, you are seeing\u2014 the last three readings are , are very good readings.", "But if you look at June, July, and August, you\u2019 re

inflation, of course, has come way September 20, 2023   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 28   down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing.", "So I think \u2014people should know t hat, that  economic forecasting is very difficult, and these are highly uncertain forecasts.", "But these are \u2014these are our forecasts.", "You know, they\u2019re, they\u2019re \u2014we have very high- quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other forecasters.", "But just the nature of the business is , the economy is very difficult to forecast.", "Well, I , I think we have come very far very fast in , in the , the rate increases that we\u2019 ve made.", "And , and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think

risk of , of undertightening becomes more equal.", "So we\u2019re, we \u2019re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more carefully now as we\u2014as we sort of find

affect that meeting.", "I mean, if you \u2019re looking \u2014if\u2014we, we can tell how much inflation has gone up in a given month, right?", "And, you know, I think \u2014I think what we \u2019re really looking at is , there \u2019s a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but they\u2019 re incredibly volatile , and they can be misleading.", "That \u2019s why we look at 12- month [rates] .", "September 20, 2023   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 21 of 28   But I think , in this situation \u2014where it looks like we \u2019ve had a bit of a turn in

longer periods.", "So, you know, energy prices are very important for the consumer.", "This, this  can affect consumer spending.", "It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.", "I mean, gas prices are one of the big things that , that  affects consumer sentiment.", "It , it really comes down to how persistent \u2014how sustained these energy prices are.", "The reason why we look at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that.", "And it doesn\u2019t\u2014energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don\u2019 t contain much of a signal about how tight the economy is, and hence don \u2019t tell you much about where inflation\u2019 s really going.", "However, we \u2019re well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high, that\u2019ll have an effect on spending.", "And , and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations of infl ation \u2014things like that.", "So , to, to finish my prior thought, I was
