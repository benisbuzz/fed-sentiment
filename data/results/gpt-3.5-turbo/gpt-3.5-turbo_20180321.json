expansion and a strong labor market.", "In the Committee\u2019s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals.", "By contrast, raising rates too slowly  would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion.", "At the same time, we want to avoid inflation running persistently

you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will.", "So, you know, on the one hand, the risk would be that we wait too March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 5

economy is broadly on this path.", "You know, so as you noted, the \u2014what we \u2019ve said in the longer -run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below.", "And, I think it \u2019s\u2014I wouldn\u2019 t characterize what we \u2019ve done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation.", "We were always pushing toward 2 percent , and I think that is how we look at it.", "It just is that we \u2019re always going to be seeking 2 percent March 21, 2018

to balance that against the deviation of employment from \u2014unemployment from its goal.", "So the Summary of Economic Projections  is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts.", "The C ommittee made really  one decision at this meeting, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.", "The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written down.", "And, you \u2019ve identified the median as 2.7 percent .", "I would\u2014and that \u2019s an interesting statistic .", "I would also say that the central tendency is interesting.", "The full range is interesting.", "One of the great benefits of our system is that we do have R eserve Banks with their own s taffs and Governors with different views , and so we discuss these things.", "You know, I would say it \u2019s hard to say, but it would take \u2014you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long -run growth.", "It March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 7 of 22  would take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to get there.", "So I guess I \u2019d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.", "And also, I think we all understand that any point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands .", "So as the \u2014as the actual unemployment rate has declined  from 10 perce nt to 4.1 percent , the Committee \u2019s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point.", "So the Committee \u2014and , I think, people \u2014are generally influenced by data.", "As they see unemployment going lower, they \u2019re loo king at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation.", "So I don\u2019 t think we, we \u2014we \u2019re mindful of the uncertainty of that, and we \u2019ll be looking at that.", "So, as \u2014if inflation \u2014if unemployment does continue to go down, we \u2019ll continue to do that.", "As I mentioned earlier, there is no \u2014there\u2019 s no sense in the data that we \u2019re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation.", "We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that.", "I guess the idea \u2014the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 8 of 22  period, you would see an acceleration of inflation.", "Longer -run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow -moving forces over time.", "So I wouldn\u2019 t expect the Committee \u2019s, you know, predictions or projections or estimates of those values to move quickly.", "So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would move up because of, for example, greater fiscal expan sion?", "But it\u2019 s\u2014I think, generally speaking, the Committee  sees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not\u2014is not seeing it as having moved up and is open to the possibility that it will.", "I would want to think very carefully about it and make sure that no one would take more March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 9 of 22  frequent press conferences as a signal of the path of policy.", "So, in terms of the balance sheet, we \u2019ve said that , you know, we carefully developed this plan .", "We carefully socialized it in a series of meetings last year.", "We announced it, and we said we wouldn\u2019 t change it , really , unless there were a significant downturn that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates.", "We \u2019re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our policy.", "So, on the second question, on tariffs, a number of participants in this FOMC did bring up the is sue of tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that , it was, first, that there \u2019s no thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook.", "Second thing is, I would say , is that a number of participants rep orted in \u2014about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern going forward for that group.", "So fiscal stimulus is a, y ou know, a meaningful input into, you know, into the SEP and particularly in the changes over the course of last year and this year.", "And individual policymakers went through, with their staffs, a range of estimates, a range of literature, and did their ow n thinking and came up with their own estimates and submitted those as their Summary of Economic Projections \u2014as their projections.", "I would go back to the thought that, you know, we made one decision at this meeting , and that decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25  basis points.", "The projections are really just individual projections t hat ar e submitted and then compiled.", "And, you know, you \u2019re mentioning the median as being, you know, three and four being close , but, you know, I think, like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time, and they \u2019ll change depending on the way the outlook for th e economy changes.", "I wouldn\u2019 t want to \u2014for now, these are the best forecasts that people could make , and, you know, it could be that if the economy \u2019s a little bit stronger or a li ttle bit weaker, then the path could be a little less gradual or a little more gradual.", "You know, for trade, what I mentioned is that our FOMC participants reported in that they had heard, you know, concerns , which were relatively new , about \u2014about  future trade actions, really.", "And they \u2019re seeing it as a risk -to-the-outlook kind of thing.", "In terms of productivity \u2014productivity, as I \u2019m sure you know, has been very weak  since the financial crisis.", "It\u2019s averaged only about 0.5 percent a year for the last six years , I guess.", "So that\u2019s well below, you know, longer -run averages, and it would certainly be a good thing to see it move up.", "And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity.", "I think in the tax bill there\u2019s \u2014there are incentives for \u2014there\u2014 a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional i nvestment that should encourage productivity.", "In theory, an individual tax bill that lowers tax rates should encourage more labor force participation.", "So I do think it \u2019s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country.", "It\u2019s not something that we can really do at the Fed , but, you know, we \u2019re certainly hopeful that there will be supply -side effects like that from the tax bill.", "I think estimates are really all over the place in terms of the amount and the timing of those.", "You know, I would say that \u2014remember that forecasts  three years out \u2014so, you\u2019 re righ t, in 2020 there \u2019s a\u2014I think it\u2019s 3.4 percent  is the median of the SEP dots for 2020, which is 40 basis points above the estimates of the neutral rate, which I would characterize as, you know, modestly restrictive, modestly  tightening policy, but that\u2019 s three years in the future.", "It\u2019s highly uncertain.", "You know, we \u2019ve been throug h many years of growth around 2 percent , and I \u2019ve given a number of public remarks where I \u2019ve called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, wh ich drive potential growth.", "So, you know, I think it \u2019s really important that we do something \u2014do what we can as a country to increase our  potential growth rate.", "I would say in the bill that passed Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs A ct, there were elements t hat should encourag e productivity, as I mentioned\u2014sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor force participation.", "I think , as you look around the table at the FOMC, there \u2019s a wide range of views on the amount and the timing of those.", "Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is wor king very well.", "We have excellent contro l over rates, and it \u2019s working.", "And it\u2019s\u2014you described it accurately.", "We haven \u2019t made a deci sion to keep that as our longer -run framework.", "We \u2019ve had meetings where we\u2019 ve talked about it, and we \u2019ve agre ed that it\u2019 s working well.", "For example, one \u2014in the long -run, the size of the balance sheet  is going to depend on the public \u2019s demand for our liabilities , including currency and reserves.", "So we don\u2019 t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have \u2014you know, you have regulations that require banks to hold lot s of high- quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those.", "So it \u2019s not something we \u2019re looking at resolving in the near  term.", "March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 15 of 22  You mentioned the question of interest on excess reserves, and I think it \u2019s a little bit of a misnomer to think that there \u2019s a subsidy there.", "We pay interest on excess reserves.", "We can \u2019t pay interest on excess reserves that are \u2014is above the general level of short -term interest rates.", "So we \u2019re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other \u2014any other investment in the short -term money markets.", "The assets that we have on the other side are T reasury securities and mortgage -backed securities , which yield much higher than interest on reserves.", "Since the financial crisis, we\u2019 ve been monitoring financial conditions and financial stability issues very carefully, and the FOMC receives regular briefings about the staff framework and , sort of , measures of various aspects of financial \u2014financial  stability risks, and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, let \u2019s say .", "So, if you look at the banking system, particularly the large financial institutions, you see higher capital.", "You see much higher liquidity.", "You see them more aware of their risks and better able to m anage them with stress testing.", "You don\u2019 t see excess risk -taking in great quantity the way you did s ee March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 16 of 22  before the crisis.", "If you look at households, household balance sheets are in much better condition.", "If you look at nonf inancial corporations, you see \u2014you do see relatively elevated levels of borrowing, but nothing that suggests, you know, serious risks.", "And, of course, default rates are very low.", "I should mention also that for large financia l institutions, they \u2019re no longer funded by a lot of short -term wholesale funding, which can disappear very quickly , so they \u2019re far less vulnerable to liquidity issues.", "You identified t he\u2014really, one area where\u2014which is an area of focus , which is asset prices.", "So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer -run historical norms.", "You can think of some equity prices.", "You can think of commercial real estate prices i n certain markets.", "But  we don\u2019 t see it in housing, which is key.", "And so, overall, if you put all of that into a pie, what you have is moderate vulnerabilities , in our view.", "In terms of whether we have the tools, you know, we have some tools, and I think we ce rtainly \u2014we use them.", "We have\u2014 I think the stress test is a really important tool that we have for the largest financial institutions and for the smaller financial institutions.", "We regularly use that to \u2014as a way to test against various, you know, mar ket shocks, c ertainly for the larger institutions.", "It\u2019s not something \u2014so Congress is looking at raising the threshold for applying enhanced financial standards to\u2014f rom $50 billion to $250 billion, while leaving us with the ability to reach below $250 billion and apply those standards where we think it \u2019s appropriate.", "So, you know, we \u2014regular  way c ommercial banks that  do deposit  taking and lending and don\u2019 t specu late in markets, y ou know, that \u2019s one business model.", "Another business model might be, you know, if you think of a hedge fund, right?", "They \u2019re speculating on markets, and\u2014 you know, so ver y different business models and different levels of risk and that sort of thing.", "I mean, there March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 18 of 22  would be a range of things, you know \u2014how well capitalized is the institution, but mainly those things.", "Remember that there ar e 15 FOMC participants, and we \u2014each of us has his or her own forecast.", "So there \u2019s a real diversity of views on this, pa rticularly on these fiscal issues.", "If I could try to summarize, it woul d be that , I think, broadly speaking , participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next, let \u2019s say, three years.", "I think there \u2019s a general view as well that supply -side issues\u2014that there could  be supply -side effects as well, and  you would see that again through higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment , which would drive \u2014tend to drive productivity over time.", "If you make investment more attractive, companies should do more  of it.", "It\u2019s uncertain, though.", "I mean, I spent many years of my life working with companies and discussing\u2014and , you know, the cost of capital is one  of many factors that they \u2019ll consider.", "It isn \u2019t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity.", "At the same time, the \u2014you know, I mentioned labor supply.", "You should see some labor  supply effects over time from lower individual effective tax rates.", "The whole thing is very March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 19 of 22  uncertain, and particularly the supply -side effects should and would be expected to take longer to appear and would be less certain in amount.", "We \u2019ve discussed it with our in -house experts and come up with our own views, a nd they \u2019re disparate, but that \u2019s\u2014I\u2019d say that \u2019s about where the \u2014where the views are.", "You know, at this stage, what our FOMC participants discussed \u2014it wasn \u2019t\u2014it was \u2014it was just that this is a new risk that had been probably a low -profile risk ,

in wages.", "So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases.", "You should get paid for yo ur productivity plus inflation .", "And productivity \u2019s been very low.", "Inflation \u2019s been low.", "So these low wage increases \u2014in a sen se, they do make sense in that \u2014from that perspective.", "On the other hand, as the market ha s
