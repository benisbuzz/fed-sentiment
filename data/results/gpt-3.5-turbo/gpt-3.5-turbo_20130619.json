["The Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two -day meeting earlier today.", "Based on its review of recent economic and financial developments, the Committee sees the economy continuing to grow at a moderate pace, notwithstanding the strong headwinds created by current federal fiscal policies.", "The labor market has continued to improve, with gains in private payroll employment averaging about 200,000 jobs per month over the past six months.", "Job gains, along with the strengthening housing market, have in turn contributed to increases in consumer confidence and supported household spending.", "However, at 7.6 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated, as do rates of underemployment and long -term unemployment.", "Overall, the Committee believes the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market have diminished since the fall, but we will continue to evaluate economic conditions and risks as they evolve.", "Inflation has been running below the Committee \u2019s longer -run objective of 2 percent for some time and has been a bit softer recently.", "The Committee believes that the recent softness partly reflects transitory factors , and with longer -term inflation expectations remaining stable, the Committee expects inflation to move back towards  this 2 percent longer -term objective over time.", "We will, however, be closely monitori ng these developments as well.", "In conjunction with this meeting, the 19 participants in our policy discussion\u2014the 7 Board members and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents \u2014submitted individual economic projections.", "As always, each participant \u2019s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.", "Generally, the projections of individual participants show they expect moderate growth, picking up over time, and gradual progress towards  levels of June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  2 of 28   unemployment and infl ation consistent with the Federal Reserve \u2019s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.", "In brief , participants \u2019 projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.3 to 2.6 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.6 percent i n 2015.", "The central tendency of their projections of the unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of this year is 7.2 to 7.3 percent, declining to 5.8 to 6.2 percent in the final quarter of 2015.", "Most participants see inflation gradually increasing from its current low level toward the Committee \u2019s longer -run objective; the central tendency of their projections for inflation is 0.8 to 1.2 perce nt for this year and 1.6 to 2.0 percent for 2015.", "Before turning to today \u2019s policy decision, let me say a few wo rds about the Federal Reserve\u2019 s strategy for normalizing policy in the long run .", "In the minutes of its June 2011 meeting, the Committee set forth principles that it intended to follow when the time came to normalize policy and the size and the structure of the Federal Reserve \u2019s balance sheet .", "As part of prudent planning, we have been reviewing these principles in recent meetings .", "While participants continue to think that, in the long run, the Federal Reserve \u2019s portfolio should consist predom inantly of Treasury securities, a strong majority now expects that the Committee will not sell agency mortgage -backed securities during the process of normalizing monetary policy, although in the longer run, limited sales could be used to reduce or elimina te residual MBS holdings .", "I emphasize that, given the outlook and the Committee \u2019s policy guidance, these matters are unlikely to be relevant to actual policy for quite a while .", "June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  3 of 28   Let me turn now to current policy issues .", "With unemployment still elevated and inflation below the Committee \u2019s longer -run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies .", "As you know, in normal times, the Committee eases monetary policy by lowering the target for the short -term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate.", "However, the target range for the federal funds rate, currently at 0 to \u00bc percent, cannot meaningfully be reduced further .", "Thus, we are providing policy accommodation through two alternative methods :  first, by communicating to the public the Committee \u2019s plans for setting the federal funds rate target over the medium term, and , second , by purchasing and holding Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities .", "Let me discuss a few key points regarding each of these two policy  tools .", "First, today the Committee reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6\u00bd percent so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the senses described in the FOMC statement .", "As I have noted frequently, the phrase \u201c at least as long\u201d in the Committee \u2019s interest rate guidance is important.", "T he economic conditions we have set out as preceding any future rate i ncrease are thresholds, not triggers .", "For example, assuming that inflation is near our objective at that time, as expected, a decline in the unemployment rate to 6\u00bd percent would not lead automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but rather would indicate only that it was appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase .", "All else equal, the more subdued the outlook for inflation at that time, the more patient the Committee would  likely be in making that assessment .", "In the projections submitted for this meeting, 14 of 19 FOMC participants indicated that they expect the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate to occur in 2015, and one June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  4 of 28   expected the first increase to  incur in 2016.", "Moreover, so long as the economy remains short of maximum employment, inflation remains near our longer -run objective, and inflation expectations remain well  anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they begin, ar e likely to be gradual, consistent with the Committee \u2019s balanced approach to meeting its employment and price stability objectives .", "The purpose of this forward guidance about policy is to assure households and businesses that monetary policy will continu e to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job creation picks up.", "Importantly, as our statement notes, the Committee expects a considerable interval of time to pass between when the Committee will cease adding accommodation through asset purchases and the time when the Committee will begin to reduce accommodation by moving the federal funds rate target toward more normal levels .", "The second policy tool being employed by the Committee is asset purchases .", "Specifically, the Committee has been purchasing $40 billion per month in agency mortgage -backed securities and $45 billion per month in Treasury securities .", "When our program of asset purchases was initiated last September, the Committee stated the goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the  context of price stability and noted it would also be taking appropriate account of the efficacy and costs of the program .", "Today the Committee made no changes to the purchase program .", "Although the Comm ittee left the pace of purchases unchanged at today \u2019s meeting, it has stated that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve .", "Any such change would reflect the incoming data and their implications for the outlook, as well as the cumul ative progress made toward the Committee \u2019s objectives since the program began in September .", "Going forward, the economic outcomes that the Committee sees as most likely involve continuing gains June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  5 of 28   in labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the near -term restraint from fiscal policy and other headwinds diminishes .", "We also see inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time .", "If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this forecast, the Co mmittee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year .", "And if the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around midyear .", "In this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains, a substantial improvement from the 8.1 percent unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee announced this program .", "I would like to emphasize once more the point that our policy is in no way predetermined and will  depend on the incoming data and the evolution of the outlook as well as on the cumulative progress toward our objectives .", "If conditions improve faster than expected, the pace of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly .", "If the outlook becomes less favorable, on the other hand, or if financial conditions are judged to be inconsistent with further progress in the labor markets, reductions in the pace of purchases could be delayed.", "Indeed, should it be needed, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase in the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability .", "It\u2019s also worth noting here that, even if a modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases occurs, we would not be shrinking the Federal Reserve \u2019s portfolio of securities , but only slowing the pace at which we are adding to the portfolio while continuing to reinvest principal payments June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  6 of 28   and proceeds from maturing holdings as well .", "These large and  growing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates .", "To use the analogy of driving an automobile, any slowing in the pace of purchases will be akin to letting up a bit on the gas pedal as the car picks up speed, not to beginning to apply the brakes .", "I will close by drawing again the important distinction between the Committee \u2019s decisions about adjusting the pace of asset purchases and its forward guidance regarding the target for the federal funds rate.", "As I mentioned, the current level of the federal funds rate target is likely to remain appropriate for a considerable period after asset purchases are concluded .", "To return to the driving analogy, if the incoming data support the view that the economy is able to sustain a reasonable cruising speed, we will ease the pressure on the accelerator by gradually reducing the pace of purchases .", "However, any need to consider applying the brakes by raising short -term rates is still far in the future .", "In any case, no matter how conditions may evolve, the Federal Reserve remains committed to fostering substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.", "That is \u2014we had a good discussion of that issue today , and we haven \u2019t had \u2014obviously , there\u2019 s no change, there\u2019 s no change in policy involved here, there \u2019s simply a clarification, helping people to think about where polic y will evolve .", "Future policy June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  7 of 28   statements may include elements of this , but it \u2019s not a policy change .", "I\u2019m just trying to explain how are \u2014how we \u2019re making a  substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market , how we\u2019re making that concrete , and how we \u2019re thinking about the potential future of the program given alternative policy and economic developments.", "It represents the consensus of the FOMC, yes.", "Well, there  are many factors that we look at when t rying to judge the state of the labor market .", "As you know, we look at participation, payrolls, a variety of other data , but the 7 percent unemployment rate is indicative of the kind of progress we \u2019d like to make in order to be able to say  that we \u2019ve reach ed substantial progress.", "Well, the fundamentals look a little better to us .", "In particular, the housing sector, which has been a drag on growth since the crisis , is now, obviously, a support to growth.", "It\u2019s not only creating construction jobs, but as house prices rise, increased household wealth supports consumption spending, consumer sentiment .", "State and local governments , who have been a major drag , are now coming to a position where they no longer have to lay off large numbers of workers .", "Generally speaking, financial conditions are improving .", "The main drag , or the main headwind , to growth this year is , as you know, is the federal fiscal policy, which the CBO estimates is something on the order of 1 \u00bd percentage points of growth.", "And our judgment is that, you know, given that very heavy headwind, the fact that the economy is still moving ahead at at least a  moderate pace, is indicative that the underlying factors are improving .", "Obviously, we haven\u2019 t seen the full effect yet of the fiscal policy changes ; we\u2019ll  want to see how that evolves as we get through that fiscal impact .", "But we \u2019re hopeful, as you can see from the individual projections \u2014and again, these are individual projections, not an official forecast of the C ommittee \u2014we \u2019ll be obviously very interested to see if the economy does pick up a bit and continue to reduce unemployment, as we anticipate.", "I think one thing that \u2019s very important for me to say is that, if you draw the conclusion that I \u2019ve just said , that our policies \u2014that our purchases will end in the middle of next year, you \u2019ve drawn the wrong conclus ion because our purchases are tied to what happens in the economy .", "And if the Federal Reserve makes the same error and we overestimate what \u2019s happening, then our policies will adjust to that .", "We are not \u2014we have no deterministic or fixed plan.", "Yes, rates have come up some .", "That \u2019s in part due to more optimism , I think , about the economy .", "It\u2019s  in part due to perceptions of the Federal Reserve.", "The forecast \u2014the projections that our participants submitted for this meeting , of course , were done in the last few days , so they were done with full knowledge of what had happened to financial conditions .", "Rates have tightened some, but, you know, other factors ha ve been more positive \u2014increasing house prices , for example .", "I think as far as the housing market is concerned, we \u2019re going to want to watch that , but one important difference now is that people are more optimistic about housing .", "They expect house prices to continue to rise , and we see that , for example, in a survey question in the Michigan survey .", "And that, you know, compensates to some extent for a slightly higher mortgage rate .", "And , in fact, in terms of monthly payments on an average house, the change in mortgage rates we \u2019ve seen so far is not all that dramatic .", "So, yes, our forecast \u2014our projections do factor that in, and if interest rates go up for the right rea sons\u2014that is , both optimism about the economy and an accurate assessment of monetary policy \u2014that \u2019s a good thing .", "It was bigger than can be explained I think by changes in the ultimate stock of asset purchases within reasonable ranges .", "So I think we have to conclude that there are other factors at work as well , including , again, some optimism about the economy, maybe some uncertainty arising .", "So, I \u2019m agreeing with you that it seems larger than can be explained by a changing view of monetary policy .", "It\u2019s difficult to judge whether the markets are in sync or not .", "Generally speaking though, I think that what I \u2019ve seen from analyst s and market participants is not wildly different from what, you know, the C ommittee is thinking and trying to\u2014as I try today  to communicate .", "I think the most important thing that I just want to convey , again , is that it\u2019 s important not to say \u201c this date, that date, this time, \u201d it\u2019s important to understand that our policies are economic dependent and, in particular , if financial conditions move in a way that make this economic scenario unlikely , for example, then that would be a reason for us to adjust our policy .", "Well, Ylan, we just spent two days working on monetary policy issues , and I would like to keep the debate, discussion, the  questions here on policy .", "Well, it\u2019 s a great question and \u2014but the \u2014what you pointed out, the difference between the little dots and the forecast actually illustrates the point, which is , remember, the 6\u00bd percent is a threshold, not a trigger .", "In other words, when we get to that point, we will then at that point begin to, you know, look at whether an increase in rates is appropriate , and among the things we would take into account , first of all , is inflation, and infla tion obviously is very low and expected to stay low .", "Secondly, we would be taking into account , does that unemployment rate fairly represent in some sense the state of the labor market ?", "And, as you pointed out, we have underemployment , part -time work, pe ople leaving the labor force, reduced participation, long- term unemployment, a number of factors which suggest that maybe th e 6.5 percent is a little bit\u2014not exactly representative of the state of the labor market at that point .", "June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  12 of 28   So, first of all, since it is a threshold and not a trigger, we \u2019re entirely free to take all that into account before we begin the process of raising rates , and that \u2019s what the diagram suggests .", "People are saying that unemployment will be at 6.5 in late 2014 or  early 2015, but the y\u2019re saying that increases  in rates may not follow but several quarters after that .", "In terms of adjusting the threshold, I think that \u2019s something that might happen .", "If it did happen, it would be to lower it, I\u2019m sure , not to raise it.", "I think going from 8.1 percent and a stagnant rate of improvement to 7 percent and stronger economic growth is a substantial increase.", "One of them is rate policy , and that includes both setting the rate and providing guidance about future rates .", "That \u2019s our basic tool, that \u2019s the one that the Federal Reserve and other central banks h ave used forever .", "Asset purchases are a different kind of thing .", "They \u2019re unconventional policy, they come with certain risks and certain uncertainties that are not necessarily associated with rate policy .", "So our intent from the beginning , as I\u2019ve been very clear , June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  13 of 28   was to use asset purchases as a way of achieving some near -term momentum to get the economy moving forward into a sustainable recovery .", "And then, essentially , to allow the low interest rate policy which\u2014to carry us through.", "The first is, our target is not 7, it \u2019s not 6\u00bd, our target is maximum employment, which , according to our projections , most people on the C ommittee think is somewhere between 5 and 6 percent unemployment , and that \u2019s where we\u2019 re trying to get to .", "So, the other thing I wanted to say was that stopping asset purchases, when that happens , and I think we \u2019re still some distance from that happening , but when that happens, that won\u2019 t involve ending the stimulus from asset purchases because we\u2019 re going to hold on t o that portfolio.", "And if the  stock theory of the portfolio is correct , which we believe it is, holding all of  those securities off of the market and reinvesting and still keeping the , you know, rolling -over maturing securities, w ill still continue to put downward  pressure on interest rates .", "And so, between our commitments to a low federal funds rate and  the large portfolio, we will still be producing a very large amount of stimulus \u2014in our view , enough to bring the economy smoothly towards full employment without incurring unnecessary costs or risks.", "There are a number of, as I mentioned in th e statement, there are a num ber of transitory factors that may be contributing to the very low inflation rate .", "For example, the effects of the sequester on medical payments, the fact that nonmarket prices are extraordinarily low right now .", "So these are some things that we expect to  reverse and we expect to see inflation come up a bit .", "But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation -adjusted \u2014inflation -index ed bonds have come down.", "And moreover, other measures of inflation expectations , be it forecast s by professional forecasters, whether it \u2019s survey measures from firms or households, those are all still pretty much in the same places they we re.", "Now that being said, and as I said in my opening remarks, we don \u2019t take anything for granted .", "And one of the preconditions for the policy path that I described is that inflation begin , at least gradually , to return towards our 2 percent objective .", "And we are certainly determined to keep inflation not only \u2014we want to keep inflation near its objective , not only avoiding inflation that \u2019s too high, but we also want to avoid inflation that \u2019s too low.", "It\u2019s particularly important when we have an unusual economic situation where I think the standard relationships are not  applying in the way they have , where we \u2019re using unconventional tools, where we\u2019 re using forward guidance .", "We hope that the \u2014again, the key point I \u2019ve tried to make today is that our policies are tied to how the outlook evolves .", "And that should provide some comfort to markets because they will understand, I hope, that we will be providing whatever support is necessary .", "If the economy does not improve along the lines that we expect, we\u2019 ll provide additional support .", "If financial conditions evolve in a way that \u2019s inconsistent with economic recovery, we will provide support .", "But we \u2019re hope \u2014and in that way, we hope to increase confidence both among market participants , but also among investors and private consumers and other people in the economy .", "So, but again, I mean, your point is well  taken that we are in a position where the simple adjustment by 25 bas is points to the federal funds rate seems like a long-ago exper ience, and we are in a more complex type of situation .", "But we are determined to be as clear as we can , and we hope that you and your listeners and the markets will all be able to follow what we \u2019re saying.", "The Volcker r ule, for example, involves some very subtle distinctions between hedging and market ma king and proprietary trading .", "The second reason is that many of them involve multiple agencies , which have to coordinate, cooperate , and agree on language .", "I think it\u2019s a little unfair to say, \u201cWell, only 30 percent of the rules have been completed,\u201d  because most of the rules , even if they haven \u2019t been completed , are now very far advanced , and that \u2019s true for the major rules .", "It\u2019s a conference sponsored by one of the 12 R eserve Banks.", "Every one of the 12 R eserve Banks has conferences, has meetings, and this is the one I \u2019ve gone to the most of probably any of the R eserve Banks, so I think it \u2019s not inappropriate to go to different conferences, different meetings , and to essentially meet all the constituents that I have in these different R eserve Banks.", "Well, I certainly hope the unemployment rate comes down so fast  that this becomes a problem .", "One is that , of course, you know, there \u2019s a range of estimates , and they \u2019re all based on each individual \u2019s idea of optimal policy , so the policy assumptions may not be the same .", "So, evidently , if you, you know, look at the policy expectations that are given in the dot diagram, you\u2019 ll see that the very strong majority of FOMC participants still expect rates to be quite low at the end of 2015.", "So that \u2019s not inconsistent, that \u2019s just saying that people are looking at a variety o f factors , including inflation , which is predicted to be quite low, and other perhaps labor market factors in  thinking about when it \u2019ll be appropriate to start increasing rates.", "Well, we are still only a fraction of the total holdings of mortgage -backed securities , but, more relevant , as part of our assessment \u2014of our ongoing assessment of the potential cost s of our various  asset purchase programs , we pay very close attention to market functioning .", "And our assessment is that the MBS market is still quite a healthy market in terms of the spreads, in terms of execut ion times, in terms of the number of people on both sides of the market .", "The re are plenty of real -money investors holding M", "There are some\u2014 a number of bills in Congress which would change the GSEs, would eliminate them in some cases , or would place them with backstop government support, as  opposed to 100 percent government credit guarantees .", "mortgage market .", "I think it \u2019s entirely possible that if there \u2019s major change in the government \u2019s role in the mortgage market that we might see a different structure in mortgages .", "And, you know, other countries have different structures , and they have , in many cases , the same or similar home ownership rates as we do, s o it\u2019s possible that we may find that a different structure is better for s ome people .", "Well, as I tr ied to explain in my opening remarks, our pla ns depend on the economic scenario and how it evolves .", "And what I tr ied to do is explain how our asset purchases would evolve if , sort of , the modal, the most likely forecast , were to , in fact , take place, which , of cou rse, it won \u2019t exactly take place, s omething else will no doubt  happen.", "But again, our basic forecast is one which is basically , as was pointed out earlier by Mr. Hilsenrath, a moderately optimistic forecast, where growth picks  up as we pass through this period of fiscal restraint; where un employment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last September \u2014and we have made som e progress since last September ; and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent .", "Those are the conditions that define this sort of baseline forecast .", "In that case then, as I described it, we would expect probably to slow or moderate purchases some time later this year, and then through the middle of \u2014through  the early part of next year , and ending , in that scenario , somewhere in  the middle of the year .", "Aga in though, it \u2019s very important to understand that that\u2019 s\u2014if we do that, that would basically say that , you know , that we \u2019ve had a relatively decent economic outcome in terms of sustained improvement in growth and unemployment .", "I think I would\u2014to answer your other question\u2014 I would draw the analogy:  If the Federal Reserve in normal times lowers the federal funds rate by 25 basis points , but some traders think that \u2014were  expecting 50 basis points, then there might be a sense that the financial conditions have tightened somewhat .", "But nevertheless, I think you would say that if the Fed cut the funds rate by 25 basis points , that that was an easing of policy .", "And, by the same t oken, as June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  22 of 28   long as we \u2019re buying assets , we are adding to our holdings .", "We do believe \u2014although, you know, there \u2019s room for debate \u2014we do believe that the primary effect of our purchases is through the stock that we hold, because that stock has been withdrawn from markets , and the prices of those assets have to adju st to balance supply and demand.", "A nd we \u2019ve taken out some of the supply , and so the prices go up, the yields go down.", "I think low \u2014inflation that\u2019 s too low is a problem .", "It increases the risk of deflation .", "It raises real interest rates .", "It means that debt de leveraging takes place more slowly .", "And , as I pointed out, there are a few reasons that are probably not that meaningful economically \u2014for example, the temporary movement in medical prices, the temporary movements in nonmarket prices, thi ngs of that sort .", "I mean, after all , the CPI is somewhat higher .", "And so we expect inflation to come back up, that \u2019s our forecast .", "W e would like to get inflation up to our target , and that will be a factor in our thinking about the thresholds .", "It will be a factor in our thinking about asset purchases .", "And, you know, we \u2019ve got a dual mandate, and it \u2019s maximum employment and price stability .", "And there\u2019 s a reason why we define price stability as a positive inflation rate, not zero, because we believe that in order to best maximize the mandate, we need to have enough inflation so that there is , in fact, you know, some room for real interest rates to move .", "Well, when we \u2014as I recall, I believe I have this right \u2014when we introduced the second round of LSAPs , properly known as QE2, in , I think, November 2010, there was a lot of increase in commodity prices at that time , and there was a lot of complaining that the Fed is pumping up commodity prices , and that that \u2019s a negative for people around the world.", "And we argued at the time that the effect s of the Federal Reserve\u2019 s policy on global commodity prices was probably pr etty small , and that it operated \u2014to the extent it did have an effect \u2014it operated through growth\u2014mos tly through growth expectations .", "That is , a stronger global economy tends to dri ve up commodity prices .", "This time around, we \u2019ve purchased , and are in the process of purchasi ng, a lot more than we did in so- called QE2 .", "We haven \u2019t really seen much increase in commodity prices .", "Commodity prices are way off their peaks of early last year.", "But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets \u2014China, the rest of Asia , and some other parts of the worl d\u2014plus Europe , of course , are softer , and so global commodity demand is weaker .", "And that explains , I think, the bulk of why commodity prices have not risen so much.", "So I think that \u2019s all consistent with our story that the effect of asset purchases on com modity prices \u2014I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s  zero, but I don \u2019t think that it\u2019 s nearly as bi g as some folks have suggested.", "In terms of wages, I think that \u2019s mostly consistent with our view that unemployment , at 7.6 percent , is still pretty far from where we should be satisfied .", "Maximum employment, we think, is , again , between 5 and 6 percent , although these are very difficult numbers to estimate .", "June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  25 of 28   So, very weak wage growth, except in a few places and a few narrow occupation s, is
