significant uncertainty about  the\u2014both the path and the ultimate destination of any further rate increases.", "If you go b ack some years, I think we\u2014 people who were working at the Fed in 2013 and \u201914 t ook away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive to news about the size of the balance sheet, the pace of asset purchases, the pace of runoff, and things like that.", "So we thought carefully about this, on how t o normalize policy, and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on  automatic pilot and use monetary policy, rate policy, t o adjust to incoming data.", "I think that the ru noff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose.", "And I do think that we will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate p olicy, as the active tool of monetary policy.", "So, as background, I would just point to 2018  being a very strong year and the Committee looking forward to 2019 and still  having what amounts to a positive forecast.", "We still are forecasting, individually, gro wth a bit above its longer-run potential\u20142.3 percent is what we\u2019re forecasting.", "We\u2019re forecas ting that growth will be strong enough that unemployment will drop  still further and inflation will remain right near our target.", "So I\u2019d say that\u2019s a reasonably positive forecast.", "Going forward, you know, I will be l ooking, in particular, to see whether incoming data tell us that we\u2019re, in fact, on tha t path, that development of the economy is in line with that expectation.", "I think, from this point forward, we\u2019re going to be l etting the data speak to us a nd form the outlook and inform our understanding of what would be a ppropriate policy.", "So there\u2019s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path a nd the ultimate destination of  any further increases.", "So, as I menti oned, we monitor a broad range of economic conditions, including financial c onditions\u2014a broad range of financial conditions.", "And we took on board the tightening in financial conditions, which\u2014not any one condition, but, broadly speaking, financial conditions have tightened since the September meeting, really.", "So we took that on board in our forecast.", "Tha t\u2019s why the forecast for gro wth and inflation went down a little Page 7 of 22

statement language, we acknowledge d those risks in the clause a bout monitoring developments.", "I think, more broadly, there\u2019s been a sense of concern among business people and market people about global growt h, and, you know, that may be partly about trade tensions, it may be partly about a variety of things .", "If you just mechanically dro p into a model of the U.S. economy tariffs,

nonpolitical way.", "Well, we\u2014as a Committee, we do not desire inf lation undershoots.", "I think we\u2019re very clo se to 2 percent, and, you know, we do believe it\u2019s a symmetric goal for us.", "Inflation is symmetric around 2 percent, and that \u2019s how we\u2019re going to look at it.", "We\u2019re trying to be sym metrically around 2 percent.", "And I don\u2019t\u2014you know, I\u2019ve never said t hat I feel like we\u2019ve achiev ed that goal yet.", "The only way to achieve inflation symmetricall y around 2 percent is to have inflation symmetrically around 2 percent, and we\u2019ve been close t o that but we haven\u2019t gotten t here yet, and we have not declared victory on that.", "If you look at 2018, as I mentioned, this the best year since the financial  crisis.", "You\u2019ve had growth well above trend.", "You\u2019ve got inflation moving up to 2 percent.", "And we also have a positive forecast, as I mentioned, and, in t hat context, we think this

ask whether our strategy and our tools and our communications around monetary p olicy are doing the job that Congress has assigned us to do on be half of the American people .", "And what we\u2019re going to do is, we\u2019re going to open ourselves  up and have a discussion with many outside groups of all different parts of the economy, including, you know, an academi c conference in June in Chicago.", "One of the overarching facts is that rates have been really coming down overall for more than three decades now.", "We may be in a worl d where interest rates are jus t lower for the time being, and, therefore, we\u2019ll have less policy space to react to economic do wnturns.", "And we\u2019d want to be evaluating ideas for\u2014again, for be tter achieving the goals that  Congress has given us.", "We\u2019re not looking at law change s at all, and we\u2019re not looking at changing t he inflation target, for example.", "We are look ing for better ways to achieve  the inflation goal\u2014for example, on a symmetric basis.", "I think the dot plot generally does provide useful in formation about the reaction fu nction of Committee participants\u2014sometimes more usef ul than others, I\u2019ll admit.", "It\u2019s something that each of  us writes down, and we always update it as\u2014you know, as data come in and as we update our outlooks.", "And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes.", "So we don\u2019t think, you know, things that are happening at the short run\u2014at the short end\u2014are driven by many other factors other than  the balance sheet runoff.", "For  example, just\u2014very large bill supply has pushed up short-term rates, has pushed up repo rates .", "Tightening of the federal funds rate has raised short-term  borrowing costs.", "But we don\u2019t see, you know, the balan ce sheet runoff as creating significant problems.", "You know, we\u2019re w atching\u2014we have a strong forecast, generally, for next year.", "That  forecast involves growth, you k now, between 2 and 2\u00bd percent.", "It involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving un employment down and inflation near 2 percent.", "So that\u2019s a pretty positive forecast.", "As I mentioned, once you\u2014once you\u2019re, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think it\u2019s appropriate to be putting asi de individual estimates of that and be looking at what the incoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might be, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so\u2014and letting that lead you to adjust  your outlook and, therefore, yo ur appropriate path for policy.", "I\u2019m not worri ed, because\u2014about\u2014on the first q uestion\u2014 because I know, and everyone who works at the Fed knows, that w e\u2019re going to do our

arises.", "Does it current ly need to be restrictive?", "And I guess I would just go back to this:  The indiv idual forecasts are not something that the Committee votes on.", "We vote on the rate increase, and we write down our\u2014you know, our own personal paths.", "So people hav e disparate views on what the endpoint could be.", "But don\u2019t\u2014I wouldn\u2019t take it as a signal

what\u2014what you\u2019re  picking up now, I think, is,  there\u2019s, you know, a mood of concern, or it\u2019s a mood of angst about growth going for ward, if I could just capture it in one thought.", "There are many reasons  that are given for that, b ut, generally speaking, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a concern about, is growth going to be  as strong as it was?", "For now, financial conditions  have tightened a little bit .", "We\u2019ve taken t hat on board both in the outcomes, in our forecast, but also in a lower rate path to \u2014you know, to provide some accommodation to push back against that tightening.", "You know, financial conditions\u2014broadly speaki ng, we don\u2019t look at any one market.", "And what matters for the broader economy is material changes in a broad range of  financial conditions that are sustained for a period of time .", "A little bit of volatility\u2014spe aking in the abstract\u2014some volatility doesn\u2019t probably leave a mar k on the economy.", "There\u2019s been a tightening since right around after\u2014a week or so a fter the September meeting.", "A nd, you know, that\u2014we tried to factor that into our models of t he economy and to the results t hat come out of those models.", "But, remember, from a macroeconomic standpoint, no one market is the  single dominant indicator and it really matters if changes are sustained over time.", "Well, I think we look at both, but core PCE is a good indicator.", "It has\u2014what\u2019s happened over, rea lly, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to changes in growth.", "There was a  time when inflation reacted rea lly quickly to changes in growth and changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us.", "And t hat is often attributed to the success of central banks in anchorin g inflation expectations so  that people believe that inflation will come back to the target or a round the target so it doesn\u2019t  go down as much\u2014inflation doesn\u2019t go down as much in a  downturn and doesn\u2019t go up as much  when the\u2014you know, when the economy is strong.", "It\u2019s really true, though, that infl ation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent unemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment.", "But in terms of just targeting growth, you know , I think\u2014I actually think ou r dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and s table prices.", "When they work temporar ily in different ways, we tak e a balanced approach.", "An d so, being able to come out after each meeting and explain the Committee\u2019s thinking and relate th at to the state of the economy and expectations for policy and global developments, I think it \u2019ll be\u2014the idea is that it\u2019ll be helpful in explaining how we \u2019re thinking and, you know, explain ing what we\u2019re thinking about policy going forward.", "I do believe it wil l be a positive development.", "I think it\u2019ll also become the case, over time, that there will be no \u201cprior\u201d as to whether we would move at a quarterly mee ting or one of the meetings at which we do not file an S", "I mean, I  think that\u2019s probably pretty straightforward.", "If we, you know\u2014if we\u2019re\u2014if we want to communicate something about something that\u2019s going to happen in a future meeting, I  think we know how to do that in speeches, in press conferences, and such.", "So what we\u2019ve se en is, is a very gradual\u2014and, I think, ongoing\u2014increase in wages.", "If  you go back a few years,

year.", "Now they are all at 3, and they\u2019ve just con tinued to gradually move up\u2014not p erfectly in sync, but\u2014and that\u2019s a number that is, you know, right  in keeping with 2 percent inf lation and 1 percent productivity growth.", "So in an economic sense, it makes sense.", "I do expect, and I think many forecasters expect, that wage inc reases will continue, and that would be a welcome development.", "Wage\u2014wage increases do no t need to be inflationary.", "There\u2019s plenty of evidence of situations\u2014for example, in the very tight labor market of the late 1990s of a\u2014I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, w e had wage increases above productivity plus inflation, and w e didn\u2019t have high inflation.", "We hear a great deal of anecdotal infor mation about labor shortages, al ong with other, you know, bottlenecks and things.", "So I woul d expect that wages will keep  moving up, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean inflation.", "Labor s lack.", "So, you know, by most ind icators\u2014we look at a very wide range of indicator s on the labor market.", "And, b y most indicators, we are at or even above longer-run normal levels.", "But I would point to one particular pocket, and that is, labor force participation by younger prime-age workers, particu larly prime-age males, is still, Page 18 of 22     December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe

be higher than we had thought.", "And the sense of \u201ctailoring\u201d is that we want to look below the level of the G-SIBs at the l arge regionals and then on down to the community banks at
