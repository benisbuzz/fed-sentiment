solid rate of growth that, although a little slower than last year, remains well above June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 2 of 23   estimates of the pace necessary to

"Participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about three years.", "Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market.", "Looking ahead, w e expect that the job market will strengthen somewhat further.",

few months.", "Core inflation\u2014which excludes the volatile food and energy categories and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation\u2014has also edged lower.", "The recent lower readings on inflation have  been driven significantly by what appear to be one -off reductions in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services and prescription drugs.", "These price declines will, as a matter of arithmetic, restrain the 12 -month inflation figures until the extraordinarily low March reading drops out of the calculation.", "However, with employment near its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee still expects inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 per cent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer -run objective.", "Nonetheless, in light of the softer recent inflation readings, the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.", "Let me now turn to the economic projections that Committe e participants submitted for this meeting.", "As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 3 of 23   of appropriate monetary policy , which, in turn, depend on each participant \u2019s assessment of the many factors that shape the outlo ok.", "The median projection for growth

for the unemployment rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and ticks down to 4.2 percent in 2018 and 2019, modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.", "Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year and rises to 2 per cent in 2018 and 2019.", "Compared with the projections made in March, real GDP growth is little changed, the unemployment rate follows a moder ately lower path, and inflation\u2014alt hough marked down this year for reasons I mentioned earlier \u2014is unchanged over the following two years.", "In addition, the median estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate moved down a tenth to 4.6 percent.", "Returning to monetary policy, for the past year and a half the FOMC has been gradually increasing its target range for th e federal funds rate as the economy has continued to make progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability.", "We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer -run objective.", "That \u2019s based on our view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level \u2014that is, the level of the  federal funds rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel.", "Because the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise all that much furth er to get to a neutral policy stance.", "But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 4 of 23   to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.", "Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer -run neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.", "This view is consistent with participants \u2019 projections of appropriate monetary policy.", "The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, and 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, about in line with its estimated longer -run value.", "Compared with the projections made in March, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged.", "As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes t o their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks.", "As I \u2019ve noted previously, policy is not on a preset course.", "Let me now turn to our balance sheet.", "As I noted in our policy statement, we are continuing to maintain the size of our balanc e sheet by reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities.", "Provided that the economy evolves broadly as the Committee anticipates, we currently expect to begin implementing a b alance sheet normalization program this year.", "Consistent with the principles and plans we released in 2014, this program would gradually decrease our reinvestments and initiate a gradual and largely predictable decline in our securities holdings.", "The adde ndum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that we released today provides further information.", "For both Treasury and agency securities, we will reinvest proceeds from our holdings only to the extent that they exc eed gradually rising caps on  the reductions in our securities holdings.", "These caps will gradually rise over the course of a year to maximums of $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency securities and will remain in place through the normalization process.", "By limiting the volume of securities that private inve stors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings, the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains.", "As I previously noted, when our securities holdings begin to gradually decline, so too will the supply of reserve balances in the banking system.", "At some point, probably a few years down the road, the Committee will bring the decline in our balance sheet to an end as the quantity of reserves is normalized.", "I can \u2019t tell you what the longer -run normal level of reserve balances will be because that will depend on the Committee \u2019s eventual decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the longer run, as well as a number of as -yet unknown elements, including the banking syst em\u2019s future demand for reserves and various factors that may affect the daily supply of reserves.", "What I can tell you is that we anticipate reducing reserve balances and our overall balance sheet to levels appreciably below those seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis.", "As readers of our minutes know, the Committee has on previous occasions discussed potential long -run frameworks for implementing monetary policy.", "Decisions about the appropriate long -run framework do not need to be  made for quite some time, and our future deliberations will benefit from the experience we will gain during the normalization process.", "At this point, I \u2019ll just point out that our current system is working well and has some important advantages.", "In parti cular, it is simple and efficient to operate, does not require active management of the supply of reserves, and, most importantly, provides good control over the June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 6 of 23   federal funds rate and effective transmission of changes in the federal funds rate to broader money market rates.", "And because our current system is likely compatible with a much smaller quantity of reserves, our plan for gradually reducing our balance sheet does not constrain the Committee \u2019s future options for how to implement monetary policy.", "Finally, as noted in today \u2019s addendum, the Committee affirmed that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our  primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.", "In other words, the balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times.", "However, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate.", "More generally, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.", "So that is something that we \u2019ve said for some time , and I \u2019ve previously \u2014when I \u2019ve been asked what \u201c well under  way \u201d means \u2014said that I don \u2019t want to define that in purely quantitative terms but rather in qualitative terms.", "So there \u2019s no specific level of the federal funds rate that means we\u2019 re well under  way.", "But it\u2019 s also a question of not only the current level , but our confidence in the outlook and our projections for the future path of June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 7 of 23   the federal funds rate.", "So we have increased our federal funds rate target now several times.", "Our outlook is that we anticipate further increases this year and next year for the federal funds rate , and our statement indicates that if the economy continues to evolve in the manner  that we expect , that we would feel the conditions are in \u2014will be in place to begin this process this year.", "So what I \u2019ve said about my own situation is that I fully intend to serve out my term as C hair, which ends in early February.", "And I do very much hope \u2014I know that they have been working hard to identify appropriate nominees for the open slots , and I do very much hope that there will be nominations in the not -too-distant future , and that the Senate will take those up expeditiously.", "I look forward to having a full B oard.", "So let me just say , as I emphasized in my statement and always say , mone tory policy is not on a preset course.", "We indicated in our statement  today that we \u2019re closely monitoring inflation developments and certainly have taken note of the fact that there have been several weak readings , particular ly on core inflation.", "Our statement indicates that we expect inflation to remain low in the near te rm.", "But , on the other hand, we continue to feel that with a strong labor market  and a labor market that \u2019s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up.", "Now, obviously we need to monitor that very carefully  and ensure , especially with roughly five years o f inflation running under our 2 percent  objective \u2014that is a goal to which the committee is strongly committed.", "And we need to make sure that we have in place the policies that are necessary to achieve 2 percent  inflation , and I pledge that we  will do that.", "But let me say , with respect to recent readings, i t\u2019s important not to overreact to a few readings , and data on inflation can be noisy.", "As I pointed out, there have been some idiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months, particularly a  huge decline in cell telephone service plan prices, some declines in prescription drugs.", "But we are \u2014this morning \u2019s reading on the CPI showed weakness in a number of categories , and it \u2019s certainly something that we will be closely monitoring in the months ahead.", "We will\u2014we \u2019re focused on making our policy decisions on the medium -term outlook, and we will, you know, be looking carefully at incoming data and, a s always , revising our outlook and policy plans as appropriate.", "So \u2014continue , as today \u2019s actions show , to feel that the economy is doing well, is showing resilience .", "We hav e a very strong labor market, an un employment rate that\u2019s declined to levels we ha ve not seen since 2001.", "And , even with some modera tion in the pace of job growth, we have a labor market that continues to strengthen and policy remains \u2014remains  accommodative.", "So, I \u2014it\u2019 s important that inflation move up to our 2 percent objective , as our projections  show we cont inue to expect that and be lieve  the conditions are in place.", "But we will monitor incoming data , obviously , and be attentive to rethinking our outlook if it seems appropriate.", "Well, we are closely looking at the actual performance of inflation and altering our views on the basis of discrepancies between what we see and our expectations.", "And, well, it is very difficult to pin down what is the longer -run normal rate of unemployment , and there \u2019s a great deal of uncertainty about it , and it \u2019s hard to pin down, especially given the June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 10 of 23   fact that the so -called Phillips curve  appears to be quite flat.", "That means that inflation doesn \u2019t respond very much or very quickly to movements in unemployment.", "We have seen that operate historically.", "Now, in the face of very low unemployment that we have seen, while wage growth has picked up somewhat, it remains low , and inflation is influenced by a number of different factors , but we certainly haven \u2019t seen much or any evident upward pressure on inflation.", "In light of that, the C ommittee has successively moved down its estimate of the normal longer -run rate of unemployment , and in this projection, it\u2019 s moved down to 4.6 percent , a tenth lower than it  was last time.", "So, while the unemployment rate is below that, it\u2019 s not that much\u2014it\u2019 s not that much below it.", "So I would say that business and household sentiment remains quite strong, although many forecasters have pushed back somewhat the timing of the  expected policy changes , such as changes to tax policy or  fiscal policy more generally.", "I would say that , based on my observation of actual spending behavior and my discussions with our wide range of contacts , that I haven \u2019t seen very much evidence that , thus far , expectations of policy changes have driven substantial changes in either consumer spending or investment spending.", "Many of our business contacts \u2014I think their June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 11 of 23   confidence remains high.", "Well, in deciding what the appropriate path of rates is, we take many different factors into account.", "We have certainly noticed the stock market is up considerably over the last year.", "That usually shows up in financial conditions indexes and is an important reason why some of them show easier financial conditions.", "There\u2019 s been a modest decrease recently in the value of the dollar , although it \u2019s up substantially since mid -2014.", "So we take those factors into account in deriving our forecasts and deciding the appropriate stance of policy.", "We have done that , and \u2014but other things also affect the stance of policy.", "We \u2019re not targetin g financial conditions.", "We \u2019re trying to set a path of the federal funds rate, but taking account of those factors and others that don\u2019 t show up in a  financial conditions index.", "We\u2019re trying to generate paths for employment and inflation that meet our man dated objectives.", "So I don\u2019 t think central  bank credibility \u2014at least the F ed\u2019s credibility \u2014has been impaired.", "We look at a whole variety of indicators of inflation expectations .", "Professional forecasters \u2014whether it \u2019s in the B lue Chip or the S urvey of Professional F orecasters, those expectations have remained  quite steady and in close alignment with our 2 percent  inflation target.", "TIPS -based  measures of inflation compensation do not provide straight reads on market participants \u2019 estimates and expectations about inflation.", "They embody other elements \u2014risk premia and liquidity premia as well.", "It is true that some household surveys of  inflation expectations have moved down, but overall I wouldn\u2019 t say that we \u2019ve seen a broad undermining of inflation expect ations.", "But you asked also, I guess , about have structural changes perhaps impacted the inflation process , and that certainly is possible.", "And estimates of the normal longer -run unemployment rate\u2014they are quite uncertain.", "And policy is not being \u2014is not based on some firmly held preconceived notion.", "We\u2019re watching very carefully how the actual economy performs.", "And, you know, I continue to believe, though, that with job growth running well in excess , even with the moderation of the level that \u2019s needed to provide for new entrants  in the labor market, we do have a strengthening economy .", "With policy accommodative , all that we \u2019re doin g in raising rates is moving \u2014removing a bit of accommodation heading toward a neutral pace.", "We\u2019re not moving so aggressively as to put a br ake on continued improvement in the labor June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 13 of 23   market.", "But I think that that \u2019s a prudent  move , to move in a gradual way to remove accommodation , with unemplo yment now \u2014and not only , I should say , the unemployment rate , but I think any indicator of labor market performance and  tightness that you could look at , whether it \u2019s household perceptions  of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings , all of these indicators do signal a tight labor mar ket.", "Now, with inflation below 2 percent , I think it\u2019 s appropriate that the labor market be that tight.", "But , on the other hand, I think we want to avoid the risk.", "We want to keep the expansion on a sustainable path and avoid the risk that at some point we need\u2014we find ourselves in a situation where we \u2019ve done nothing and then need to raise the funds rate so rapidly that we risk a recession.", "So moving to some extent in a timely way to remove accommodation with a strong economy and continued labor market strength, the C ommittee believes , is an appropriate  management of risks.", "But we are attentive to the fact that inflation is running below our 2 percent objective , that we \u2019ve faced that  situation now for a long time , and it\u2019 s really quite essential that we put in place policies that will succeed in moving inflation back to our 2 percent objective , and it \u2019s a symmetric objective.", "So that \u2019s a risk that we face as well.", "The C ommittee believes we have conditions in place for inflation to move up, but that \u2019s also a risk .", "And those things point , I think, to a gradual pace of reducing accommodation.", "So, at  the time that we adopted the 2 percent  target \u2014it was back in 2012\u2014we had a very thorough discussion of the factors that should determine what our inflation objective should be.", "Now, at the moment, we are highly foc used on trying to achieve our 2 percent  objective.", "And we recognize the fact that inflation has been running below , and it \u2019s essential for us to move inflation back to that objective.", "Now, we \u2019ve learned a lot in the meantime , and assessments of the level of the neutral likely level , currently and going forward, of the neutral federal funds rate have changed and are quite a bit lower than they stood in 2012 or earlier years.", "And that means that the economy is \u2014has the potential where policy could be constrained by the zero lower bound more frequently than at the time that we adopted our 2 percent objective.", "So it \u2019s that recognition that causes  people to think we might be better off with a higher inflation objective, and that \u2019s an important set\u2014this is one of our most critical decision s and one we are attentive to evidence and outside thinking.", "But a reconsideration of that objective needs to take account not only of benefits of a higher in\u2014 potential benefits of a higher inflation target, but also the potential cost s that could be associated with it.", "It needs to be a balanced assessment.", "But  I would say that this is one of the most important questions facing monetary policy around the world in the future , and we very much look forward to seeing research by economists that will help inform our future decisions on this.", "So let me first say , it\u2019s not straightforward to determine exactly what expectations are embodied in market prices because there are t erm premia that affect these rates , and they may not really be as low as one would infer from a straight read.", "That said, in part, expectations reflect estimates of what the neutral federal funds rate is and how it \u2019s likely to evolve over time.", "And views have changed about that over time , and  there is a good deal of uncertainty about it.", "So we have recently put out charts that try to show what the range  of uncertainty is around our path for the federal funds rate, especially as one goes further out.", "There\u2019 s a good deal of uncertainty and\u2014tha t reflects the, like \u2014all the shocks that can affect the evolution of the economy , and also the fact, we \u2019re quite uncertain ourselves about what the likely \u2014what the evolution will be of the neutral federal funds rate.", "So we do try to write that down and provide the public with information about our current expectations.", "And the median now stands at around 3 percent , but we have uncertainty about that.", "Many of my colleagues and I think that the current neutral level is  lower than that.", "And as I said in my opening statement, the fed funds rate path reflects an expectation that that neutral rate will be moving up some in future years.", "But that remains uncertain , and I think that \u2019s something that market participants are trying to assess , and we will be as well.", "And I think the market is aware of the  views of June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 16 of 23   participants  and is  assessing evidence itself to form their own views.", "And it \u2019s imp ortant that the market take an independent look, and that we get to understand and see how market participants are interpreting evidence on the evolution of the economy.", "So we have indicated for quite some time, I guess, since  our\u2014at least since our 2014 normalization principles , that we wanted to reduce our balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way.", "And today \u2019s ann ouncement is another step in providing further details about how we plan to proceed s o that when this plan does go into effect, no one is taken by surprise and market participants understand how this will work.", "I think that we \u2014the plan is one that is consc iously intended to avoid creating market strains and to allow the market to adjust to a very gradual and predictable plan.", "My hope and expectation is that when we decide to go forward with this plan, that there will be very little reaction to it, that it\u2019 s clear how we intend to proceed, and that this is something that will just run quietly in the background over a number of years, leading to a reduction in the size of our June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 17 of 23   balance sheet and in the outstanding stock of reserves, and that it \u2019s something that the C ommittee will not be reconsidering from time to time.", "Look, of course, if it turns out that there is a surpr ise and a substantial reaction , that is something we would have to take into account in deciding on the appropriate stance of policy.", "Well, with respect to the impact of c redit con ditions and bank regulation on slow growth, I \u2019ve previously , in testifying , indicated that I don \u2019t think that our regulations have played an important role , at least broadly speaking , in impeding credit growth and the growth of the economy.", "And I \u2019ve pointed in the past to a number of statistics suggesting that cred it growth continues to be  healthy, including among small \u2014smaller community banks that are most concerned with regulatory burden.", "I think when banks are undercapitalized and weak, that i mpedes credit growth.", "And when banks are strong, they \u2019re in a much better position to lend.", "June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 18 of 23   Now, in terms of regulation, the Treasury recently issued, on Monday , a detailed report.", "But I would say it underscores the importance of capital , liquidity, stress testing, and re solution planning in having a safe and sound banking system , which are views that I and my colleagues have long espoused.", "Regulatory burden, when it \u2019s possible to ease it , and a good deal of the Treasury report is focused on regulatory burden, that \u2019s some thing that all regulators should be looking to do.", "We strongly believe in the importance of tailoring our regulation to the size and complexity of institutions, of finding ways to relieve burden for community banks.", "We have been focused and had a number of initiatives already in that direction, look ing for ways , for example, to simplify capital requirements for community banks.", "And we \u2019ll continue in that direction and, in that sense, in those areas certainly share the views expressed in the Treasury repo rt.", "Well, I have felt that it\u2019 s been appropriate for interest rates to remain low for a very long time.", "We are in the process of , as the economy strengthens , normalizing interest rates.", "But, certainly, we \u2019ve had a lot of years in which interest rates have been low.", "I thought it was necessary to support the economy at that time and was strongly in favor of those policies.", "So we have tried as meticulously as we can to provide advanced warning to markets about how we would go about doing this so that market participants can prepare.", "But if the economy evolves in line with our expectations , which, you know, we will be watching \u2014always are\u2014we could put this into effect relatively soon.", "You asked about w hether or not we would do that and raise rates at the same meeting, and I would say, we \u2019ve made no decision about that, and it really hinges on the outlook and our assessment of conditions.", "So we have previously su ggested exempting community banks, smaller banks , entirely from the rule.", "Implementation of it is frankly complex , and I \u2019m certainly open to looking at ways to reduce regulatory burden in that area.", "But on implementation, it\u2019 s true that the rules were\u2014in part reflecting the way the legislation is written \u2014were, I think, necessarily complex, but we do have some ideas for how we might simplify the rule , and certainly it \u2019s something we \u2019re quite open to looking at.", "Well, I mean, Treasury has a \u2014set out a list of objectives for regulation that I \u2019m sympathetic to and endorse .", "I think looking for ways to reduce regulatory burden, when it can be done without sacrificing safety and soundness or creating sys temic risk , that\u2019s something that all regulators should want to do.", "And coming back and looking at where we have created burdens and ways in which we can simplify to reduce, that is  an objective that is core to the Treasury review and that we are very sympathetic with.", "I mean, staff in the Federal Reserve and outside economists have done a great deal of work trying to evaluate", "But I would say , the use of QE in the United States relat ive to the size of our economy is not as high as it \u2019s been in some other countries that have employed it.", "Well, I \u2019m not going to comment on the P resident \u2019s budget , and these programs can be undertaken at many different levels.", "I do think we have a tight labor market and one where employers have jobs where they \u2019re finding difficulty identifying workers with the appropriate skills.", "In my own discussions with businesses, what I hear more of \u2014and this is something I think is a great aspect of a tight labor market \u2014larger firms are spending more on tr aining and trying to, given that they can\u2019 t hire workers with the ideal skills, are training people to fill jobs that they have available.", "They would real ly very much like to participate along , for example, with community colleges or nonprofits to see such programs launched and have jobs that people could fill if they received the appropriate training.", "So I do think that this is an important area, and, especially given the pressures that have, you know, existed for a long time \u2014downward pressure on wages and job
