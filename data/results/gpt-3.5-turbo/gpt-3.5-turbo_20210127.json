unemployment rate is close to 10  percent  if you include people that \u2019ve left the labor force \u2014it\u2019s very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to support

at \u2014and we made that framework public after the financial crisis so that it c ould be criticized and understood and we could be held accountable.", "And , you know, the things that we look at are \u2014we do look at asset prices.", "We also look at leverage in the banking system.", "We look at leverage in the  non\u2014the  nonbanking system, which is to say , corporates and households.", "And

when we get to the nonfinancial sector, we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019t  have jurisdiction over that.", "But\u2014so I would just say that our \u2014that there are many things that go in, as you know, to, to setting asset prices.", "So if you look at what \u2019s really been driving asset prices, really , in the last couple of months , it isn \u2019t monetary  policy.", "And it \u2019s also financial\u2014 sorry, fiscal policy .", "Those are \u2014those are the news items that have been driving , driving asset purchases \u2014sorry, asset values in , in recent months.", "So I, I know that monetary policy does play a role there , but that \u2019s how we look at it.", "And I think, you know, I think that the connection between low interest rates and , and asset January 27, 2021 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 9 of 28   values is probably something that \u2019s not as tight as people think, because a lot of \u2014a lot of  different factors are driving asset prices at any given time.", "So, you know, that \u2019s\u2014as you know, that \u2019s one of the very difficult questions in all of monetary policy.", "And we don \u2019t rule it out as a theoretical matter , but we , we clearly look to macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools rather than monetary policy in , in addressing financial stability issues.", "It\u2019s not \u2014you know, the , the monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well -understood channels.", "And a strong economy is actually a great supporter of financial stabilit y.", "That will mean strong, you know, well -capitalized institutions , and, and households will be \u2014will be working.", "We don\u2019 t actually understand the tradeoff between\u2014the sense of it is, would you\u2014if you raise interest rates and ther eby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in order to address asset bubbles and things like that , what \u2014will that even help?", "We would rely on macroprudential and other tools to deal with financial stability issues.", "So , on inflation,  a couple of things \u2014there are a couple of things that are worth mentioning.", "One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12 -month basis.", "And as we \u2014as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, we\u2019ll see measured 12 -month inflation move up a few tenths.", "There \u2019s also the possibility \u2014indeed, it \u2019s in some forecasts\u2014 that as the economy fully reopens, there \u2019ll be a burst of spending, and\u2014because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation.", "Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we would review \u2014we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation.", "I think  if you \u2014you know, it helps to look back at , at the inflation dynamics that the United States has had now for some decades a nd notice that there has been, you know, significant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades.", "Inflation has averaged less than 2  percent  for a quarter of a century.", "And the inflation dynamics , with the flat Phillips c urve and low persistence of inflation , is very much intact.", "We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don\u2019 t January 27, 2021 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 11 of 28   change rapidly.", "So we think it \u2019s very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you know, troubling inflation.", "Of course, if w e did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have tools for that.", "It\u2019 s far harder to deal with , with  too low inflation.", "We know what to do with higher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we , we would have those tools.", "In terms of how much, you know, what we \u2019ve said is we \u2019d like to see \u2014because inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent , we\u2019d like to see it run moderately above 2  percent  for some time.", "We\u2019re going to\u2014w e, we use policy rules and formulas in everything we do, consult them constantly, but we don\u2019 t set policy by them.", "And so we \u2019re going to preserve an element of judgment.", "And, again, we \u2019ll seek inflation moderately above 2  percent  for some time.", "And we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent .", "So , in terms of the rollout of the vaccines, we see what everyone else sees, right?", "We see that we\u2019 re, we\u2019re  vaccinating people and at a rate of about a million a day, apparently , and that  it\u2019ll take quite a while to get \u2014to get  to the numbers that the expert s say are required to get to herd immunity.", "You\u2019ll notice that we , we said that the , the pandemic still, still  provides considerable downside risks to the economy.", "In this case, we particularly look at the downside risks.", "You know, that \u2019s really what we do is , we, we set policies so that we\u2019re , we\u2019re, you know , we\u2019re going to remain accommodative until we actually see improvement in the economy and not just in the outlook, in the data.", "And I would\u2014I would also add, there \u2019s nothing more important to the economy now than, than people getting vaccinated.", "You know, if you\u2014if you, you think about the places where the economy is weak\u2014I mentioned bars and restaurants .", "That\u2019s 400,000 jobs we lost last month, a nd that \u2019s all because of the spread of the pandemic.", "Many other  areas of the economy \u2014actually, there was actually job creation in \u2014you know, in goods production and in some service parts \u2014industries as well.", "A nd that includes \u2014you know, that includes us at the F ed, monetary policy.", "I mean, remember, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  focused on maximum employment, price stability, financial stability as I defined it\u2014 the broad financial sector.", "Well, first , I\u2014we , we think our policy stance is , is just right.", "We think it \u2019s providing significant support for economic activity and hiring.", "We, you know, we , we adopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August.", "In September, we, we implemented rate guidance that , that  was consistent wit h and based on that new framework.", "In December, we did the same for asset purchases.", "So we now have, you know, strong guidance on, on rates and on asset purchases that \u2019s providing very strong support for economic activity.", "If you look at the sectors of t he economy that are interest sensitive, you will see very strong activity :  housing, durable goods, automobile sales.", "And we think that , that  they are \u2014we think our policy stance is , is right.", "With asset purchases, for example,  we can, you know \u2014that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a tool we can do more \u2014we can strengthen our guidance , too, if we were to think that that were appropriate.", "What you see is an economy where what \u2019s holding it back is not the lack of , of policy sup port from the F ed.", "It\u2019s, it\u2019s the spread of the disease and people \u2019s reluctance or , or inability to partake in certain kinds of economic activities, which amount to a , a meaningful part of the economy.", "You know, in terms of \u2014in terms of tapering, it \u2019s just premature.", "We said we \u2019d want to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we modify our , our asset purchase guidance.", "And we \u2019ll do that well in advance of actually considering what will be a pretty gradual  taper.", "We raised interest rates .", "We froze the balance sheet size, and then we shrank the balance sheet size.", "And, you know, we , we understand \u2014as we understood then, but even more so\u2014we understand that the \u2014that the way to do it is to communicate well in advance, to , to do predictab le things, and to move gradually.", "We \u2019re focused on finishing the job we \u2019re doing, which is to support the economy, to give the economy the support it needs.", "There are people out there who\u2019 ve lost their jobs.", "But in the meantime, our focus is on giving the economy the support it needs.", "I, I would say that , again, we have been struggling with disinflationary forces for some time.", "If you look around the world\u2014look in Western Europe, look at Japan\u2014around the world, large economies have , have  felt much more downward pressure on inflation, have fallen short of  their inflation goals , for some time now.", "That is the broad global macroeconomic context that we all live in.", "Now, they may slow down, a nd, and it \u2019s, it\u2019s an interesting question, the extent to which, for example, globalization may slow down or even reverse.", "Notwithstanding that , inflation dynamics in the United States have , have  consis ted of a flat Phillips c urve and low persistence for , for a long time.", "We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly.", "You know, these things are \u2014these things are, are  changing, but they don\u2019t change at a rapid rate.", "So I wouldn\u2019t \u2014I\u2019m, I\u2019m not \u2014I\u2019m  much more worried about falling short of a complete recovery and losing people \u2019s careers and lives that they \u2014that they  built because they don \u2019t get to work \u2014back to work in time and things like that.", "I\u2019m more concerned about that and the damage that will do not just to their lives, but to the United States economy, to the productive capacity of the economy.", "I \u2019m more concern ed about that than about the possibility, which exists , of higher inflation.", "Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation.", "The kind of troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems , seems  far away and unlikely in, in  the both domestic and global context that we \u2019ve been in for some time.", "We \u2019ll also have a good institut ional relationship between the F ed and the Treasury.", "It\u2019ll be collaborative .", "Now, the way that works is , is that, you know, we know \u2014the agencies know each other well, and this is true of finance ministries and central banks around the world.", "I do expect very soon to January 27, 2021 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 18 of 28   begin our regular calls or \u2014and, and ultimately meetings , which have gone on, really , for, you know, 70 years.", "T he Treasury Secretary and the, and the  Fed Chair have had weekly or so meetings, lunches, breakfast, calls, depending on the situation.", "So I \u2014I\u2019ll just say that I think our facilities were very successful in supporting the economy during its darkest moments and I believe saved \u2014protected the loss of millions of jobs.",

emergency lending tools will remain available.", "Now, I \u2019ve had no discussions with anybody at Treasury on that, because I haven\u2019 t had any discussions with anybody at Treasury other than meet \u2014you know, high- level meetings with the\u2014with the  transition team a month or so ago.", "And once we start having those , those  meetings, of course, I \u2019ll observe, you know, the long- standing practice of not talking about confidential discussions.", "Ye s.

"It\u2019s not in the medium term.", "We were thinking \u2014when we were thinking \u201c medium term, \u201d we were thinking of longer -term scarring and things like that.", "Nonetheless, I mean, I think what \u2014to go to your , your  second question, and as I mentioned in my, in my  opening r emarks \u2014there is good evidence to, to support a stronger economy i n the second half of this year.", "In fact, if you look at , at\u2014as we do \u2014look at a range of private forecasters, what was their forecast in , in December , and what \u2019s their forecast now?", "Right ac ross the board :  much higher forecast s for 2021 growth.", "And that \u2019s because of the ongoing rollout of the vaccines and also because of fiscal policy, expectations , and the reality of , of the CRR A

housing is now \u2014the level of housing activity is at its highest level since  before the Global F inancial C risis, in some measures .", "So we\u2019ve had a very strong rebound in housing.",

need another house and a different house \u2014or a second house ,\u201d in some cases.", "So there \u2019s just\u2014there\u2019s  a\u2014there\u2019s a one -time shift in demand that we think will

those price increases are unlikely to be sustained for , for all of those reasons.", "So you asked about corporate debt, I guess ?", "So we , we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty carefully.", "And , you know, what \u2019s happened in, in  the corporate debt market , beginning with the announcement of our corporate credit facility, has been , you\u2019 ve seen lenders
