that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.\u201d  This new language does not represent a change  in our policy intentions and is fully consistent with our previous guidance, wh ich stated that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal f unds rate for a considerable time after the end of our asset purchase program.", "But with that pr ogram having ended in October, and the economy continuing to make progress toward our objectives, the Committee judged that some modification to our guidance is appr opriate at this time.", "I will ha ve more to say about our policy decisions in a moment, but first let me review  recent economic developments and the outlook.", "In the labor market, progress continues toward the FOMC\u2019s objective of maximum employment.", "The pace of job growth has been strong recently, with job gains averaging nearly 280,000 per month over the past 3 months; over the past 12 months, job

a moderate pace of growth going forward.", "Inflation has continued to r un below the Committee\u2019s 2 percen t objective, and the recent sizable declines in oil prices wi ll likely hold down overall inflation in the near term.", "But as the effects of these oil price declines  and other transitory factors dissi pate and as resource utilization continues to rise, the Committee expects inflation to  move gradually back toward its objective.", "In making this forecast, the Committee is mindf ul of the recent declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation.", "At this point, the Committee vi ews these movements as likely to prove transitory, and survey-based measur es of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.", "That said, developments in this area obviously bear close watching.", "This outlook is reflected in the individua l economic projections submitted in conjunction with this meeting by the FOMC participants.", "As always, each participant\u2019s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.", "The central tendency of the unemployment rate projections is slightly lowe r than in the September projections and now stands at 5.2 to 5.3 percent at the end of next year, in line w ith its estimated longer-run normal level.", "Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate

GDP growth is 2.3 to 2.4 percent for 2014, up a bit from the September projections.", "Over the next three years, the projections for real GDP growth run somewhat above the estimates of longer-run normal growth.", "Finally, although FOMC pa rticipants project inflation in the near term to be lower on account of the decline in energy prices, they co ntinue to see inflation moving gradually back toward 2 percent.", "The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.0 to 1.6 percent next year, rising to 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2017.", "As I noted earlier, the Committee \u201creaffirmed its view that the cu rrent 0 to \u00bc percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.\u201d  Regarding forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our October statement indicated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate  for a considerable time following the end of our asset purchase program, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run goal.", "Today\u2019s statement, which indicates that  \u201cthe Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stan ce of monetary policy,\u201d does not signify any change in the Committee\u2019s polic y intentions as set forth in its recent statements.", "As before, this judgment is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment of  realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation\u2014an assessment that is based on a wide range of information, includ ing measures of labor market c onditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, a nd readings on financial developments.", "Given that the Committee is not signaling a change in policy, why did we update our guidance?", "The reason is that, with the asse t purchase program having been wound down in October, it seemed less helpful to continue to  communicate about the possible timing of our first rate increase with reference to an event that is re ceding into the past.", "Inst ead, we have shifted to December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL

U.S. economy is strengthening, reflecting, in part, a highly accomm odative stance of monetary policy.", "Of course, inflation has been running somewhat below our go al of 2 percent, but we  project that gap to close gradually over time.", "As progress in achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation continues, at some point it will become appropriate to begin reducing policy accommodation.", "But, based on its current outlook, the Committee judges that it can be patient in doing so.", "In particular, the Committee consider s it unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings.", "If incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee\u2019s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target  range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than curren tly anticipated.", "Convers ely, if progress proves sl ower than expected, then increases in the target range are likel y to occur later than currently anticipated.", "Once we begin to remove policy accommoda tion, it continues to be the Committee\u2019s assessment that, \u201ceven after employment and in flation are near manda te-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\u201d  This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy given by FOMC pa rticipants.", "Assuming that the economy evolves broadly in line with participants\u2019 expectations, almost all participants believe that it will be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate in 2015.", "There are a range of views on the appropriate timing of liftoff within the year, in part reflecting differences in participants\u2019 expectatio ns for how the economy will evolve.", "By the time December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL \u00a0Page 5 of 23 \u00a0of liftoff, participants expect to see some furt her decline in the unemplo yment rate and additional improvement in labor market conditions.", "They also expect core inflat ion to be running near current levels but foresee being reasonably confid ent in their expectation that inflation will move back toward our 2 percent longer-run inflation obj ective over time.", "Of course, as I previously emphasized, the timing of the initial rise in the fe deral funds rate target, as well as the path for the target thereafter,  are contingent on  economic conditions.", "By late 2016, the median projection for the federal funds rate, at 2.5 percent, remains more than 1 percentage point below the longer-ru n value of 3\u00be percent or so projected by most participants, even though the centr al tendency of the unemployment rate by that time is slightly below its estimated longer-run value and the centr al tendency for inflation is close to our 2 percent objective.", "FOMC part icipants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate running below its normal longe r-run level at that time\u2014in part icular, the residual effects of the financial crisis, which are likely to conti nue to constrain househol d spending and constrain credit availability for some time.", "But as these f actors dissipate further, mo st participants expect the federal funds rate to move close to its longer-run normal level by the end of 2017.", "Finally, the Committee will continue its polic y of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments fr om holdings of agency debt and M", "So I did say that the stat ement that the Committee can be patient should be interpreted as meaning that it is unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings.", "Now, that doesn\u2019t  point to any preset or  predetermined time at which normalization is\u2014will begin.", "There are a range of views on the Committee, and it will be dependent on how incoming data bear on the progress the ec onomy is making.", "First of all, I want to emphasize that no meeti ng is completely off the table, in the sense that if we do see faster progress toward our obj ectives than we currently expect, then it is possible that the process of nor malization would occur sooner than we now an ticipate.", "A number of Committee participants have indicated that, in their view, conditions could be appropriate by the middle of next year, but there is no preset time.", "You asked also, I think, about inflation.", "A nd, as I mentioned in my press statement, especially with the downward pressures on inflat ion that we expect to see for a little while because of declining oil prices and falling import pr ices, we certainly expect headline inflation to December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL \u00a0Page 7 of 23 \u00a0be under downward pressure for a while.", "And, as I mentioned, most participants do envision that conditions will be appropriate sometime during th is coming year to begin normalizing policy.", "And they do largely expect that inflation will be\u2014core inflation will probably be running close to its current level.", "And headline inflation could ev en be lower.", "But what they will want to have is a feeling of reasonabl e confidence that when we start the process of normalizing policy, that it will be moving up over time.", "And, of course, as labor market conditions continue to improve, history suggests that as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, that that\u2019s likely to occur.", "Every meeting that we have is a live meeting at which th e Committee could make a policy decision.", "So I would really like to strongly disc ourage the expectation that policy moves can only occur when there\u2019s a scheduled press conference.", "And we have long had in place the ability to hold a press c onference call, rather than an in-person press conference.", "So the Committee, clearly, would want to be able to explain its reasoning.", "As we  begin the process of normalizing policy, every meeting is live.", "And if we were to decide at a meeting to begin to normalize policy, I expect we would hold a press conference call.", "We\u2019re very attentive to global developments and certainly discuss them in the meeting.", "The very s ubstantial decline we have seen in oil prices is one of the most important developments shaping th e global outlook.", "It will have different effects in different regions and could well have effects on financial markets, as we are seeing.", "I think the judgment of the Committee is that, from the standpoint of the United States and the U.S. outlook, that the decline we have seen in oil pri ces is likely to be, on net, a positive.", "It\u2019s something that\u2019s certainly good for families, for households.", "Having to spend less on gas and energy, a nd so, in that sense, it\u2019s like a tax cut that boosts their spending power.", "But, on balance, I w ould see these developments as a positive for the standpoint of the U.S. economy.", "With respect to deflation, we see downward pr essure on headline inflation from declining energy prices.", "We certainly recognize that that  is going to be pushing down headline inflation and may even spill over, to some extent, to core inflation.", "But, at this point, although we indicated we\u2019re monitoring inflation developmen ts carefully, we see these developments as transitory.", "And the Committee continues to be lieve\u2014especially with the improvement we\u2019re seeing in the labor market, which we expect to continue\u2014that inflation will move back up to our December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL \u00a0Page 9 of 23 \u00a02 percent objective over time.", "What I want to say is that our objective is to communicate as clearly as we pos sibly can about our plans and how we see the economic environment unfolding.", "When the pa rticipants in the Committee fill out their projections, they\u2019re asked to give  the path of the federal funds rate and of the various economic variables that they consider most likely.", "They\u2019re not asked to talk about all the different things that could happen, recognizing there is uncertaint y, and the paths of the funds rate that they would consider appropriate if t hose other alternatives were to happen.", "But other alternatives, I think, are priced into the market.", "And one reason  that the market prices may be different than the Committee\u2019s is because they place probability on other outcomes that look different than what they regard as the modal forecast.", "They ma y also have a different set of expectations about how the\u2014about the economic outlook and how it\u2019s lik ely to unfold.", "But what I do want to do is communicate as clearly as I can, on behalf of the Committee, how we think the economy\u2019s likely to progress and how we would likel y set the federal funds rate over time if that forecast bears out.", "There are a number of different  factors that are b earing on the path of market interest rates, I think, in cluding global economic developments .", "It is often the case that when oil prices move down and the dollar apprecia tes, that that tends to put downward pressure on inflation compensation and on longer-term rates.", "We also have safe-haven flows that may be affecting longer-term Treasury yields.", "So I can\u2019t tell you exactly what is driving market developments.", "Well I\u2014I\u2019d sa y, you know, that I think what we have seen since the mid-\u201980s is that, in an environment where in flation expectations ar e well anchored, that movements in oil and commodity pr ices and import prices tend to have transitory effects on the inflation outlook.", "There were many years in which we  had unanticipated increa ses in oil prices,   really beginning in 2004 and 2005, that put upwar d pressure on headline inflation and sometimes even spilled through into core, and, typicall y, the Committee looked through those impacts on inflation with the view that they would be transi tory.", "And I think that\u2019s the Committee\u2019s expectati on here.", "Inflation, even core inflation, has been running below our inflation objective.", "Movements in oil, you know, now down and perhaps later up, will move inflation around, certainly headline inflation.", "But the Committee, at this point, anticipates those impacts to be transitory.", "So as long as participants December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL \u00a0Page 11 of 23 \u00a0feel reasonably confident that the inflation pr ojection is one where we  expect to meet our 2 percent objective ove r time, that\u2019s what I thi nk how they\u2019ll be looking at  things as we decide on the path for the funds rate.", "And with respect to infl ation\u2014our forecast for inflation and inflation expectations, let me start by saying I think it\u2019s important th at monetary policy be forward looking.", "The lags in monetary policy are long, and, therefore, the Committee has to base its decisions on how to set the federal funds rate looking into the future.", "Typically, we have seen that as long as inflation expectations are well anchored, that as  the labor market recove rs, we\u2019ll gradually see upward pressure on both wages and prices, and th at inflation will tend to move back toward 2 percent.", "I think historically we have see n, as the economy strengthens and slack diminishes, that inflation does tend to gr adually rise over time.", "And as long\u2014you know, I\u2014just speaking for myself, I will be looking for evidence that I think strengthens my confidence in that view and, you know, looking at the full range of data th at bear on whether or not that\u2019s a reasonable view of how events will unfold.", "But it\u2019s likely to be a decision  that\u2019s based on forecasts and confidence in the forecast.", "So, I think you raise a very important poin t because, although there is a great deal of market focus on the timing of liftoff, what to ma tter in thinking about the stance of policy is what the entire path of interest ra tes will look like.", "And I re ally don\u2019t have much for you other than to say that they will be data de pendent\u2014that, over time, the stance of policy will be adjusted to try to keep the economy on a tr ack where we see contin uing progress toward achieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability.", "There\u2019s\u2014you know, the federal funds rate has been sitting in the 0 to \u00bc percent range now for six years.", "This is\u2014and we have a very large balance sheet.", "We are pr oviding a very highly accommodative monetary policy.", "And even as we begin to normalize the stance of monetary polic y, when that becomes appropriate, it\u2019s important to remember that monetary policy will stil l be very accommodative for a long time.", "And as we begin to normalize policy, we will be looking  at unfolding economic developments.", "And as the economy strengthen s, and we come clos er to achieving our objectives, I think it\u2019s very likely that we w ill, you know, progress on the path of normalizing policy.", "So you\u2014your fi rst question is:  Why is it that the Committee sees unemployment as declining sligh tly below its estimate of the longer-run natura l rate?", "And, I think, in part, the reason for that is that in flation is running below our objective, and the Committee wants to see inflation move back towa rd our objective over time .", "And a short period of a very slight undershoot of unemployment below th e natural rate will facili tate a slightly faster return of inflation to our object ive.", "It is, I should say, a very small undershoot in a situation where there is great uncertainty about exactly  what constitutes maximum employment or a longer-run normal rate of unemployment.", "We also  do see the different measures of slack in the labor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is.", "The standard unemployment rate, for quite some time now, has b een signaling a little bit less slack in the labor market than measures that are somewhat broade r that, for example, include the unusually large number of people who were part-time employed but  would prefer full-time jobs.", "And the portion of the decline we\u2019ve seen in la bor force participation, that look s like it would disa ppear in a\u2014or be eroded in a stronger economy.", "And so it may be  that with a very small undershoot of this longer-run normal level of the unemployment ra te, as measured by the standard unemployment rate, we\u2019ll be seeing some further progress on those other margins of slack.", "But it\u2019s important to point out that the Committee is not anticipating an ove rshoot of its 2 percent inflation objective.", "December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL \u00a0Page 14 of 23 \u00a0 Oh, and longer-dated expectations.", "Well, wh at I would say, we refer to this in the statement as \u201cinflation compensation\u201d rather than  \u201cinflation expectations.\u201d  The gap between the nominal yields on 10-year Treasuries, for exam ple, and TIPS have declined\u2014that\u2019s inflation compensation.", "And five-year, five-year-forwards, as you\u2019ve said, have al so declined.", "That could reflect a change in inflati on expectations, bu t it could also reflect ch anges in assessment of inflation risks.", "The risk prem ium that\u2019s necessary to compen sate for inflation, that might especially have fallen if the proba bilities attached to very high in flation have come down.", "And it can also reflect liquidity effects in markets.", "And, for example, it\u2019s sometimes the case that\u2014when there is a flight to safety, that flight te nds to be concentrated in nominal Treasuries and could also serve to compress that spread.", "So I th ink the jury is out about exactly how to interpret that downward move in inflation compensation.", "And we indicated that we are monitoring inflation developments carefully.", "There is a wide range of opinion in the Committee.", "I think the statement does a good job of reflecting what the majority of the Committee th inks is appropriate policy.", "There certainly has been no, you know, decision on the part of the Committee to move at a meas ured pace or to use language like that.", "I think quite a few people, looking back on the use of th at language in the\u2014I can\u2019t remember if it was 12 or 16 meetings, where there were 25 basis point moves.", "We\u2019d probably not like to repeat a sequence in which there was a measured pace and 25 basis point moves at every meeting.", "Many members of the Committee, participants, ha ve said that they think policy should be based on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, wh ich tends to be variable over time, and that\u2019s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent.", "We have continued to provide guidance, the same guidance that we have for so me time, that says the Committee \u201canticipates that, even after employment and inflation ar e near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping th e target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\u201d   I know that\u2019s a mouthful, but it says, in eff ect, that the Committee believes that the economic conditions that have made recovery di fficult, we\u2019re getting beyond them.", "They see the longer-run normal level of interest rates as December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL \u00a0Page 16 of 23 \u00a0around 3\u00be percent.", "So there\u2019s no view in the Co mmittee that there is secular stagnation in the sense that we won\u2019t eventually get back to pretty historically normal levels of interest rates.", "But they have said, it\u2019ll, you know , the economy has required to get where it is a good deal of monetary policy accommodation; we expect to be  able to normalize policy.", "But, until those conditions have lifted that have held back economic activity, mone tary policy will need to stay accommodative.", "So, in that sense, perhaps that \u2019s equivalent to saying that the path of normalization is anticipated to be relatively gradua l.  But, again, the path of rates will depend on how economic conditions actually evolve, and that \u2019s nothing more than an expectation on the part of the Committee.", "Well, let me say that I th ink it\u2019s very important for the Federal Reserve System to have confidence in the quality  of its supervision.", "And I do have a good deal of confidence in the quality of our supervision program, fo r the banking organizations we December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL \u00a0Page 17 of 23 \u00a0supervise in general, and that also applies to  the largest banking organizations.", "We rely on examiners who are in the field and at the Re serve Banks to be provi ding information about what\u2019s happening in those organizations.", "But that  information feeds into a process in which it is not individuals at any single Reserve Bank.", "But,  at the Board, it\u2019s a Board-led process, and it involves senior officials at a number of different  Reserve Banks.", "It\u2019s also a multidisciplinary process that involves not only pe ople from supervision, but those from markets, from economic research.", "Experts who focus on financial stability all come together to evaluate the information that they have and to assign supe rvisory ratings and decide on th e appropriate program for all of those large institutions.", "We\u2019ve strengthened th e process of supervision enormously since the crisis, and I feel a very good sense of confidence in how we\u2019re carrying that out.", "An d when there are individuals who are examiners, who may disagree with others in their team about how to interpre t what\u2019s going on at a particular institution, it\u2019s important that ther e be channels by which they can make sure that disagreements are fed up to the highest levels.", "We do economic forecasting, and our\u2014the FOMC receives informati on to help us make decisions, but obviously there are disagreements about\u2014among economists a bout how to interpret developments.", "We\u2019ve announced that the Board has undertaken a review of whether or not there are appropriate mechanisms in place in all of th e Reserve Banks that individuals who disagree with decisions can make their own views known and feed into the process, and we\u2019ve also asked our inspector general to look into that.", "So let me simply say that Congress has assigned us  important tasks in monetary policy and in other role s that we perform, and the Fede ral Reserve is highly focused on attempting to carry out the mandates that Congress has given us in the area of monetary policy.", "It\u2019s our dual mandate to promote maximum empl oyment and price stability, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.", "You know, I would say that the ability of a central bank to make the decisions about monetary policy that it regards as  in the best longer-run interest s of the economy, free of short-run political interference,  is very important to the effective conduct of monetary policy.", "And I think that history shows, not onl y in the United States but arou nd the world, that central bank independence promotes better economic performan ce.", "So I do think central bank independence is very important, and that it\u2019s  important to make sure that we  can make the decisions we think are best, free of short-run political inte rference with respect to monetary policy.", "I believe strongly in transparency, and I believ e strongly that we shoul d communicate as clearly December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL \u00a0Page 19 of 23 \u00a0what we are doing and the rationale for doing it , and I am very open to looking for ways ourselves to improve our communications and tr ansparency, and working with Congress to do that.", "Back in 1978, Congr ess explicitly passed legislation to ensure that there would be no GAO audits of monetary policy decisionmaking\u2014 namely, policy audits.", "I cannot speak for the White House.", "Well, we certainly did review global economic developments, including developments in the Russian economy.", "Clearly, Russia has been hit very hard by the decline in oil prices, and the ru ble has depreciated enormously in  value, and this is posing a series of very difficult economic conditions in the Russian economy.", "Of course we discussed what the potential spi llovers are to the United States, which could occur both through trade and financia l linkages.", "December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL \u00a0Page 20 of 23 \u00a0Russia accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. trade volume, and U.S. banks\u2019 exposure to Russian residents is really quite small in terms of\u2014relative to their capit al.", "In terms of the portfolios of U.S. residents, there are Russian securities, but th ey are\u2014they account for a very small share.", "So I expect that the linkages back  to the spillovers to the United States, both through trade and financial channels, would be sm all.", "Europe, of course, is somewhat more exposed to Russia, both because Russia is an impor tant supplier of oil and natural gas to Europe and the financial linkages are somewhat greater.", "I mean, we have seen some impacts of lower oil prices on the spreads for high-yield bonds, where there\u2019s exposure to oil companies that may see distress or  a decline in their earnings, and we have seen some increase in spr eads on high-yield bonds more generally.", "I think for the banking system, as a whole, the exposure to oil\u2014I\u2019m not aware of significant issues there.", "This is the kind of thing that is part of risk management for banking organizations and the kind of thing they look at in stre ss tests.", "But the movements in oil prices have been very large and undoubtedly unexpected.", "December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL \u00a0Page 21 of 23 \u00a0We\u2014in terms of leverage, and whether or not levered entities could be badly affected by movements in oil prices, leverage in the financ ial system, in general, is way down from the levels before the crisis.", "There have be en large and unexpected movements in oil prices.", "So I agree, and that\u2019s why we  stated that we typically think of the monetary policy impact of our a sset purchases as depending on the stock of assets that we hold on our balance sheet rather than the flow of purchases, and so we \u2019re reminding the public that we continue to hold a large stock of assets, and that is tending to push down term premiums in longer-term yields.", "We made clear when we\u2014or  tried to make clear\u2014when we issued our normalization principles in September that we inte nd to use changes in our target for the federal funds rate as the main tool that we will actively use to adjust financial conditions.", "Rather than actively planning to sell the assets that we\u2019v e put onto our balance sheet, sometime after we begin raising our targets for s hort-term interest rates, depending on economic and financial conditions, we\u2019re likely to reduc e or cease reinvestment and gra dually run
