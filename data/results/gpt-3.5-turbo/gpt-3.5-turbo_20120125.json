["In my opening remarks I will briefly review today \u2019s policy decision by the Federal Open Market Committee .", "And then I \u2019ll discuss next the consensus statement that has been distributed to you regarding the  Committee \u2019s longer -run policy goals and strategy .", "And finally, I \u2019ll place today \u2019s policy decision in the context of our economic projections and our assessments of the appropriate path  of monetary policy .", "As indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time , is at levels consistent w ith our statutory mandate, the Committee  expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy .", "In particular, the Committee  decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to \u00bc percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least until late 2014 .", "To provide support for the recovery in the c ontext of price stability, the Committee  will also continue the program that we  announced in September to extend  the average maturity of the Federal Reserve\u2019s  holdings of securities .", "Following careful deliberations, Committee  participants have reached broad  agreement on a statemen t that sets forth our longer -run goals and policy strategy .", "This statement should not be interpreted as indicating any change in how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy .", "Rather, its purpose is to increase the transparency and predictability of policy .", "There is today widespread agreement that clear and transparent central bank communications fa cilitate well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduce economic and financial January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    2 of 29 uncertainty, increase the effectiveness of  monetary policy , and enhance accountability to the public .", "The statement begin s by noting the Committee \u2019s firm commitment to fulfill our statutory mandate of promoting maximum employment, stable prices , and moderate long -term interest rates .", "Since monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag, our decisions appropriately reflect the Committee \u2019s longer -run goals, our medium -term outlook, and our assessment of the balance of  risks , including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of o ur goals .", "An important aspect of policy transparency is clarity about policy objectives .", "With respect to the objective of price stability, it is essential to recognize that the  inflation rate over the longer  run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee  has the ability  to specify a longer -run goal for inflation.", "The Committee  judges that infl ation at the rate of 2 percent , as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer  run with our statutory  mandate.", "Over time, a higher inflation rate would reduce the public \u2019s ability to make accurate longer -term economic and financial decisions, whereas a  lower inflation rate would be associated with an elevated probability of falling into deflation , which can lead to significant economic problems .", "Clearly communicating to the public this 2 percent goal for inflation over the longer  run should help foster price stability and moderate long -term interest rates  and will enhance the Committee \u2019s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances .", "Maximum employment stands on an equal footing with price stability as an objective of monetary policy .", "A difference with price stability is that the maximum level of employme nt in a given economy is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    3 of 29 dynamics of the labor market , including demographic trends, the pace of technological innovation, and a variety of other influences , including a range of econo mic policies .", "Because monetary policy does not determine the maximum level of employment that the economy can sustain in the longer term, and since many of the determinants of maximum employment may change over time or may not be directly measurable, it i s not feasible for any central bank to specify a fixed goal for the longer -run level of employment .", "Although the Committee  cannot freely choose a longer -run goal for employment, it can estimate the level of maximum employment and use that estimate to inf orm its  policy decisions .", "The Committee  considers a wide range of indicators in  making its  assessments of maximum employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision over time .", "For example, in the latest set of  projections that have been distributed to you, Committee  partic ipants \u2019 estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment have a central tendency of 5.2 per cent to 6.0 percent \u2014roughly unchanged from last January but higher than the corresponding inte rval several years ago .", "As I noted, the level of maximum employment is not immutable ; in particular, it could be increased by effective polic ies, such as education  and training that improve work force skills .", "If the Committee \u2019s assessments pointed to an increase in the maximum attainable level of employment, our policy strategy would be modified appropriately to aim at the higher level .", "In setting monetary policy, the Committee  seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its mandate- consistent rate and deviations of employment from our assessments of its maximum level .", "These dual objectives are generally complementary .", "For example, under present circumstances, in which the unemployment rate is elevated and the inflation outlook is subdued, the Committee  judges that sustaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    4 of 29 consistent with promoting bot h objectives .", "And in the longer  term, low and stable inflation can help promote healthy growth in output and employment .", "Of course, circumstances may sometimes arise in which the dual objectives are not complementary .", "In such cases, the Committee  follows a balanced approach in promoting these two objectives, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and potentially different time horizons over which inflation and employment are projected to return to levels judged consistent with our mandate .", "In other words , the Committee always treat s its primary objectives of pric e stability and maximum employment symmetrically, and the stance of policy at any given time is determined by the size, social cost, and expected evolution of the deviations of each of the Committee \u2019s policy objectives from its desired level.", "I will now turn t o the economic projections of the 17 FOMC parti cipants \u2014that is , 5 Board members and 12  Reserve Bank presidents \u2014submitted in conjunction with today \u2019s meeting .", "The central tendencies and ranges of those projections for the years 20 11 to 2014 and over the longer  run are depicted in the figures that ha ve been distributed.", "The longer -run projections \u2014shown at the right of each figure \u2014represent participants \u2019 assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy .", "Incoming in formation suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately , notwithstanding some slowing in global growth.", "The Committee  expects the pace of economic growth to be , over  coming quarters \u2014to be moderate over  coming quarters, reflecting ongoing drags f rom the housing sector and still -tight credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses .", "Specifically, participants \u2019 projections for the growth rate of real gross domestic January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    5 of 29 product in 2012 have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.7 percent .", "Strains  in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to that outlook.", "Looking further ahead, economic activity is expected to acceler ate gradually in conjunction with strengthening consumer and business confidence, improving financial  conditions , and the  continuation of  a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy .", "Specifically, participants \u2019 GDP projections  for 2013 have a central tendency of 2.8 to 3.2 percent, and their projections for 2014 have a central tendency of 3.3 to 4.0 percent, noticeably higher than the central tendency of 2.3 to 2.6 percent  for their longer- run growth projections .", "A number of recent indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, but the unemployment rate remains el evated .", "Moreover, in light of the anticipated modest pace of economic recovery, the Committee  expects that over coming quarters the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward its mandate- consistent levels .", "Indeed, participants \u2019 projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency o f 8.2 to 8.5 percent  that is  little different from the latest monthly reading of 8.5 percent .", "With economic growth expected to pick up somewhat over time, the unemployment rate is expected to decline to 6.7 to 7.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014\u2014still well above partic ipants \u2019 estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment .", "I\u2019ll turn now to the outlook for inflation.", "The prices of oil and other commodities ha ve generally flattened out or turn ed downward over the past couple of quarters, while low levels of resource utilization have continued to constrain the growth of labor cost s.  Consequently, consumer price inflation \u2014which surged in the first half of last y ear\u2014has been subdued in recent months .", "Survey measures and financial market indicator s imply that longer -term inflation January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    6 of 29 expectations have remained stable.", "Over coming quarters, the Committee  anticipates that inflation will run at or below levels consiste nt with the mandate- consistent rate of 2 per cent.", "Specifically, participant s\u2019 inflation projections have a central tendency of 1.4 to 1.8 percent for 2012 and remain subdued at around 1\u00bd to 2 percent through 2014.", "As a further step in enhancing the clarity of our communications, the Committee  recently decided to begin publishing information about participants \u2019 assessments of appropriate monetary policy \u2014that is , the path of policy th at each participant judges as most  likely to foster mandate- consistent outcomes for employment and inflation if the economy evolves as expected.", "These judgments about  future policy underlie the participants \u2019 projections of growth, unemployment , and inflation that I just described.", "Rather \u2014excuse me\u2014 Importantly, these policy assessments should not be viewed as unconditional pledges .", "Rather , just as with our economic projections, these policy projections reflect the information available at the time of the forecast and are subject to future  revision in light of evolving economic and financial conditions .", "In the chart labeled \u201cA ppropriate T iming of P olicy F irming, \u201d each shaded bar indicates the number of Committee  participants who judge that the initial increase in the target federal funds rate would appropriately occur in the specified calendar year shown below the bar .", "Six participants anticipate that policy firming is likely to commence in 2015 or 2016, while five  others expect policy firming to commence in 2014 .", "The remai ning six  parti cipants judge that policy liftoff would be appropriate in 2012 or 2013 .", "\u201d  In that chart, the dots depict the distribution of participants \u2019 assessments regarding the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each of the next several years and over the longer  run.", "For example, based on current information, 11 participants expect that the January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    7 of 29 appropriate federal funds rate a t the end of 2014 will be at or below 1 percent , while 6 participants anticipate higher rates at that time .", "In effect, those judgments are reflected in today \u2019s meeting statement , in which the Committee  indicated that economic conditions \u201c are likely to war rant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.", "\u201d   As I have noted, we are also proceeding with the program that we announced in September to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve \u2019s holding of securities, t hereby fostering more  accommodative financial conditions without changing the overall size of the Federal Reserve\u2019 s balance sheet .", "The Committee  regularly reviews the size and composition of our securities holdings , and we will adjust those holdings as appropriate .", "In particular, the Committee  recognizes the  hardships imposed by high and persistent unemployment and  an underperforming economy , and it is prepared to provide further monetary accommodation if employment is not making sufficient progress towar d our assessment s of its maximum level or if inflation show s signs of  moving further below its mandate -consistent rate .", "We \u2019ve seen slightly better performance in the labor market , consumer sentiment has January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    8 of 29 improved, i ndustrial production has been relatively strong \u2014so there are some positive signs, no doubt .", "At the same time, we \u2019ve had mixed results in some other areas, such as retail sales , and we continue to see head winds emanating from Europe , coming from the slowing global economy and some other factors as well .", "We will, as I \u2019ve said in my statement, and as we have in fact in the FOMC statement, you know, we continue to review our holdings \u2014our portfolio holdings, securities , and we are prepared to take further steps in that directi on if we  see that the recovery\u2019s  faltering or if inflation is not moving toward target.", "We \u2019ve ke pt interest rates close to zero , we\u2019ve done two rounds of asset purchases , we have announced\u2014today , in fact \u2014an extension of January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    9 of 29 the period over which we expect to see rates very low , and our maturity extension program is still ongoing, so we maintain a quite accommodative path of policy at this point .", "I would further say that I think it\u2019 s important to emphasize that we \u2019re not going to mechanically take the interest rate projections that participants p rovide and just build policy off of that .", "I mean , it\u2019s still going to be necessary for the Committee  to exercise collective judgment , to consider the cost s and risks  of additional policy actions, to discuss the uncertainty about the forecast and other factors that come into the policy decision.", "Now, all that being said, if inflation is going to remain below target for an extended period, and unemployment progress is very slow, then I think your implicit question is right, t here is a case for additional policy action , and we \u2019ll\u2014you know, we want to continue to observe the situation, but we \u2019re certainly prepared to look for different ways to provide support to the economy if , in fact , we have this unsatisfactory situation .", "Well, there are a number of factors that make us expect inflation to be quite low in the next couple of years .", "Certainly, we are seeing a reversal , or at least a  flattening out, of the commodity price increases that caused headline inflation to rise earlier in 2011.", "And the futures markets , and  our own estimates of supply and demand globally with the slowing global economy , suggest that most likely \u2014although, of course , there \u2019s a lot of uncertainty \u2014that commodity prices will remain well controlled over the next couple of years .", "January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    10 of 29 On top of that , of course , we have a very high rate of unemployment ; pressure on wages is quite restrained .", "And putting that t ogether with strong productivity gains, the cost s of production\u2014unit labor costs \u2014are growing very slowly .", "Expectations of inflation seem well anchored  and, in fact, have been on the low side relative to recent history in recent months .", "So for all those reasons, inflation looks to be at or modestly below th e 2 percent target going forward.", "With respect to the maximum employment measure, we provided a \u2014we h ave been providing , in fact , for four years , as long as we\u2019ve been provi ding the economic projections \u2014an estimate of the long-run sustainable rate of unemployment , which is currently \u2014the central tendency is currently 5.2 to 6 percent .", "That is higher than it was a couple of years ago, reflecting structural impediments and other changes .", "We \u2019re concerned that the large amount of long -term unemployment may be causing some workers to lose skills or lose labor force attachment, which, at least for a while , will also likely increase the so -called natural rate, or sustainable rate, of unemployment .", "But in any case, while there \u2019s certainly a lot of uncertainty about exactly where the natural  rate of unemploy ment is, clearly , at 8\u00bd percent, I think we \u2019re comfortably above anybody \u2019s estimate , and for that reason, we still consider the labor market to be obviously quite slack.", "Well, your first que stion \u2014our ability to forecast three and four years out is obviously very limited , there\u2019 s no question about that .", "Nevertheless, we have to make a best guess, a provisional plan, in the same way that  a firm making  an investment has to make a best guess or provisional plan about where the economy and the industry is going to be over a number of years .", "And s o it\u2019s certainly possible that we will be either too optimistic or too pessimi stic, in which case we\u2019 ll have to adjust both our forecasts and our policy expectations .", "That being said, you know, currently, the zero  lower bound on policy rates \u2014at least according to many estimates \u2014is still binding ; that is, even if the economy were a bit stronger, the very low interest rates we currently have would still be valid, still be appropriate .", "And so for that reason, unless there \u2019s a substantial stren gthening of the economy in the near  term, I would think that it \u2019s a pretty good guess that we  will be keeping rates low for some time from now .", "We don\u2019 t identify the specific individuals who provide the projections .", "Among other reasons, we want to make sure that people come to the meeting willing to talk and not be wedded to a specific position, and that \u2019s why , again , the Committee  makes a collective decision after using as input these projections , which are circulated to all the members of the Committee  before the meeting so that they can see what their colleagues believe.", "As far as what indivi dual members do believe, we certainly have other vehicles for expressing our views .", "All of us give speeches, all of us give interviews and are \u2014you know, I give frequent testimony, so there  are plenty of opportunities to get a sense of what individual members believe.", "But again, we felt that this information , which presents both the diversity of views in the Committee  but also shows where the central tendencies lie,  would be useful .", "And I guess I might add to that, you know, the January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    12 of 29 Chairman \u2019s term is not inf inite and a t some point there \u2019ll be a new C hairman, but there \u2019s a lot more continuity on the FOMC collectively .", "The average Bank president is on the FOMC for a s much as 10 years and G overnors \u2019 terms  are 14 years .", "So even as the C hairman changes, much of the FOMC remains continuous .", "So, as we talk about interest rates in 2014, the fact that there is quite wide -ranging agreement that interest rates will be low for a long time, should give you more confidence that that \u2019s not dependent on a single individual .", "We cannot cont rol, of course , where inflation  and unemployment are at each moment in time , and so there will be periods when, for reasons outside of our control, inflation and unemployment will move away from their desired levels .", "If\u2014In those situations, the speed at which \u2014I think \u201c tolerate\u201d  might be too s trong of a word , because we always want to get everything , both sides of the mandate, back to their desired levels \u2014but the speed at which we would enforce that return would depend on what \u2019s happening with the other variable .", "So, for January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    13 of 29 example, if inflation did go above target by a modest amount, we would certainly try to get it back down to target , but if unemployment were very high, that would lead us to be more cautious and slower in returning to target .", "So that \u2019s why \u201c medium  term \u201d\u2014which is , these targets  are all medium  term \u2014is a flexible concept , and it depends on the initial conditions, how far away the two key variables are from their objectives at the beginning of the process .", "I have a job to do, a nd as long as I \u2019m here, I will do everything I can to help the Federal Reserve achieve its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.", "In the case of savers, you know, we think about all these issues , and we certainly recognize that  the low interest rates that we \u2019re using to try to stimulate investment and expansion of the economy also impose a cost on savers who have a lower return .", "I guess the response I would make  is that the savers in our economy are dependent on a healthy economy in order to get adequate returns .", "In particular, people ow n stocks and corporate bonds and ot her securities as well as , say, T reasury securities , and if our economy is in really bad shape, then January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    14 of 29 they are not going to get good returns on those investments .", "So I think what we need to do, as is often the case when the economy goes into a very weak situation, then low interest rates are needed to help re store the economy to something closer to full employment and to increase growth and that , in turn, will lead  ultimately to higher return s across all assets for savers and investors .", "But again, you know, w e recognize that during periods like this, savers are getting a lower return .", "One reason why it \u2019s extremely important for us to maintain price stability, of course, is that at least that minimizes any loss es due to inflation that savers might suffer .", "Well, you\u2019 re referring , I think, to the 165\u2013166 rules , which will focus on the supervisory over sight of the largest banks .", "The notion of the surcharges is that banks which do not pose  significant threats to the systemic stability of Unites States, you know, should not have a significant surcharge .", "We\u2019re required to consider these issues by Dodd\u2013 Frank, but our view is that i t\u2019s the largest banks, the ones whose failure would endanger our financial system , that should be subject to these surcharges  because , first \u2014because we need to have them be safer than smaller banks , and secondly, because we want to try to equalize the cost of credit tha t they face .", "In other words, a bank which is thought to be too big to fail gets an artificial subsidy in the interest rate that it can borrow at , and by having additional c apital  requirements , that tends to equalize the cost of funding to different banks and reduces the incentive of banks to get large just to cr eate the impression of being too big to fail .", "The B asel Committee  has provided some sense of the range of what those surcharges will fall into , and so we \u2019re still working o n defining exactly the criteria , but you can assume th at it will be a fairly continuous  range between the $50 billion banks and the very largest banks in our economy .", "So we will be providing , in our minutes and in our S urvey of Economic P rojections , which will be released in three weeks \u2014we \u2019ll be providing some additional qualitative information about peoples \u2019\u2014participants \u2019 views of the balance sheet going forward .", "The reason that I can \u2019t provide all that information now is basically that we received, you know, a whole range of qualitative comments , and we had further discussion during the meeting yesterday and today , and so, you know, we \u2019re going to need a little time to summarize that and to have it approved by, you know \u2014the minutes , of course , and the  SEP are approved by the entire Committee \u2014and so, in that respect , it will be a definitive statement about what we currently know about the balance sheet .", "You know , one is that it certainly remains \u2014ex panding the balance sheet  certainly remains an option , one that we would consider very seriously if \u2014in particular , if progress toward full employment was continued, or it became more, inadequate , or if inflation remained  exceptionally low .", "I can make one additional point , which  maybe wasn \u2019t obvious, which is that , in June , we provided some principles relating the sales of assets \u2014ultimate sales of assets \u2014to the path of interest rates, and those remain \u2014those principles remain in force .", "And so one implication of our extension of our expected point of take off to late 2014 is to imply that the initial sales from our balance sheet, which again are far down the road but \u2014that begins \u2014that will be later than previously thought .", "So we do expect to hold our balance sheet at a high level for a longer period.", "Additional sales again \u2014I\u2019m sorry \u2014Additional purchases remains a topic that we January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    17 of 29 are still debating , and it will depend both on our assessment of the efficacy and the risks of that particular tool , but als o of how the economy is evolving.", "Well, again, first I want to emphasize that there is no mechanical relationship between these projections and the outcomes of the FOMC decisions .", "If you want to draw lines, I guess I would\u2014 I guess my suggestion would be to look at the median, the middle of the distribution , because we do have a democratic process in the Committee , and so the median would give you some se nse of where the weight balances against higher \u2014in favor of higher or lower rates .", "Again, we did note that in support of our assessment of late 2014, which is a Committee  decision , and of course there was a 9- to-1 vote in favor of that, but that is supported by the observation that 11 of the 17 participants expect the funds rate at the end of 2014 to be 1 percent or l ess, and so presumably the take off would not be much earlier than that .", "In terms of future additions, there are a lot of ways we could go.", "W e could provide, for example, more relationship s between \u2014more information about the relationship between individuals \u2019 policy preferences and their forecasts , and so on.", "We have a very capable sub committee , which is charged with continual assessment and analysis of possible ways of improving our transparency .", "Well , the Feder al Reserve obviously has a very strong interest in the housing sector .", "The weakness of the housing sector is an important reason why the economy is not recovering more robustly, and the problems in housing finance are part of the reason why monetary polic y has not been more powerful \u2014because part of our transmission mechanism is through lower interest rates , which affects refinancing ; it affects sales and purchases as well .", "So, in addition to that, as bank supervisors, we have considerable interest in servicing, in loan modifications, in delinquencies , and all the aspects of mortgage lending .", "So we have a considerable interest in this area, and as you say , we did a white paper , which looked January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    19 of 29 at a number of issues , including refinancing and mortgage finance .", "I think it \u2019s important to say that our intent in that white paper was to provide the benefit of our analysis to the public and to those who will be making policy .", "We did not take specific stands on individual issues .", "I would say that there \u2019s a variety of views about principal forgiveness within the Federal Reserve System , and there is n o official position.", "There are also some potential drawbacks ; one of them is the fact that the amount of negative equity in the United States is about $700 billion, which is enormous, and so there is no conceivable program that is going to put ever ybody in the country above water .", "Well, whenever the Fed takes a policy action , there\u2019s always some potential for a signal.", "I mean, that \u2019s true not just in these current times , but anytime the Fed lowers or increases interest rates, and that \u2019s something we have to think about .", "But I think, generally speaking, that those considerations  are outweighed by the need to maintain accommodative financial conditions  so that it\u2019 s attractive to firms to invest and hire, attractive for those who are eligible to buy homes, and so on, and I think that that ultimately is more powerful than the signal  from the change in policy .", "In particular , the markets and the news media are very good at picking up the underlying economic data and making assessments of the state of the economy and reporting what different people think about the economy, so I wouldn\u2019 t overstate the Fed \u2019s ability to massively change expectations through its statements, for example .", "So, again, I think that while we certainly take that into account, we think it \u2019s important for us to say what we think, and we think it \u2019s important for us to provide the right amount of stimulus to try to help our economy recover from its currently underutilized condition.", "Just since August we have put a date on our expected period of low interest rates .", "Today we announced a January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    21 of 29 further extension of the expected pe riod of low rates .", "By issuing this  expected policy rate information, we hope to convey to the market the extent to which there is support on the Committee  for maintaining rates at a low level for a significant time .", "So, you know, I don\u2019 t accept the premise that we\u2019 ve been passive ; we\u2019ve been actually quite active in our policy , and in one respect, the low level of inflation is a validation in the following  sense , that there were some who we re very concerned that our balance sheet policies and the like would lead to high inflation .", "There\u2019 s certainly no sign of that yet , and it hasn \u2019t shown up either in financial m arkets or in outside forecaster s\u2019 expectatio ns.", "Now that being said, as I mentioned earlier, if the situation continues , with inflation below target and unemployment declining at a rate which is very, very slow, then more \u2014our framework, the logic of our framework, says  we should be looking for ways  to do more .", "It\u2019s not completely straightforward because, of course, we \u2019re now dealing with a variety of nonstandard policy tools \u2014we can \u2019t just lower the federal funds rate 25 basis points like in the good old days \u2014but your basic point is right , that, you know, we need to adopt policies that will both achieve our inflation objectives and help the economy recover as quickly as  is feasible.", "A nd, I would say that your question\u2014actually , an earlier question \u2014shows a benefit of explaining this framework because  the framework makes very clear that we need to be thinking about ways in which we can provide further stimulus if we don\u2019 t get some improvement in the pace of recovery and a normalization of inflation .", "So, a literal reading of price stability would say inflation should be at zero.", "There are probably some measurement biases and other issues that mean that a measured value of inflation above zero is probably consistent with stable prices .", "But as we \u2019ve talked about frequently, we set inflation \u2014our inflation objective in a way that was consistent with both sides of the mandate :  price stability \u2014and 2 percent is low enough that we believe that it\u2019s not going to extensively interfere with financial planning and economic planning on the pa rt of households and businesses \u2014but also in the interest of employment .", "A target for inflation that was zero would have seve ral consequences .", "And we \u2019ve seen in many instances that deflation can be bad for economic performance and bad for employment , and , therefore, setting an inflation target at zero would be not  consistent with the other part of our mandate .", "Incidentally, related t o that, a zero inflation rate would mean that nominal interest rates would be at very low levels, typically 2 to 3 percent or whatever they might be , and that would increase the risk and probability that we would be in a  situation like today where we reall y can \u2019t cut the short -term interest rate any further .", "So I think there are good reasons from a dual -mandate perspective to have inflation greater than 2 percent .", "And I would add that , you know, if you look at central banks around the world, whether they are nominal inflation targeters or not, that 2 percent is basically the number that most central banks January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    23 of 29 use; the ECB, many other central banks either us e 2 percent or a range around 2  percent .", "So this is not at all different from what many other central banks do .", "Now, are we inflation targeters ?", "If by \u201c inflation targeter \u201d you mean a central bank that puts top priority on inflation and other goals , like employment, as subsidiary goals , then the answer is no .", "We are a dual -mandate central bank :  We put equal weight on price stability and maximum employment;  those are the goals given to us by the Congress .", "And so, in that respect, as I mentioned earlier , I think, to Greg, we \u2019re not absolutists :  If there \u2019s a need to let inflation return a little bit more slowly to target in order to get a better result in employment, then that \u2019s something that we would be willing to do .", "Having said all that, I think it\u2019 s worth noting that even banks that \u2014central banks that call themselves inflation targeters typically pay at least some attention to other parts of the economy :  employment , growth, financial stability , and the like .", "So I don\u2019 t think there \u2019s really any central bank , or very few , at least , that focus only on inflation.", "But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve because we are going to be evenhanded in  treating the price stability and maximum employment parts of our mandate on a level footin g.   ZACHARY GOLDFA", "I think there \u2019s some uncertainty about where the economy is going , and we want to continue to observe how the economy is developing .", "But I would say that, as I \u2019ve said on several \u2014in several answers, that if recovery continues to be modest and progress on unemployment very slow , and if inflation appears to be likely to be below target for a number of years out \u2014so the configuration we \u2019re talking about in the projections \u2014then I think there would be a very strong case , based on our framework, for finding a different \u2014additional tools for expansionary policies or to support the economy .", "We are in a difficult situation in terms of the effectiveness of policy tools .", "My own view , thinking about the effects, for example, of additional purchases \u2014additional securities purchases, I\u2019ve been pretty satisfied in the sense that \u2014in the following sense, that purchases do seem to have the desired effects on f inancial conditions :  They tend to ease financial conditions, they tend to lower interest rates, they tend to strengthen asset prices .", "And those are exactly the kinds of things that monetary policy normally does in order to try to provide stableness to the economy .", "What has been a bit more uncertain is the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism .", "And we have seen some developments in the economy that have probably weakened the effectiveness of policy , including , notably , the housing sector , where one would expect \u2014with mortgage rates below 4 percent, one would expect to see more ac tivity than we \u2019ve been seeing .", "And the problems in housing finance and so on are part of the reason that the  expansionary stimulus is not feeding through as much as we would like to the real economy .", "No, I think we still have tools , but we need to January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    25 of 29 further analyze and study those tools and try to make comparisons in terms of effectiveness, risks , and the like .", "I might have commented on Zach\u2019 s question that our two main tools at this point \u2014given that short -term interest  rates  are close to zero \u2014are asset purchases, but the other is communications .", "And to  the extent that we can communicate that rates will be lower for longer, that will ease financial conditions and be a way that we can affect the state of the economy .", "The reason that we just don\u2019 t release the economic projections and leave it at that is because, while the economic projections of future policy  rates are an important input to our policy discussions around the table, the decision ultimately is made by the Federal Open Market Committee , you know, which is the voters sitting around the table, and in a  process by which we exchange ideas and make arg uments and come to a collective determination .", "So, you know, we don\u2019 t set the federal funds interest rate by having members send in their vote and not having a meeting ; we have a meeting for a reason, which is to talk to each other and try to come to some  kind of consensus .", "So the FOMC will always, in some sense, trump the projections of forward interest January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    26 of 29 rates , but clearly, because the participants and the people around the table are the same, the projections  should give significant information about wher e the FOMC is likely to go .", "The FOMC stated that global growth has slowed and, of course , that is weighing on financial conditions in the U.S .", "Arguably, one way that the Federal Reserve could help would be by extending a loan to the International Monetary Fund.", "There have been other central banks that have  been doing that when the government was reluctant to do so, and we have all noted that the  Fed was not shy when it came to extending loans to international financial institutions, private banks, and so on that are based or that have subsidiaries in the U.S .", "Is it something that you could consider if the sovereign debt crisis got worse?", "Well, we chose the PCE index for  some , I think, very valid technical reasons .", "It better allows \u2014better accounts for changes in people \u2019s purchasing patterns ; you know, when some  things become more expensive, people will tend to move to other types of goods and services .", "That \u2019s not accounted for by the CPI , which has fixed weight s.  It also \u2014the PCE \u2014I think more relevant to the average person , the PCE includes all health -care costs, not just out -of-pocket cost s, and that has two benefits .", "One is , it reduces the share of the inflation index  which is tied to housing .", "And the CPI ha s a very large share devoted to housing , and a large share of that part of the index is imputed\u2014t hat is , essentially made- up numbers .", "So that\u2019s one benefit , to keep the \u2014you know, not  to put too much weight on the imputed housing numbers , which is part of the C", "Well, as you know, the Federal Reserve makes it a policy to try to avoid commenting on specific individual tax and spending programs , and I don\u2019 t have those numbers at hand in any case .", "But what I would say is the fol lowing \u2014is that what I \u2019ve tried to convey to Congress , and I think many other economists have taken the same view, is that responsible fiscal policy has at least two components at this point .", "One is , of course , importantly , to achieve fiscal sustainability .", "And to achieve fiscal sustainability over a long period of time , we need to be acting soon \u2014now  would be preferable \u2014to making credible commitments to reducing spending, to improving our programs, to modifying or simplifying our tax code, and so on, s o as the ways that will be persuasive to the markets or to the public that over the longer term, over the next 10, 20, 30 years , that our fiscal position will be sustainable .", "I think it \u2019s important to take steps at least to \u2014again, the specific steps are up to Congress , but it \u2019s important that action be taken to provide a credible plan to achieve fiscal sustainability .", "The second part of my recommendation, though, is that we need at this juncture to be sensitive to the effects of whatever policy decisions are made on what is still a very fragile recovery .", "Again, there are many ways to do that , but I think that should be taken in to account as people are looking at policy al ternatives in terms of taxes or spending .", {"sentence": "In my opening remarks I will briefly review today \u2019s policy decision by the Federal Open Market Committee .", "label": 2, "reason": "NEUTRAL\nThe sentence does not provide any indication of a hawkish or dovish stance.
