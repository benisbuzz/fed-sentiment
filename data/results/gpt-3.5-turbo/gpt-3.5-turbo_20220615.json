warranted at this meeting , and today we delivered that in the form of a 75 basis point rate hike , as I mentioned.", "So the point of it, really , is this :  We\u2019ve been moving rates up

would put us , at the end of the July meeting , in that range \u2014in that more normal range , and that \u2019s a desirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the

.", "But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3 \u00bd percent.", "Then you\u2019 re looking at next year , and what you\u2019 re seeing is, people see more \u2014a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3\u00bd to 4 percent.", "And that \u2019s generally what June 15, 2022   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 8 of 27   people see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and getting back down to 2 percent.", "So  75 basis points seemed like the right thing to do at this meeting , and that \u2019s what we did.", "So the question really is , how high does the rate really need to go?", "And this is \u2014the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3 \u00bd to 4 percent.", "Well, you can think about the longer -run

effect they \u2019re having on the economy, rates, asset prices, credit spreads\u2014all of those things go into that.", "You can also look at the yield curve and ask, all along the yield curve, where

have confidence that we have the tools and will use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time.", "It will take some time , we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that.", "So, as I mentioned , I think , in my opening statement, inflation has started \u2014it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic -related areas , and it \u2019s spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well .", "It was really in the  goods  sector at the beginning.", "S ome of that will be pass-through of  energy prices , but it \u2019s\u2014so you\u2019 re experiencing services inflation.", "Shelter inflation is high.", "We see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels, which would be, in the thinking of the Committee, somewhere in the range of 3 to 3\u00bd percent by year -end.", "If you see\u2014you\u2019 re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent .", "That would be \u2014I would call that as meeting that test.", "Like I said , though, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created great challenges.", "A nd, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it \u2014there \u2019s a much bigger chance now that it \u2019ll depend on factors that we don\u2019 t

on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which we think is essential for the b enefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic.", "So, as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over the last seven months, and that \u2019s a good thing, we think.", "But the f ederal f unds r ate, even after this increase , is at 1.6 percent.", "So it \u2019s hard to see how that is too high of a rate .", "Still, that\u2019 s still a low rate.", "So that \u2019s not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession on.", "As I mentioned a couple times, the Committee \u2019s views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which will be in the 3 to 3\u00bd percent range by the end of this yea r, but that \u2019s conditioned on that being the appropriate thing to do.", "If we see data going in a different direction, it \u2019ll be reflected in our policy , as you see today.", "And I would say,  this is a highly uncertain environment \u2014extraordinarily uncertain environment.", "So, again, we \u2019ll be determined and resolved, but flexible.", "So, of course , we\u2019ve been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent.", "We\u2014it\u2019s hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that

forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let \u2019s call it that, globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity.", "It\u2019s a very flat Philips curve wor

inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China \u2014the war in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here.", "So we \u2019re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy \u2014we have been , obviously, for quite a while .", "Inflation is behaving dif ferently , and,  in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand.", "B ut you couldn \u2019t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that.", "In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the June 15, 2022   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 26 of 27   old world, or are we really going to be in a world where major supply shocks go on and on?", "The history is , you see these waves of supply shocks, as you did in the \u2019 70s, and then they go away, and sort of there \u2019s a \u201cnew normal ,\u201d and things settle down.", "In the meantime , we have to find price stability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where , clearly , inflationary forces are \u2014you \u2019re seeing them everywhere.", "Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it \u2019s absolutely extraordi nary.", "In fact, we \u2019re sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have , of course , a different kind of inflation than other people have , partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recover ed.", "We\u2019ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and\u2014sorry, on QT, we \u2019ve communicated really clearly to the markets about what we\u2019 re going to do there.", "Markets seem to be okay with it.", "We \u2019re phasing in\u2014Treasury [security] issuance is down quit e a lot, quite a lot from where it\u2019s been, so I have no reason to think\u2014markets are forward looking , and they see this coming.", "So rates were very low \u2014a good place to start is that rates were very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could June 15, 2022   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL  Page 27 of 27   to support the economy when unemployment was 14 percent and the true unempl oyment rate was well higher than that.", "A nd that was a \u2014rates a re low , and now they\u2019 re coming back up to more normal , or above , levels.", "So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while  demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wa nting to live in urban areas to some extent to living in single -family homes in the suburbs, famously.", "A nd so the demand was just suddenly much higher.", "And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years.", "So that changes now , and rates have moved up\u2014we \u2019re well aware that mortgage rates have moved up a lot \u2014and you\u2019 re seeing a changing housing market.", "How much will it really affect residential investment?", "How much will  it affect housing prices?", "You would think over time \u2014I mean , so there \u2019s a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes , and as those come on  line\u2014whereas the supply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale , is incredibly low, historically low.", "So it \u2019s still a very tight market.", "So prices may keep going up for a while even in a world where rates ar e up.", "We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again.", "S o this will be a process whereby we \u2014ideally , we do our work in a way
