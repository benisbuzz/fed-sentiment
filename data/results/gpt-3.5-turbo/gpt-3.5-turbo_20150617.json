federal  funds rate.", "And what should matt er to market participants is the entire trajectory, the entire expected trajectory of policy.", "A nd, again, while our actual policy decisions will have to evolve in  light of what really does happ en in the economy, the Committee, as you can see by the SEP projections , currently anticipates th at conditions will evolve in the economy in a manner that will make  it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate gradually over time.", "Well, it\u2019 s a judgment that the Committee is\u2014will  have to make, and, as I\u2019ve said previously and as we \u2019ve said in the statement, it will depend on a wide range of data and not on any simple indicators .", "So I can\u2019t provide you\u2014it wo uld be wrong for me to provide you a roadmap that said something as simple as, if the unemploy ment rate declines to X, that then the labor market will ha ve improved enough for us to begin  to raise policy.", "Obviously, we have to look at the pace of job creation.", "We hav e to look at what\u2019s happening to labor force particip ation, to part-time employment  for economic reasons, to job openings, to the pace of quits, t o wage inflation, and other in dicators of the state of the labor market.", "I did say when we agreed that labor market slack has d iminished to some extent in the intermeeting period, and, clearl y, over a longer span of time, over the last several years, obviously we\u2019ve made considerab le progress in moving toward our  goal of maximum employment.", "So, in spite of the f act that there is some progre ss on that front, the Committee wants to see some further progre ss before feeling that it will be appropriate to raise rates.", "On inflation, again, there has b een some progress, in the sense  energy prices appear to have stabilized.", "Now, inflati on is going to\u2014overall inflation is likely to run at a low level for a substantial period of time.", "The  big declines in energy prices came toward the end of last year and the beginning of this year , and they\u2019re not going to wash o ut of the inflation data until late in this year.", "But the fact that en ergy prices have stabilized mea ns that the pressure from that source is diminishing.", "June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 8 of 23  In addition, the dollar appears to have largel y

marke t continues to improve and as our confidence in that forecast rise s, at least for me, my confiden ce will also rise that inflation will move back up toward 2 percent.", "I e xpect that to, over time, pu t upward pressure on core inflation.", "Okay, so on the f irst question you asked about t he 2004\u201306 rate increase cycle.", "Throughout that  period, the Fed indicated that  rates would rise at a measured pace, and that turned out to be, I believe, 17 meetings, with 2 5 basis point increases at each meeting.", "As I\u2019ve emphasized, previously, we have\u2014absolutely do  not expect to follow any mechanical 25 basis points a meeting, 25 basis point every othe r meeting, no plan to follow any type of mechanical approach to r aising the federal funds rate.", "You June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 9 of 23  know, conceivably, I think, with t he benefit of hindsight, it m ight have been better to raise rates more rapidly or more duri ng the 2004\u201306 cycle.", "We place high priorit y on being an accountable and tr ansparent central bank, and I think that if you compare the t ransparency of monetary policy d ecisions in the Federal Reserve with other central banks, we are  one of the most transparent ce ntral banks in terms of the information that we provide to t he public in a whole variety of  ways.", "So let me start w ith the balance sheet and our r einvestment policy.", "We issued a normalization state ment giving principles of normal izing policy, and what we said at that time is that we expected  to reduce or cease reinvestmen t at some time after we had begun the process of normalizing polic y by raising our target for the  federal funds rate.", "We said the timing of that would depend on economic and financial condition s, and the Committee has really not made any further decisions  about how it\u2019s going to go about  doing that, so President Dudley was expressing his own personal po int of view.", "But this is a m atter that the Committee has not yet decided, and I can\u2019t provide  any further detail.", "The last paragraph of the Federal Ope n Market Committee statement s ays:  \u201cThe Committee currently anticipates that, eve n after employment and inflation  are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping  the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee view s as normal in the longer run.\u201d  That\u2019s kind of a mouthful.", "It\u2019s a long sentence, but I think the s pirit of that sentence is con sistent with my use of the word \u201cgradual,\u201d and it is consistent  with what you see in the Summar y of Economic Projections.", "Participants are projecting\u2014obvious ly there is a lot of uncerta inty, but they\u2019re projecting increases that average ar ound 100 basis points per year.", "Now, that\u2019s not a promise, it\u2019s conditional on their economic forecasts, and those forecasts ma y prove to be wrong and may change.", "But at this time, the assessmen t that participants have of the economy suggest to them that the appropriate pace of normalization to keep the economy on track to meet our objectives will be gradual, in that sense.", "So your first qu estion was about a rate i ncrease this year.", "You know, again, the Committee tries to  give an indication in the S ummary of Economic Projections about how economic conditions will unfold, their best projectio ns of that and what the appropriate policy will be give n in light of those expectations .", "And, clearly, most participants are anticipating that a rate increase this  year will be appropr iate.", "Now, that assumes, as you can s ee, that they\u2019re expecting a pic kup in growth in the second half of this year and furth er improvement in labor marke t conditions.", "But, agai n, the important point is, no decision has been made by the Committee about what the right timing is o f an increase.", "In terms the IMF guidance, you know , I believe the IMF plays a very useful role by undertaking reviews of the econom ic policies of all of its memb ers.", "Obviously, there is a range of opinion among outside observers a nd market participants as w ell as among the Committee\u2019s participants, as you can see in the SEP, about how economic con ditions are likely to unfold and, consequently, the appropriate ti ming of an initial rate hike.", "I think, however, we all agree, and the IMF agrees, that policies should be data dependent, and the  Committee is always doing its best to assess the implicati ons of incoming data.", "But, again, I want to emph asize\u2014and I think the IMF would agree with this\u2014that the impor tance of the timing of a first de cision to raise rates is something that should not be overb lown, whether it\u2019s September or Decembe r or March\u2014what matters is the entire path of rates.", "And, as I\u2019ve said, the Committee ant icipates economic conditions that would call for a gradual evolut ion of the fed funds rate toward  normalization.", "With respect to international sp illovers, this is something tha t we have been long attentive to.", "Obviously, we have to put in pl ace a policy that is approp riate to evolving conditions in the U.S. economy, but we can\u2019t promise that there will not be volat ility when we make a decision to raise rates.", "What we can do is to do our very best to communic ate clearly about our policy and our expectations to avoid any type  of needless misunderstanding  of our policy that could create volatility in the market and potential spillovers as well to em erging markets, and I have been trying to do that now for some ti me.", "I think our experien ce suggests that it\u2019s hard t o have great confidence in predicting what the market reaction will be to Fed decisions , and there have been surprises in the past.", "And all I can say is that uncerta inty in the markets at this po int about long-term rates doesn\u2019t appear to be unusually high, and w e can only do what is in our power to attempt to minimize needless volatility that could have repercussions for other cou ntries or for financial stability more generally, and that is to attempt to communicate as clearly as we can about our policy decisions, what they will depend on, and what we are looking at.", "And I think it\u2019s clear that the market is als o responding to incoming data, and you can see that in daily market reactions to surprises in t he economic data.", "And, of course, n one of us can quite forecast what incoming data will be.", "So we are\u2014productiv ity growth has been\u2014is a fact or that affects the pace of improvement in the labor  market.", "Productivity growth h as been extremely slow for the June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference FINAL  Page 14 of 23  last couple of years, and I think, in part, the pace of improve ment in the labor market that we\u2019re projecting reflects th e notion that there\u2019s likely to be some p ickup in the pace of productivity growth.", "Obviously, that\u2019s someth ing that\u2019s quite uncertain, an d it\u2019s conceivable that if productivity growth disappoints\u2014 something I hope that we won\u2019t see, because that has very negative implications  for living standards\u2014we could conceivably  see faster improvement in the labor market.", "But, in addition, there are other margins of slack that don\u2019t s how up in the unemployment rate.", "Labor force participation that has, at least,

continue, and I would ex pect also to see some improvement in the degree of part-time employ ment that\u2019s for economic reaso ns.", "So the Committee es timates that the longer-run n ormal level of the unemployment rate is 5.0 to 5.2.", "A t 5.5 percent, where we have  an unemployment rate that still exceeds the Committee\u2019s best attempts to estimate what is a nor mal unemployment rate for
