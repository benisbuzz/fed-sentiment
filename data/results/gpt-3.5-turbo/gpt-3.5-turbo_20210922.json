goals is the test for beginning the taper.", "So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it \u2019s what we adopted last September.", "It \u2019s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment.", "And while we have interesting signs that , in many ways , the labor market\u2019 s very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market, and we think that those imbalances will sort themself out.", "Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it, September 22, 2021 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 9 of 27   moderately higher inflation over 2 percent \u2014you know, that really depends on the path of inflation.", "If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff.",

suggests a very strong labor market.", "And I think they\u2019 re writing down in good faith what they see as meeting the test.", "There \u2019s a range of perspectives about where the economy will be, but \u2014by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023.", "And that \u2019s why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible

and sell financial assets.", "And that \u2019s the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting.", "So, you know, I would have had to go back and read people \u2019s financial disclosures to know what their activities have been.", "This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess you\u2019d say it \u2019s served us well.", "You know, I personally owned municipal securities for many, many years, and in 2019, I froze that.", "Meaning I \u2014they\u2019re no\u2014 I\u2019m holding all those securities, my wife and I, to maturity.", "And munis were always thought  to be a pretty safe place for a Fed  person to invest because, as you know, the lore was that the Fed  would never buy municipal securities.", "And so then comes the, you know, the COVID crisis, and I reversed that policy, a nd I did it without hesitating.", "And the reason was that the financial markets, including the municipal financial market, were very much on the verge of collapse.", "But this, again, comprehensive and deliberate process\u2014we \u2019re going to make changes.", "I want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this c hallenge and handled the situation well, and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public \u2019s interest and the institution that we \u2019re all a part of.", "So , you\u2019 re right, we have a \u2014really , I\u2019ll call it a unique situation where , by many measures , the labor market is tight.", "And 11 million job openings, very widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it \u2019s quite difficult to hire people, wages moving up, and that  kind\u2014s o, quite a tight labor market.", "So our view, I think \u2014widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall, including kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties, including th e expiration of unemployment \u2014extra unemployment benefits, and other things would come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we \u2019d get out of this strange world where there \u2019re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor shortage.", "And I think, so that affects\u2014for example, when schools are open 60 percent of the time or when they\u2019 re always at a threat of being closed because o f Delta, the Delta variant, you know, you might want to wait .", "Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have to quit it three weeks later, you\u2019 re going to wait until you \u2019re confident of that.", "So we \u2014so that \u2014really , the big shortfall in labor, in jobs , was largely in travel a nd leisure , and that\u2019s because of \u2014clearly because of Delta.", "It just may take a longer time.", "In terms of the \u2014you asked also about the test for November.", "I think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think\u2014and also the overall situation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting .", "So, you know, for me, it wouldn\u2019 t take a knockout, great, super strong employment report.", "It would take a reasonably good employment report for me to feel like that test is met.", "And others on the Committee \u2014many on the Committee feel that the test is already met.", "So I don\u2019 t personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I \u2019d like to see a good\u2014a decent employment report.", "I mean, it \u2019s not, it \u2019s, again, it \u2019s not to be confused with the test for liftoff, which is so much higher.", "I respect that that\u2019 s the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward, and I would accept that.", "September 22, 2021 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 15 of 27   And, furthermore, you know, it \u2019s fully appropriate to look at \u2014for a new person to come in and look at the current s tate of regulation and supervision and suggest appropriate changes, and I welcome that.", "In terms of Vice Chair Quarles \u2019s term, we \u2019re not currently in that situation, and I actually don\u2019 t have any updates for you on that today.", "Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a particular unemployment rate for any particular group.", "Really , we look at a broad range of \u2014a very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is.", "And one of the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing.", "So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market.", "If you look at the last two or three years of , before the pandemic hit, you saw \u2014after a lot of long progress, you saw a really strong labor market.", "And you saw wages at the low end moving up faster than everywhere else\u2014s omething that \u2019s great to see.", "We also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various, you know, for African  Americans, for example, and also participation rates.", "There September 22, 2021 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 16 of 27   were no imbalances in the economy, and then along came the pandemic.", "We were not \u2014there was nothing in the economy that looked like a buildup of imbalances that could cause a recession.", "We also said we wouldn \u2019t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment , in the absence of inflation.", "So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that tha t really benefited  labor market participants in a broad and inclusive way.", "That \u2019s, of course, not the current situation.", "We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not moderately above target.", "It isn \u2019t really just targeting the headline numbers, but it \u2019s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment.", "I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies \u2014frankly, education policies and t hat kind of thing\u2014 are better at focusing on.", "So it\u2019s just very important that the debt ceiling be rais ed in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills when and as they come due.", "The failure to do that is something that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and to the financia l markets.", "And that, you know, no one should assume that the F ed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure \u2014fully protect in the event of a failure  to, you know, to make sure that we do pay those debts when they\u2019 re due.", "We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an unprecedented asset cap that will stay in plac e until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems.", "And we \u2019re not going to remove that asset cap until that \u2019s done.", "But I can \u2019t speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any individual  bank.", "You know, in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing, I think no one is happy, no one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised.", "This is an important moment for the F ed, and I \u2019m determined that we will rise to the moment and handle it in ways that will stand up over time.", "So, you know, the five -year review that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution, their performance on the F OMC, all of those  things.", "September 22, 2021 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 20 of 27   You\u2019re right, though, these \u2014as I mentioned, we have had a framework for a long time, and it \u2019s similar to what other government agencies have, only it \u2019s a little stricter.", "And it is that you can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt.", "You can\u2019 t trade during the FOMC period and du ring the meeting \u2014the blackout period and then during the meeting.", "You\u2019re looking for conditions consistent with maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time.", "So you\u2019 re not necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time.", "But more to your point , really, we actually September 22, 2021 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 21 of 27   have a paragraph in our framework, and something like thi s has been there for a long time.", "And you\u2019 re talking about a situation in which the two goals are not complementary ; they\u2019 re somehow in tension.", "And if we judge that \u2019s effect \u2014that is the case, what it says is , we take i nto account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate.", "So, we used to call that the balanced -approach paragraph because it had those words.", "So it\u2019s a very difficult situation for any central bank to be \u2014pardon me \u2014to be in a situation where the two goals are in tension.", "How long will it take , and how big are the gaps , and that kind of thing.", "We don\u2019 t really think we \u2019re in that \u2014we \u2019re sort of in that situation, I\u2019 d say, in a short -term way.", "But we think, we do expect that this is sort of \u2014because of the COVID shock and the reopening and all that , you\u2019 re seeing this temporarily.", "Corporate defaults are very low in the United States right now.", "Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that ended with the pandemic.", "We were concerned in September 22, 2021 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 22 of 27   the last year or so, and then I \u2019d say very concerned at the beginning of the pandemic that, if you\u2019ve got a highly lever aged company and your revenue stops for an uncertain period, as things happened at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of defaults.", "And I think for whatever reason now , you have very, very low default rates now among corporate debt.", "You know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has had.", "In  terms of the implications for us, there isn \u2019t, there \u2019s not a lot of direct United States exposure.",

wouldn\u2019 t draw a parallel to the United States corporate sector.", "I\u2019m focused on doing my job \u2014 September 22, 2021 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 23 of 27

surveys generally.", "For the most part, surveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near  term but not in the lo nger term.", "So there are many, many different inflation measures, of course.", "And that \u2019s why we have this thing called the CIE, which is the, it\u2019 s an index of \u2014it\u2019s market -based measures, i t\u2019s professional forecasters , and it \u2019s household surveys.", "And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up.", "Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in, say , 2013, which was before the really\u2014 the drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in \u2019 14 and \u2019 15\u2014around then.", "But, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important.", "And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently above levels that are really consistent with o ur mandate, then, you know, we would certainly react to that.", "We see more of a moderate increase that is\u2014the September 22, 2021 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 25 of 27   first part of which is welcome.", "And because, you know, inflation expectations had drifted down, and it was good to see them get back up a bit.", "I think this will b e a shorter period.", "The economy\u2019 s much farther along than it was when we tapered in 2013.", "It \u2019s a very gradual taper.", "You  wouldn\u2019 t, no, because, you know, when you\u2019 re\u2014as long as you\u2019re buying assets, you \u2019re adding accommodation,
