last year, and then we expect \u2014though, particularly with the effects of the war , but also the data we \u2019ve seen so far this year \u2014we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down, and then come down more sharply next year .", "So that \u2019s one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that we\u2014the Committee really does understand

return the economy to price stability and [is] determined to use our tools to do exactly that .", "You couched it in terms of real rates.", "I would say, if you look at the SEP, you\u2019 ve got people getting close to or even above , in many cases, their estimate of the longer- run neutral rate .", "So I understand that doesn\u2019 t do it for real rates .", "But if you go out a year or two,

to deploy our tools to achieve our goals \u2014and that includes the price -stability goal.", "So part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is clearly to do with factors other than our policy, and those would include , potentially , the supply chain is getting a little bit better, certain ly base effects.", "You \u2019re lapping\u2014 as you know, when you look at a 12 -month trailing window, you\u2019 re lapping very high inflation in March, April, May, June of last year .", "Really what we \u2019re looking for, though, is month- by-month inflation coming down.", "And so it \u2019s really , it\u2019s all the things we\u2019 ve been talking about, you know, that really haven\u2019 t helped much , including the shift away from goods and back to services , including supply chains getting better , including labor force participation \u2014all those things that have been sticky and not happening.", "You know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation, and on growth, with a lag, of course .", "But also , remember we started talking about rate increases last year.", "For some months now , financial conditions have already incorporated a significant

have to put together the consensus on the Committee and present that consensus.", "So I wouldn\u2019 t talk about my individual one .", "And in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is \u2014there \u2019s seven remaining meetings this year .", "But there \u2019s seven remaining meetings, and there \u2019s seven rate hikes.", "I would add there \u2019s also the shrinkage of the balance sheet , which , you people do the math different ways, but that might be the equivalent of another rate increase just from the runoff of the balance sheet .", "We\u2019ll be looking to see whether the data show expected improvement on inflation .", "We\u2019 ll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgement .", "And we \u2019ll be going\u2014each meeting is a li ve meeting .", "And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we\u2019 ll do so.", "And , as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet .", "We wi ll take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor market.", "And we \u2019re certainly , we noticed it in the last meeting .", "We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was, and that \u2019s part of what \u2019s happening is, in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they were before the crisis.", "In other cases, it \u2019s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services.", "So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligati on to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so .", "But if you look, people do have their in \u2014by  the end of this year, broadly, people are at or close to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer -run neutral interest rate .", "So that should stop pushing \u2014that should, in other words, that should be a removal of accommodation for monetary policy, basically .", "At the same time, we will have done  significant balance sheet runoff .", "In the next year , and just looking at the median, you\u2019 re now above the , you know, above the, what people estimate to be the longer -run median.", "A nd also, in many people \u2019s forecasts, that actually amounts to, you know, tight policy under , in real rates as well .", "So why does unemployment remain at 3.5 percent ?", "One is the connection between\u2014in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight.", "March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 14 of 26   But this is \u2014clearly , what this is is an expectation that, really it amounts to that , the idea that wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the long run with 2 percent  inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive, full-economy kind of \u2014full -employment kind of wages , but not to a point where they \u2019re pushing up inflation anymore .", "And , as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down.", "But no matter what happens, this is a C ommittee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched .", "And so we are determined on that front, and we \u2019ll deal with what comes .", "Well, if you take a look at today\u2019 s labor market, what you have is 1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person.", "So that \u2019s a very, very tight labor market \u2014tight to an unhealthy level, I would say.", "So, in principle, if  you were \u2014let \u2019s say that our tools work about as you described, and the idea is, we \u2019re trying to better align demand and supply, let\u2019s just say in the labor market.", "S o it would actually, if you were just moving down the number of job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 15 of 26   wages.", "You would have a lot less of a labor shortage, which is going on pretty much across the economy.", "So that \u2019s really the thinking there , is, you know, these are fairly well -understood channels, interest sensitive.", "And , basically , across the economy, we\u2019 d like to slow demand so that it\u2019 s better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand.", "And that , over time , should bring inflation down.", "And I \u2019ll say again, though, you know, we don\u2019 t have a perfect crystal ball about the future, a nd we \u2019re prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability .", "You know, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there \u2014you really can \u2019t have a sustained period of maximum employment .", "It\u2019s our\u2014one  of our most fundamental obligations is to maintain and restore, in this case, price stability .", "Of course, the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market.", "But we have to restore price stability .", "You know, what we saw in the last cycle was that, over the course of a long, steady expansion, l abor force participation outperformed expectations .", "And that was just a , you know, it was a tight labor market, but it wasn\u2019 t\u2014it was nowhere near as tight as this labor market .", "But it was a tight labor market, and so people stayed in the labor force longer .", "It wasn \u2019t so much people coming back in the labor force after retirement.", "And, you know, more labor force participation is tremendously welcome .", "And, of course, our policy does not in any way preclude that .", "This is a situation where wages have moved up at the highest rate in a very long time .", "And people are able to quit their jobs and move to better -paying jobs in the same industry or different indus tries.", "So it \u2019s a really attractive labor market for people .", "So we hope that that will lead to more labor supply .", "And it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation more at risk .", "But, in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well.", "It\u2019s not the only thing we \u2019re looking for, though, from inflation.", "We\u2019re looking for help from a number of different places and, most importantly, from our own policy.", "So, as you know, policy works through financial conditions .", "That \u2019s how it reaches the real economy \u2014by just the mechanisms you mentioned.", "And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive , and appropriately so, fiscal policy , but also highly accommodative monetary policy\u2014 the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic .", "So it is very appropriate to move away from thos e. And, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things \u2014we \u2019re not targeting any one or more of those things, but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal le vel so that \u2014because we know the economy no longer needs , or wants , these very highly accommodative, this  stance, which , you know, so it \u2019s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more  normal levels.", "So I would say, we look at a broad range of financial conditions .", "And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy.", "It\u2019 s not any particular financial condition, but a  broad range of financial conditions .", "But, yes , we need our policy to transmit to the real economy.", "And it does so through financial conditions, which means that, as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 of 26   it\u2019s at least less accommodative, that broader financial conditions will also be less accommodative .", "So, at our meeting today and yesterday, we made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance sheet .", "And I \u2019d say we \u2019re now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we\u2019ll actually begin a  runoff at a coming meeting.", "And that could come as soon as our next meeting in May.", "We\u2019 ll be mindful of the bro ader financial and economic context when we make the decision on timing, a nd we always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability .", "We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what \u2019s a highly uncertain situation already.", "In terms of the \u2014I would say this .", "And I would also say that there \u2019ll be\u2014I\u2019m sure there\u2019 ll be a more detailed discussion of our \u2014in the minutes March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 26   to our meeting that come out in three weeks , where I expect that it will lay out, you know, pretty much the parameters of what we \u2019re looking at, which I think will look quite familiar.", "A nd that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates .", "What we said was, if we see, you know, low unemployment, high employment , but we don\u2019 t see inflation, then we \u2019re not going to raise rates \u2019 til we actually see inflation .", "There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates.", "The framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2  percent .", "It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation.", "You know, I think our vision on this on the Committee is very, very clear .", "What we see is a strong labor market .", "We see a  labor market with a lot of momentum, great job creation .", "And we see the underlying economy\u2019s  strong.", "Balance sheets are strong .", "Yes, there are threats to growth March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 20 of 26   from, you know, from what \u2019s going on in Eastern Europe .", "And, but, nonetheless, in the base case, there \u2019s a pretty broad expectation of strong growth.", "But inflation is far above our target.", "And, you know, the help we \u2019ve been expecting and other forecasters have been expecting from supply -side improvement, labor force participation, bottlenecks, all those things getting better \u2014it hasn \u2019t come .", "And so we \u2019re looking now to using our tools to restore price s tability, and we \u2019re committed to doing that .", "And you see that in the decision we make, and you\u2019 ll continue to see it in the decisions we make , going forward.", "The goal, of course, is t o restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market.", "We have a dual mandate, and they \u2019re sort of equal .", "But , as I said earlier, you know, price stability is an essential goal .", "In fact, it \u2019s a precondition, really, for achieving the kind of labor market that we want, which is a strong and sustained labor market .", "We saw the benefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market .", "It pulled people back in, and there were really no imbalances in the economy that threatened the  long expansi on.", "We, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market .", "But we do understand also that, really, you can\u2019 t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability .", "So we need to focus on price stability particularly, because the labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong.", "We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy .", "So I guess I \u2019d start by just assuring everyone that we \u2019re fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion.", "We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the  source, have real effects on people \u2019s well -being.", "And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone .", "But it \u2019s really , especially , on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where \u2014I mean, we \u2019ve all  seen charts that show, if you\u2019 re a middle -income person, you\u2019 ve got room to absorb some inflation.", "If you\u2019 re at the lower end of the income spectrum, it\u2019 s very hard because you\u2019re spending most of your money already on necessities , and the price is going up .", "So it has been a difficult time for the economy .", "But we do anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier .", "It may take longer than we like, but I \u2019m confident that we \u2019ll use our tools to bring inflation down.", "You asked about rates.", "So the way that works , I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest -sensitive parts of the economy .", "And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it \u2019s better match ed with supply.", "And that brings \u2014that will bring inflation down over time .", "I mean, as I just said, you know, I think we do understand very much, and we very much take to heart , that it\u2019 s our obligation to restore price stability .", "And, you know, we \u2019ve had price stability for a very long time and maybe come to take it for granted .", "I\u2019m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like .", "And, you know, we \u2019re strongly committed as a C ommittee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more nor mal levels, which \u2014our target is 2 percent inflation .", "And I just would want people to understand that, and that \u2019s\u2014but the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet .", "And so financial conditions will become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity.", "That will slow the economy, while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong .", "And, you know, the good news is, the economy and the labor market are quite strong .", "And that means the economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases.", "Well, I , you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent , while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very strong.", "If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that \u2019s strong within the context of U .S.", "potential economic output .", "And to the March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 23 of 26   extent the data come in different, then, of course, our policy will adapt .", "But we do believe that our policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down inflation .", "We believe that we can do so while sustaining a strong labor market .", "The labor market is \u2014it\u2019s not strong in the ordinary sense of the word.", "We have not seen a labor market where there are 1.7 job openings for every une mployed person or where there , if you add job openings to those who are employed, that \u2019s actually substantially a larger number than the size of the workforce , than the number of people who actually count themselves as in the workforce .", "So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply.", "And when that happens, prices go up.", "And they\u2014so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back.", "Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally very in favor of these sanctions .", "But let me say this:  S anctions are really the business of the elected government, and that \u2019s true everywhere .", "So the A dministration and the Treasury March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 24 of 26   Department, in particular, and other agencies \u2014they create these sanctions.", "And so I \u2019m reluctant to comment on sanctions really much because, again, they \u2019re not for us  [to decide].", "We have a very specific mandate.", "So the way I would say i t is this:  We, first of all, I would agree with the premise that wages moving up is a great thing.", "And , generally , it\u2019s driven over long periods by rising productivity.", "But what we have now, if you look at these , the wage increases that we have, we look at a\u2014we \u2019re blessed with a range of measures of wages that all measure different things.", "But right now, they\u2019 re all showing the same thing, which is that the increases \u2014not the levels , but the i ncreases\u2014are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent  inflation, our goal , over time .", "And that \u2019s really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage \u2013price spiral;  is that something that \u2019s going to start happening and become entrenched in the system ?", "You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very
