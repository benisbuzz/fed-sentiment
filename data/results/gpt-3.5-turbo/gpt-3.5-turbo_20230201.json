economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment.", "The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that

down.", "And I think will\u2014a  story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough.", "But I think there is \u2014there\u2019s ongoing disinflation , and we don\u2019 t yet see

that growth will continue \u2014positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year.", "We had growth of \u2014GDP growth of 1 per cent last year and also final sales growth, which

activity.", "So I think there \u2019s a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year.", "And that \u2019s my base case , is that there will be positive growth this year.", "So, of course, we \u2019ll be looking \u2014by the time of the March meeting, we\u2019ll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports, and we \u2019ll be looking at those carefully

that we like because it  adjusts  for composition and it \u2019s very complete.", "It\u2019s\u2014you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level.", "So I don\u2019 t want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it \u2019s going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy over time.", "But

\u2014I mean, there are many different forecasts, but , generally, it \u2019s a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly.", "And , in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year.", "Of course, other people have forecasts with i nflation coming down much faster, that \u2019s a different thing.", "You know, if that happens \u2014inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we \u2019ll be seeing that , and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.", "I\u2019m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is largely due to the market \u2019s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly.", "So, again, as I just mentioned, we \u2014you know, our forecasts \u2014different participants have  differe nt forecasts, but , generally, those forecasts are
