["It\u2019s been about three and a half years since the economic recovery began.", "The economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.", "Unfortunately, however, unemployment remains high.", "About 5 million people \u2014more than 40 percent of the unemployed\u2014have been with out a job for six months or more, and millions more who say they would like full -time work have been able to find only part -time employment or have stopped looking entirely.", "The conditions now prevailing in the job market represent an enormous waste of human and economic potential.", "A return to broad- based prosperity will require sustained improvement in the job market, which in turn requires stronger economic growth.", "Meanwhile, apart from some temporary fluctuations that largely reflected swings in energ y prices, inflation has remained tame and appears  likely to run at or below the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC \u2019s) 2 percent objective in coming quarters and over the longer term.", "Against a macroeconomic backdrop that includes both high unemployment and subdued inflation, the FOMC will maintain its highly accommodative policy.", "Today the Committee took several steps.", "First, it decided to continue its purchases of agency mortgage -backed securities (MBS), initiated at the September meeting, at a pace o f $40 billion per month.", "Second, the Committee decided to purchase longer -term Treasury securities, initially at a pace of $45 billion per month, after its current program to extend the average maturity of its holdings is completed at the end of the year.", "In continuing its asset purchases, the Committee seeks to maintain downward pressure on longer -term interest rates and to keep financial conditions accommodative, thereby promoting hiring and economic growth while ensuring that inflation December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    2 of 34  over time is clo se to our 2 percent objective.", "Finally, the Committee today also modified its guidance about future rate policy to provide more information to the public about how it anticipates it will react to evolving economic conditions.", "I will return to this change  in our communication after discussing our decision to continue asset purchases.", "Although the Committee\u2019s announcement today specified the initial monthly pace and composition of asset purchases, it did not give specific dates at which the program may be modified or ended.", "Instead, the pattern of future asset purchases will depend on the Committee\u2019s evaluation of incoming information, in two respects.", "First, we expect to continue asset purchases until we see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the  labor market, in a context of price stability.", "In assessing the extent of progress, the Committee will be evaluating a range of labor market indicators, including the unemployment rate, payroll employment, hours worked, and labor force participation, among others.", "Because increases in demand and production are normally precursors to improvements in labor market conditions, we will also be looking carefully at the pace of economic activity more broadly.", "Second, the Committee will be monitoring economic and financial developments to assess both the efficacy and possible drawbacks of its asset purchase program.", "The Federal Reserve\u2019s asset purchases over the past few years have provided important support to the economy, for example, by helping to keep mort gage rates historically low.", "The Committee expects this policy tool to continue to be effective and the costs and risks to remain manageable, but as the program continues, we will be regularly updating those assessments.", "If future evidence suggests that the program\u2019s effectiveness has declined, or if potential unintended side effects or risks become apparent as the balance sheet grows, we will modify the program as December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    3 of 34  appropriate.", "More generally, the Committee intends to be flexible in varying the pace of securities purchases in response to information bearing on the outlook or on the perceived benefits and costs of the program.", "Unlike the explicitly quantitative criteria associated with the Committee\u2019s forward guidance about the federal funds rate, which I  will discuss in a moment, the criteria the Committee will use to make decisions about the pace and extent of its asset purchase program are qualitative; in particular, continuation of asset purchases is tied to our seeing substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.", "Because we expect to learn more over time about the efficacy and potential costs of asset purchases  in the current economic context , we believe that qualitative guidance is more appropriate at this time.", "In today\u2019s statement, the Committee also recast its forward guidance to clarify how it expects its target for the federal funds rate to depend on future economic developments.", "Specifically, the Committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted \u201cat least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6\u00bd percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than half a percentage point above the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer -run goal, a nd longer -term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\u201d   This formulation is a change from earlier statements in which forward guidance about the federal funds rate was expressed in terms of a date; for example, in the statements following its  September and October meetings,  the Committee indicated that it anticipated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted \u201c at least through mid -2015.\u201d  The  modified  formulation  makes more explicit  the FOMC\u2019s intention  to maintain accommodation as  long as  needed to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability, a strategy that we believe will help support December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    4 of 34  household and business confidence and spending.", "By tying future monetary policy more expli citly to economic conditions, this formulation of our policy guidance should also make monetary policy more transparent and predictable to the public.", "The change in the form of the Committee\u2019s forward guidance does not in itself imply any change in the Com mittee\u2019s expectations about the likely future path of the federal funds rate since the October meeting.", "In particular, the Committee expects that the stated threshold for unemployment will not be reached before mid- 2015 and projects that inflation will re main close to 2 percent over that period.", "Thus, given the Committee\u2019s current outlook, the guidance introduced today is consistent with the Committee\u2019s earlier statements that \u201cexceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted  at least through mid -2015.\u201d    Let me emphasize that the 6 \u00bd percent threshold for the unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the Committee\u2019s longer -term objective for unemployment.", "Indeed, in the economic projections submitted in conjunction with today\u2019s meeting, the central tendency of participants\u2019 est imates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment is 5.2 to 6.0 percent.", "However, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with a lag, the Committee believes that it likely will need to begin moving away from a highly accommodative policy stance before the economy reaches maximum employment.", "Waiting until maximum employment is achieved before beginning the process of removing policy accommodation could lead to an undesirable overshooting of potential output and compromise the FOMC\u2019s longer -term inflation objective of 2 percent.", "As the FOMC statement makes clear, the Committee anticipates that policy under the new guidance will be fully consistent with continued progress against unemployment and with inflation remaining close to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective over the longer term.", "December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    5 of 34  Although the modified guidance should provide greater clarity about how the Committee expects to respond to incoming data, it by no means puts monetary policy on autopilot.", "First, as the statement notes, the Committee views its current low -rate policy as likely to be appropriate at least  until the specified thresholds are met.", "Reaching one of those thresholds, however, will not automatically trigger immediate reduction in policy accommodation.", "For example, if unemployment were to decline to slightly below 6\u00bd percent at a time when inflation and inflation expectations were subdued and were projected to remain so, the Committee might judge an immediate increase in its  target for the federal funds rate to be inappropriate.", "Ultimately , in deciding when and how quickly to reduce policy accommodation, the Committee will follow a balanced approach in seeking to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer -run 2 percent  goal and deviations of employment from its estimated maximum level.", "Second, the Committee recognizes that no single indicator provides a complete assessment of the state of the labor market and therefore will consider changes in the unemployment rate within the broader context of labor market conditions.", "For example, in evaluating a given decline in the unemployment rate, the Committee will also take into account the extent to which that decline was associated with increases in employment and hours worked, as opposed to, say, increases in the number of discouraged workers and falling labor force participation.", "The Committee will also consider whether the improvement in the unemployment rate appears sustainable.", "Third, the Committee chose to express the inflation threshold in terms of projected inflation between one and two years ahead, rather than in terms of current inflation.", "The Committee took this approach to make clear that it intends to look through purely transitory December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    6 of 34  fluctuations in inflation, suc h as those induced by short -term variations in the prices of internationally traded commodities, and to focus instead on the underlying inflation trend.", "In making its collective judgment about the underlying inflation trend, the Committee will consider a variety of indicators, including measures such as median, trimmed mean, and core inflation; the views of outside forecasters; and the predictions of econometric and statistical models of inflation.", "Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored.", "Finally, the Committee will continue to monitor a wide range of information on economic and financial developments to ensure that policy is conducted in a manner consistent w ith our dual mandate.", "It\u2019s worth noting that the goals of the FOMC\u2019s asset purchases and of its federal funds rate guidance are somewhat different.", "The goal of the asset purchase program is to increase the near-term momentum of the economy by fostering more -accommodative financial conditions, while the purpose of the rate guidance is to provide information about the future circumstances under which the Committee would contemplate reducing accommodation.", "I would emphasize that a decision by the Committee  to end asset purchases, whenever that point is reached, would not be a turn to tighter policy.", "While in that circumstance the Committee would no longer be increasing policy accommodation, its policy stance would remain highly supportive of growth.", "Only at some later point would the Committee begin actually removing accommodation through rate increases.", "Moreover, as I have discussed today, the decisions to modify the asset purchase program and to undertake rate increases are tied to different criteria.", "In conclusion, the FOMC\u2019s actions today are part of our ongoing efforts to support economic recovery and job creation while maintaining price stability.", "As I have often stressed, December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    7 of 34  however, monetary policy has its limits; only the private and public sectors working together can get the U.S. economy fully back on track.", "In particular, it will be critical that fiscal policymakers come together soon to achieve longer -term fiscal sustainability without adopting policies that could derail the ongoing recovery.", "Well, so first, the \u2014as I said \u2014the asset purchases and the rate increases have different objectives.", "The asset purchases are about creating some near -term momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate t arget, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing accommodation.", "Secondly, the asset purchases are a less well-understood tool.", "We have \u2014we\u2019ll be learning over time about how efficacious they are, about what costs they may carry with them in terms of unintended consequences that they might December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    8 of 34  create, and we\u2019ll be seeing how \u2014what else happens in the economy that can affect, you know, the level of unemployment, for example, that we hope to achieve.", "And so, for that reason, a s I discussed in my opening remarks, we decided to make the criteria for asset purchases qualitative at this time because we have a number of different things that we need to look at as we go forward.", "Rate increases, by contrast, are well understood, and we understand the relationship between those rate increases and the state of the economy.", "And so we\u2019ve been able to give somewhat more quantitative, more specific guidance in that respect.", "Going forward, we\u2019ll drop the date and rely on the conditionality, and that has, I think, a very important advantage which is that if news comes in that the economy is stronger or weaker, then financial markets and the public will be able to adjust their expectations for when policy tightening will occur without the Committee having to go through a process of changing its date in a nontr ansparent way, so I think that\u2019s beneficial.", "We had a very substantial discussion of the threshold approach at our last meeting.", "We \u2014while there are different views on aspects of the threshold approach, there was a lot  of agreement that having a more explicit connection between rate policy and the state of the economy was more transparent and December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    9 of 34  more helpful to the markets and to the public than our date -based guidance, and therefore, there was a general view that, at some point at least, that we should switch to that kind of guidance.", "So we do hope that it\u2019ll be more helpful and give markets more information about how we\u2019re going to respond going forward.", "It is not a change in our relative balance, weights, towards inflation and unemployment \u2014by no means.", "First of all, with respect to inflation, we remain completely committed to our 2 percent longer -run objective.", "Moreover, we expect our forecast, as you can see from the Summary of Economic Projections; our forecasts are  that inflation will actually remain, despite this threshold of 2\u00bd, that inflation will actually remain at or below 2 percent going forward.", "And so\u2014and finally, the thresholds that we have put out are entirely consistent with our long -standing views on what the rate path has to be, what the path of interest rates has to be, in order to achieve improvement in the labor market while keeping inflation close to target.", "So we \u2014I think both sides of the mandate are well -served here.", "There is no real change in  policy.", "What it is instead is an attempt to clarify the relationship between policy and economic conditions.", "Well, clearly the fiscal cliff is having effects on the economy.", "Even though we\u2019ve not yet even reached the point of the fiscal cliff potentially kicking in, it\u2019s already affecting business investment and hiring decisions by creating uncertainty or creating pessimism.", "We saw wha t happened recently to consumer sentiment, which fell, December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    10 of 34  presumably in part because of concerns about the fiscal cliff.", "So, clearly, this is a major risk factor and a major source of uncertainty about the economy going forward.", "I would suspect and, althoug h the participants don\u2019t all make this explicit, but I would suspect that what they are assuming in their projections is that the fiscal cliff gets resolved in some intermediate way, whereby there is  still some fiscal drag but not as much as implied by the  entire fiscal cliff.", "But as you \u2014you\u2019re absolutely right that there is a lot of uncertainty right now and if the fiscal cliff situation turns out to be resolved in a way very different from our expectations, I\u2019m sure you would see changes in the forecast.", "You recall in September we expressed dis satisfaction with progress in the labor market.", "We, at that point, we began the $40 billion per month of MBS purchases and we said that unless we saw substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market that we would December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    11 of 34  undertake additional asset purchases or other actions.", "The reason is that, at least in my view and I think many of my colleagues\u2019, that what matters primarily is the mix of assets on the balance sheet, on the asset side of the balance sheet.", "So what\u2019s imp ortant is the fact that we\u2019re acquiring Treasury securities and MBS, taking those out of the market, you know, forcing investors into other closely related assets and that\u2019s where the stimulus comes from, not so much in the size of the balance sheet per se .", "In terms of criteria, again, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve announced an initial amount of 85 billion a mont h of purchases.", "For example, if the economy\u2019s outlook gets noticeably stronger, we would presumably begin to ramp down the level of purchases.", "We\u2019ll be looking at the outlook for labor market, which is very important, but we\u2019ll also be looking at other factors that may be affecting the outlook for the economy.", "For example, I hope it won\u2019t happen but if the fiscal cliff occurs, as I\u2019ve said many times, I don\u2019t think the Federal Reserve has the tools to offset that event and, in that case, we obviously have to temper our expectations about what we can accomplish.", "But obviously, as long as the costs and other concerns do not em erge, we\u2019ll be looking for, you know, something that is substantial in terms of a better job market.", "Well, for the first part of your question if the economy actually went off the fiscal cliff, our assessment, the CBO\u2019s assessment, outside forecasters, all think that that would have very significant adverse effects on the economy and on the unemployment rate.", "But I just want to, again, be clear that we cannot offset the full impact of the fiscal cliff.", "It\u2019s just too big given the tools that we have available and the limitations on our policy toolkit at this point.", "O n terms of the terminology, well, and people have different preferences about what they want to call things, I think it\u2019s a sensible term because I think of the fiscal policies providing support to the economy.", "If fiscal policy becomes very contractionary , the economy will, I think, go off a cliff.", "I don\u2019t buy the idea that a short -term descent off the fiscal cliff would be not costly.", "Why is it that consumer confidence December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    13 of 34  dropped so sharply this week?", "Why is it that small business confidence dropped so sharply?", "Why is \u2014why are the markets volatile?", "Why is business investment at among its weakest levels during the recovery?", "I thi nk all of these things, at least to some extent, can be traced to the anticipation and the concern about the fiscal cliff and I think that, you know, we don\u2019t know exactly what would happen but I think there is certainly a risk that it could be serious and, therefore, I think it is very important.", "The most helpful thing that could\u2014that, I think, Congress, the Administration could do right now is find a resolution that, on the one hand, achieves long-run fiscal sustainability , which is critical, absolutely critical for a healthy economy, but also avoids derailing the recovery which is currently in process.", "So first of all, we don\u2019t have a precise estimate of the long -run sustai nable unemployment rate.", "The estimates that were provided in the Summary of Economic Projections today, as has been the case for a while, is 5.2 to 6.0 percent.", "So, it could be well less than 6 \u00bd percent, so that gives us some time.", "December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    14 of 34  My anticipation is that the removal of accommodation after the takeoff point, whe never that occurs, would be relatively gradual.", "Of course, that depends on where inflation is and other conditions.", "But it\u2019s \u2014the path that we\u2019r e basing these numbers on is one that assumes, first of all, as you anticipated, assumes a n increase in the funds rate first occurring some time after unemployment goes below 6\u00bd percent, but does not necessarily assume a rapid increase after that.", "And I \u2014what we said in our statement is that we would take a balanced approach.", "In other words, you know, once we get to that point, we may or may not raise rates at that point.", "But assuming that inflation remains well controlled, w hich I fully anticipate, I think that the rate of increase in rates would be moderate.", "This is consistent \u2014the exit strategy that we put out is consistent with our statement today because the exit strategy was primarily about how we would normalize the balance sheet over time.", "And at this time we have not made any changes in that, and we believe that some increase in the size of our balance sheet is consistent still with that general sequence that we laid out in the minutes a year and a half ago.", "That be ing said, if the balance sheet grows by enough, we may have to reconsider the pace or timing of that, but I don\u2019t see any changes that would, you know, radically change the time to normalization or the time to exit.", "I\u2019m hoping that the Congress will do the right thing on the fiscal cliff.", "It might avoid some of the short -term impact on the recovery, but it could create concerns about our longer -term fiscal situation and I don\u2019t want to see that.", "So I think for the best \u2014it\u2019s in the best interest of the economy to come t o a two -part solution, if you will.", "Part one is to modify fiscal policy in a way that doesn\u2019t create enormous headwinds for the recovery in the near term.", "And part two is to at least take important steps towards achieving a framework, at least, by which,  perhaps through further negotiation, the Congress  and the Administration can achieve a sustainable path for fiscal policy.", "If we got important new information about the structure of the economy, it\u2019s possible, but I consider it relatively unlikely and this is one of the best \u2014this is one of the advantages of this approach over the date -based approach.", "If information comes in which says the economy is stronger or weaker than we expected, that would, in principle, require a change in the date.", "But it doesn\u2019t necessarily require a change in the thresholds because that date adjustment can be made by markets just simply by looking at their own forecasts of when unemployment will cross the line and the behavior of inflation.", "Well, I come from a part of South Carol ina which has been economically challenged for quite a long time and remains so.", "I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from \u2014mostly agricultural, it has a little bit of manufacturing \u2014has a very high  unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate, December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    17 of 34  and people are having a hard time there.", "So, part of the reason that, you know, we are engaging these policies is to try and create a stronger economy \u2014more jobs \u2014so that folks across the country, including places like the one where I grew up, you know, will have more opportunity to have better lives for themselves.", "It\u2019s easy to look at the unemployment rate and say, well it\u2019s one -tenth or two -tenths.", "So it is very important to try to keep in mind the reality of unemployment, of  foreclosure, of weak wage growth, et cetera, so we always try to do that.", "And I want to\u2014it\u2019s always a delicate balance\u2014 you don\u2019t want to scare people.", "But as many analysts, not just the Fed, have pointed out, if the fiscal cliff was allowed to occur, and certainly if it were sustained for any period, it could have a very negative effect on hiring, jobs, wages, economic activity, investment .", "And of course, the consequences of that will be felt by everybody but certainly by those in areas like where I grew up that are relatively weak economically, would no doubt would feel the greater brunt.", "But it is the \u2014it is a f act that this greater clarity will help markets better predict how bond yields will behave.", "As we go forward in time, if the economy continues to strengthen as we hope, as the exit comes closer for the Federal Reserve, then you would expect longer -term bond yields to begin to rise.", "And the more information we can provide to markets about the conditionality under which the Fed would consider removing accommodation, the better information they\u2019ll have about the likely path of  bonds and that will allow for a smoother adjustment.", "The major reason is to give the markets and the public more transparency about what\u2019s determining our policy, but that is one potential advanta ge.", "So, the kind of optimal policy path that Vice Chairman Yellen showed is indicative of the kinds of analysis we \u2019ve done.", "I mean, we \u2019ve run it for a variety of different scenarios, different assumptions about models , and so on, but the general December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    19 of 34  character of that interest rate path, i.e.", ", that it stays low until unemployment is in the vicinity of 6\u00bd or a little lower, and then rises relativ ely slowly, which goes back to the question that was asked earlier, that it doesn \u2019t involve a rapid removal of accommodation after that point is reached.", "You \u2019ll note also in that kind of policy path, of the type that she discussed , that inflation stays essentially at 2 or very close to 2.", "In terms of inflation forecast, the \u2014what the C ommittee will do on a regular basis is include in its statement its views of where inflation is likely to be a year from now.", "For example, currently, we already say that, you know, we expect inflation to run at or below the Committee\u2019s objective in a long er term.", "The intellectual exercise we\u2019ll be doing is asking ourselves if we maintain low rates along the lines suggested by this policy, would we ex pect inflation to cross the threshold or reach that level?", "Now, it\u2019s very important that the public, the m edia, the markets find our projections credible, obviously.", "And so for that reason, you know, we will be referring extensively to publicly available information such as various measures of inflation\u2014 I mentioned some in my opening remarks \u2014outside forecasts , the breakevens from inflation protected bonds, et cetera.", "So, if our outlook deviates in any sense in a significant way from sort of what all these things are saying, at a minimum, it will be incumbent on me and the rest of us to explain that.", "But again, just to be clear, the projection that matters for our determination is the one that the Committee collectively comes up with.", "At that point, we announced our dissatisfac tion with the state of the labor market and the outlook for jobs and said we would take further action if the outlook didn\u2019t improve.", "So, I would say that, you know, looking at it f rom the perspective of September, that we have, in fact, taken significant additional action to provide support for the recovery and for job creation.", "The reason \u2014one of the considerations though, as I\u2019ve talked about, is that, you know, given that we are now in the world of unconventional policy that has both uncertain costs and uncertain efficacy or uncertain benefits, you know, that creates a more \u2014somewhat more complicated policy decision than the old style of just changing the federal funds rate.", "You know, there are concerns that I\u2019ve talked about in these briefings before that if the balance sheet gets indefinitely large that there would be potential risks in terms of financial stability, in terms of market functioning.", "And the Committee takes these r isks very seriously.", "And they impose a certain cost on policy that doesn\u2019t exist when you\u2019re dealing only with the federal funds rate.", "And so what we\u2019re trying to do here is balance the potential benefits, in terms of lower December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    21 of 34  unemployment and inflation at target, against the reality that as the balance sheet gets bigger that there\u2019s greater costs that might be associated with that, and those have to be taken to account.", "Well, first of all, again, these \u2014the projections that you\u2019re looking at are based on each individual \u2014this is not a Committee collective projection.", "What they are, of course, is 19 separate participants making their own projections based on their own views of optimal policy.", "So, for exa mple, it includes those folks who think that we shouldn\u2019t be doing any more purchases and their forecasts are included in there as well.", "So, it\u2019s not exactly an apples to apples comparison, but it is true that if we could wave a magic wand and get unemplo yment down to 5 percent tomorrow, obviously we would do that, but there are constraints in terms of the dynamics of the economy, in terms of the power of these tools, and in terms of the fact that we do need to take into account, you know, the possibility of other costs and risks that might be associated with a large expansion of our balance sheet.", "So I think that \u2019s the critical thing along with the long -term objective of achieving a sustainable fiscal path.", "For example, if they believe that they can achieve a strong, credible future path for fiscal policy, that would give them potentially some space to do something a little bit more expansionary in the short term.", "But, those are judgments I think that Congress has to make about whether they can simultaneously continue  support ive fiscal  policy in the short term while maintaining the credibility that, in fact, they will be addressing our structural deficit problems in the longer term.", "Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we have overestimated the pace of growth, total output growth, GDP growth, from the beginning of the recovery and we have  had therefore \u2014had to continue to scale down our estimates of output growth.", "But interestingly, at the same time, we have been more accurate, not perfectly accurate by any means, but we\u2019ve been somewhat more accurate in forecasting unemployment.", "I talked about this in remarks I gave at the New  York Economic Club recently, right before Thanksgiving.", "And I think the reconciliation is that what we\u2019re December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    23 of 34  learning is that, at least temporarily, the financial crisis may have reduced somewhat the underlying potential growth rate of the U.S. economy.", "It  has interfered with business creation, with investment, with technological advances, and so on.", "And that can account for at least part of the somewhat slower growth.", "At the same time, though, what \u2014of course, what monetary policy influences is not potent ial growth, not the underlying structural growth.", "What monetary policy affects, primarily, is the state of the business cycle, the amount of excess unemployment or the extent of recession in the economy.", "And there, I think we\u2019ve also perhaps underestimated a bit the recession, but we\u2019ve been much closer there.", "That being s aid, of course, we have over time, as we have seen disappointment in growth and job creation, we have obviously, as we did in September, have added accommodation and we\u2019ve continued\u2014 we continue to reassess the outlook.", "I think it\u2019s only fair to say that e conomic forecasting beyond a few quarters is very, very difficult.", "And what we basically are trying to do is create a plausible scenario which we think is reasonably likely \u2014base policy on that, but we prepared to adjust as new information comes in and as the outlook changes, and inevitably it will.", "So let me just reiterate it.", "As we stated , in fact , in our January set of principles , the central bank cannot control unemployment in the long run.", "There\u2019 s a little bit of a caveat here, which is that very extended periods of unemployment can interfere with the workings of the labor market.", "And so, if the Fed were not to address a large unemployment problem for a long time, it might, in fact, have some influence on the long -term unemployment rate.", "But as a general rule, as a general rule, and I think this is the right baseline, the long -term unemployment rate is determined by a range of structural features of the economy and a range of economic policies and not by monetary policy.", "So that being said, what our 6\u00bd percent threshold is is \u2014as I said in my opening remarks, it is not a target \u2014what it is is a guidepost in terms of when the beginning of the reduction of accommodation could begin.", "It is not a Taylor rule but it has the same feature that it relates policy to observables in the economy, such as unemployment and inflation.", "So, what it\u2019s basically doing is saying how our policy will e volve over time as the economy evolves.", "It has no implication that we can affect the long -run unemployment rate, which we believe is lower than 6\u00bd percent.", "We are a dual mandate central bank and I think that providing information on both sides is more helpful.", "So, I understand your point but I think that it \u2019s\u2014that providing information on unemployment and inflation gives more information to the markets , to the public that allows them to infer how our policy is likely to evolve.", "We think it\u2019s \u2014by using the thresholds which ties rates to economic conditions, we\u2019re more transparent about what\u2019s going to determine our policy in the future.", "But it had the problem that whenever economic outlook changed, the Committee was faced with the question of whether we should change the date -based guidance, and we did change it a couple of times.", "Nobody understood exactly why we made a particular change because we were not providing any kind of fundamental information about how our policy is linked to the underlying outlook.", "We\u2019re always looking to find ways to improve our communication but I do think it\u2019s more transparent and will allow the markets to respond quickly and prom ptly to changes in the outlook by adjusting when they think rate increases will begin, and therefore, it\u2019ll act, to some extent, like an automatic stabilizer.", "So if the outlook worsens and that leads markets to think that the increase in rates is further out in the future, that will tend to lower longer -term rates and that would tend to be supportive of the economy.", "As I said, we discussed it quite extensively at the last meeting.", "And December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    26 of 34  so\u2014and frankly, given that it\u2019s a relatively complex change, it seemed like it would be a good idea to do it at a meeting where there was a press conference.", "Well, at the moment, I think that the expectations of the business community and of the Federal Open Market Committee happen to be pretty well aligned.", "If you look at the financial market indicators, the future federal funds rate path, it\u2019s pretty consistent with the mid -2015 da te-based guidance that we had been providing.", "So I\u2019m not saying there was a major inconsistency between what the business community was expecting, the markets were expecting, and what we were expecting.", "The problem is th at, looking forward, that what happens if there is a significant change either for the better, or for the worse, in the outlook ?", "Under the date -based guidance , that would require the Committee to determine, you know, what the new date is and to make that change in a nontransparent way.", "But under this threshold- based guidance, the markets and the business community can make that calculation on their own and adjust that \u2014their estimates of when rates will begin to increase based only on their own forecast and not have to wait for the Federal Open Market Committee to give them a date.", "Well, the Fed will always, you know, keep\u2014 we\u2019ve innovated quite a bit in the last few years and it \u2019s always possible we could find new ways to provide support for the economy.", "But it\u2019 s certainly true , I\u2019ve \u2014you know, there\u2019s no doubt that with interest rates near zero and with the balance sheet already large, that the ability to provide additional accommodation is n ot unlimited and that that\u2019s just a reality and that actually is an argument, I think, for being a little bit more aggressive now.", "I mean, it\u2019s a really good objective to get the economy moving, to get some momentum that protects the economy against unant icipated shocks that might occur, and gets us off the  zero bound earlier.", "So, exactly for those reasons, the kind of risks that arise when the \u2014when policy interest rates are close to zero, and the  greater difficulty in providing additional policy support, I think that\u2019s an argument for being somewhat more proactive now, when we still have the ability to do that, and to try to get the economy, you know, back to a healthy condition.", "There are a lot of concerns that arose even from, you know, foreign commenters about the effects on their bond markets, et cetera.", "I think the President has got quite a few issues he needs to be thinking about, from fiscal cliff to many other appointments and so on.", "So, on the first question, the chained CPI versus the fixed -weight CPI is a technical issue.", "The chained CPI is technically better, according to most economists, bec ause it allows for changes in the mix of goods and services that people actually consume more effectively.", "However, whether, you know, whether that\u2019s more appropriate for, say, Social Security indexing or not, I think that\u2019s ultimately a political decisio n.  I suppose a rejoinder would be that neither the CPI nor the chained CPI may necessarily be a particularly good measure of the cost of living for Social Security recipients.", "Well, you know, you can see the comparison by looking, for example, at the household survey, which gives estimates of how many people are added to the labor force, how many are added to the employed, how many people are leaving the labor force, and it\u2019s true that part of the decline in unemployment \u2014and indeed all of it in the last reading, but over the recovery, part of the decline in unemployment has come from declines in participation rates, that is, people leaving the labor force.", "Some of that decline in participation appears to be due to longer -run factors, aging and changing patterns of work among women.", "So those things were probably not directly related to the recession, for example.", "But beyond that downward trend, there\u2019s been some additional decline in labor force participation, and in the ratio of employment to population, which presumably is linked to discouragement about the state of the labor force.", "That being said, obviously there has been a good bit of job creation.", "Y ou can see that either in the household survey or in the payroll establishment survey.", "So I think there\u2019s no doubt that the labor market is considerably better today than it was two years ago, there\u2019s not any question about that.", "But it\u2019s also the case t hat many indicators of the labor market remain quite weak, ranging from the number of long -term unemployed to the number of people who have part -time work who would like full -time work.", "Wage growth obviously is very weak, and I could go on.", "So, it may be  that the labor market is even a bit weaker than the current unemployment rate suggests, but I think that it is nevertheless the case that there has been improvement since the trough a couple of years ago.", "Interesting question.", "Well, I certainly hope that markets won\u2019t have to tank.", "I don\u2019t \u2014we want to have confidence, not just in markets but in businesses and households as well, and the best way the fiscal policymakers can achieve that is by coming  to a solution as quickly as possible.", "Markets have obviously already responded to some extent, up and down;  you can see from day to day how they respond to news about the negotiations.", "But on the other hand, it\u2019s also true , if you look at the experience , I think the  very informative experience of the debt limit debate in August of 2011, that both confidence and markets remain pretty sanguine up to pretty close to the point where it looked like there was actually a chance the debt limit would not be raise d.  And then, of course, there was a pretty sharp shock, particularly to confidence, about the time of the, you know, of the final debates.", "So it\u2019s not unusual to see markets being complacent.", "Of course, there\u2019s from a market point of view, there are sor t of risks in both directions.", "Obviously, things go badly, but perhaps if things go especially well, that would be good news, and maybe right now markets are sort of taking an average of those two possibilities.", "But again, just to reiterate, I don\u2019t thin k any policymaker, including the Fed, should be responding to markets.", "What we should be doing is making policy, you know, based on the fundamentals and doing what\u2019s best for the economy and I hope that fiscal policymakers will follow that injunction as w ell.", "The \u2014we\u2019re buying Treasuries and mortgage -backed securities, about half and half, roughly.", "So we\u2019re buying considerably less than the Treasury is issuing and, moreover, the share of outstandi ng Treasuries that the Federal Reserve owns is not all that different from what it was before the crisis, because while our holdings have increased, so has the \u2014obviously the stock of Treasuries in public hands.", "You know, we\u2019ve been increasing our balance sheet now for some time, and we\u2019ve been very clear that this is a temporary measure.", "It\u2019s a way to provide additional accommodation to an economy which needs support.", "We\u2019ve been equally clear that we will normalize the balance sheet, that we will reduce the size of our holdings and\u2014whether by letting them run off or by selling assets in the future.", "It would be quite a different matter if  we were buying these assets and holding them indefinitely.", "There is not any sign either of current inflation or of any \u2014there\u2019s no strong evidence that there are any increases in inflation expectations for that matter, looking at financial markets, looking at surveys, looking at economic forecasts, and so on.", "Remember, I talked earlier about the potential costs of a large balance sheet.", "We want to be sure that there\u2019s no misunderstanding, that there\u2019s no effect on inflation expectations from the size of our balance sheet.", "And I guess it\u2019s worth pointing out \u2014of course we\u2019ve been very focused on the United States December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    33 of 34  here, but we\u2019re not the only central bank that has increased the size of its balance sheet.", "The Japanese, the Europeans, the British have all done the same, and very much more or less to the same extent in terms of the fraction of GDP, and I think the sophisticated market players and the public understand that this is part of a collective need, a need to provide additional accommodation to weak economies and not an accommodation of fiscal policy.", "S o the question is \u2014just to restate your question \u2014is about the spread between the mortgage rates that the public pays and the yields to mortgage -backed securities that banks may hold, and the question is, is that spread widening so that the full benefit of the reduction in MBS yields is not being passed through, that\u2019s the question.", "The first point is that while we don\u2019t expect a hundred percent pass -through of MBS yields to mortgage rates, our empirical and theoretical analysis \u2014and we\u2019ve had quite a bit of work done on this issue \u2014suggests that over time, the great majority of the decline in MBS yields does get passed through to mortgage r ates.", "And indeed, we have seen already a pretty significant decline since September in retail mortgage rates.", "But one thing that\u2019s perh aps confusing this issue a little bit is that there are other things happening in the economy which are affecting those spreads.", "So, for example, ther e are capacity limitations, which are allowing banks to, you know, to charge higher yields, there\u2019s extra  costs like concerns about putback risk, December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    34 of 34  for example.", "There\u2019s higher g -fees.", "So there\u2019s a number of things happening in the economy which will tend, all else equal, to raise that spread between mortgage rates and MBS yields, so that\u2019s unfortunate.", "What we can try to do there, of course, is to try to encourage good policy, for example, on putbacks, that will reduce the perceived risk and cost to the banks of making mortgage loans.", "But again, you know, I think most of those things, like g -fees, for exampl e, are not really in our control, but, again, taking all those issues as constant, it does seem to be the case that, over a period of time, not immediately, but over a period of time, most of the declines in MBS yields do find their way through to mortgage  customers and thereby strengthen the housing
