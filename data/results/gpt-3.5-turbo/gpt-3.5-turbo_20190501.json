has been somewhat weaker.", "Overall, the economy continues  on a healthy path, and the Committee believes that the current stance of policy is appropriate.", "The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and j ob growth, rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment.", "Job gains rebounded in March a fter a weak reading in February  and averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter, well above the pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force.", "Although first -quarter GDP rose more than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed investment slowed.", "Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year.", "The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.", "For much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside considerable slack in resource utilization.", "But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 4 percent, inflation moved up.", "From March through December, core inflation\u2014which excludes volatile food and energy components \u2014was at or very close to 2 percent.", "Overall inflation May 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 2 of 20   fluctuated from a few ten ths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the moves mostly due to changes in energy prices.", "As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system.", "Overall inflation fo r the 12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent.", "Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months.", "Thus, our baseline view remains t hat, with a strong job market and continued growth, inflation wil l return to 2 percent over time  and then be roughly symmetric around our longer -term objective.", "At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents  presented risks to the outlook, including  weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations.", "While concerns remain in all of these areas, it appears that risks have moderated somewhat.", "Global financ ial conditions have eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy and, in some cases , fiscal policy.", "Further, there are reports of progress in the trade talks between the United States and China.", "The Committee views these developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted inflation  pressures , as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in monetary policy.", "Over the past several months, we have made a number of consequential decisions about our balance sheet.", "In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary pol icy using our current policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves.", "In March, we decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff , starting this month, and to cease runoff entirely May 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 3 of 20   in September.", "These plans support our longer -run dual -mandate objectives and also provide clarity about the path of our asset holdings.", "Today we had a preliminary discussion about the longer -run maturity composition of the portfolio.", "Before the financial crisis, our portfolio was weighted toward shorter -term debt of the federal government.", "In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer -term securities with the aim of lowering longer -term interest rates and, thus , supporting the recovery.", "Because of these purchases, our portfolio is now weighted toward longer -term securities.", "As part of normalization, we will have to decide what the maturity structure should be in the longer term.", "This choice raises many complex issues and has possible implications for the stance of policy.", "As we have often emphasized, adjustments to the balance sheet normalization process may well be needed as the process unfolds.", "Final ly, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy :  the interest  rate on excess reserves, or  IOER rate.", "The change does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy.", "We use the IOER rate to help keep the federal funds rate in our target range.", "As balance sheet normalization continues, we have expected that the effective federal funds rate would shift up over time relative to the IOER rate.", "Last year we twice lowered the IOER rate by 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range after the federal funds rate moved toward the top of the range.", "These actions helped keep the effective federal funds rate well within the  target  range.", "The target range for the federal funds rate is our main indicator of the stance of policy, and it remains unchanged.", "So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis.", "As I mentioned, we think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don\u2019 t see a strong case for moving in either direction.", "I would point out that inflation actually ran\u2014including core inflation \u2014actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.", "So we say in our S tatement of Longer -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.", "And I \u2019d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things.", "In addition, the May 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 5 of 20   trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.", "I ndeed, the Dallas trimmed mean is at 2 percent.", "But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent \u2014inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy.", "So as I mentioned, we \u2019ve just come through a two- day meeting , and we\u2019ve done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world and thought about our policy , and we do think our policy stance is appropriate r ight now.", "So \u2014 w e do, of course , though\u2014as a routine matter , as you well know \u2014we look not only at our baseline , but we also look at alternative simulations, both better and worse , and we ask ourselves what the appropriate policy response would be .", "And I would just say that we \u2019re comfortable \u2014the Committee is comfortable with our current policy stance.", "But we do think it \u2019s important that we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range.", "That \u2019s just good monetary policy, good monetary control.", "It really has no implications for policy.", "Ye s, I mean \u2014so , generally speaking, the federal funds rate\u2014we control only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate.", "And the transmission of the federal funds rate into other short -term rates \u2014money market rate s\u2014has been very good over a long period of time.", "And that \u2019s important , because it \u2019s really broader financial conditions that matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate.", "So I think the Fed controlling the federal funds rate is actually important from that standpoint , and I don\u2019 t see us not controlling it.", "So I think we \u2019ll continue to control it , and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial conditions.", "We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for comment every other meeting.", "And I think there haven\u2019 t been a lot of changes since the last meeting , but I \u2019ll just go through the way we think about it.", "First, we \u2019ve developed and published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities \u2014put it out for comment and welcome any feedback that we get from the public.", "So there are four aspects of it that I \u2019ll go through quickly , but I \u2019d say that the headline really is that while there  are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding is that, overall , financial stability vulnerabilities are mod erate, on balance .", "And, in addition, I would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital and liquidity.", "But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices.", "And as for asset prices, some asset prices  are somewhat elevated , but I would say not extremely so.", "Leverage in the financial sector \u2014I mentioned households are actually in good shape from a leverage standpoint.", "Default rates are low.", "Borrowing is relatively low.", "Nonfinancial corporates is an area that we\u2019 ve spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns about that \u2014not so much from a financial stability standpoint , but from the standpoint that having a highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn.", "May 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 8 of 20   And then the last two \u2014the last two things are really about the leverage in the financial system and funding risk, and those are both very, very low by historic standards in the United States.", "So , on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate.", "So we do say that risks to the financial system \u2014we say in our longer -run stat ement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks  to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.", "I would say  that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns a re better \u2014capital liquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that.", "Those are better first -order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.", "So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there.", "And the economy was quite strong and was growing strong.", "The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very positive way.", "And so I think the expectation was that inflat ion would remain up around 2 percent.", "The weak first quarter performance was not expected \u2014of core was not expected , and I don \u2019t think is related to anything we did , in terms of raising rates.", "If infl ation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee , and the Committee would take that into account in making policy.", "I do think it \u2019s important that inflation run close to and sustainably \u2014for a sustained period of time \u2014and symmetrically around 2 p ercent .", "Because if it doesn \u2019t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can\u2014it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside \u2014inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times.", "Inflation, first of all\u2014month- to-month, quarter -to-quarter \u2014is going to move around.", "So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation May 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 10 of 20   expectations are anchored \u2014the thought being , that \u2019s where inflation will go in the long run if it \u2019s not been pushed by those other factors.", "So we also think that slack\u2014the level of slack in the economy does play some small role.", "And , again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up.", "And if it isn \u2019t and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then that\u2019s something we \u2019d take into account in setting policy.", "There \u2019s always the example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of , where I think they \u2019re in year 28 of their expansion.", "All I c an see is that we have an economy where the expansion is continuing.", "Growth is at a healthy level.", "The labor market is strong.", "We see job creation.", "We see wages moving up.", "Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient , and we do expect it  to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent.", "This was before inflation really was under control , but, you know, it\u2019 s very interesting to look at the history.", "I find it quite interesting to look at different periods.", "But I think, in our own cycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really wh at\u2019s relevant for us now.", "Ye s, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution,  and that means we don \u2019t think about short -term political considerations, we don\u2019 t discuss them, and we don\u2019t consider them in making our decisions one way or the other.", "And what we \u2019re alw ays solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent.", "So to give you an idea of what our process is like , maybe as a way of pu tting all that in context \u2014so for the past maybe 10 days, all 17 FOMC members will have made extensive preparations :  catching up on the latest data, reading all the memos, talking to their colleagues and their staff.", "As you also are I \u2019m sure aware, Marty,  we talk to literally thousands of May 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 13 of 20   businesspeople and market people and people in the nonprofit sector and the educational sector just to get a better sense of the economy.", "The first day begins  with an economic briefing, which is , sort of , economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world.", "We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the next day we talk about monetary policy.", "And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous decision , after an extensive discussion , that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is.", "And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we \u2019re going to be patient as we consider adjustments.", "And we also see, by the way, the evolving -risk picture as very consistent with that outlook.", "Ye s.  So you\u2019 re pointing to, really , the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below.", "And it \u2019s just a question, I think, of demographic and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent , and it creates significant challenges.", "One, I would say, is , it means that interest rates will be lower \u2014will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because t hat means lower interest rates.", "And that \u2019s one of the reasons we \u2019re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year \u2014to think about that problem.", "You mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower -for-longe r rates , and that is another challenge.", "As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the extent they threaten achievement of our goals , but we also view, and I do take the view that macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do right through the cycle \u2014those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen.", "Ye s, we see that reading as \u2014it\u2019 s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth.", "So it\u2019s\u2014yes, it \u2019s something tha t we are watching carefully , but we do expect a positive contribution to growth from the manufacturing sector.", "Our outlook and my outlook is for\u2014is a positive one, is a healthy one for the U .S.", "economy for growth for the rest of this year.", "A nd I would say that the basis for that, really , is consumer spending and business investment.", "So if you look at consumer spending, you saw stronger retail sales, stronger motor vehicle sales in March.", "A nd, as I mention ed, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of consumer spending \u2014that\u2019s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, high levels of employment, wages going up.", "All those things are going to support consumer spending.", "So that \u2019s a significant part of the outlook this year.", "And business investment should also be positive in that sort of direction.", "In terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the uncertainty a round these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business sentiment.", "We have been hearing from our business contacts , really , a lot since the beginning of the trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern.", "If you import metals or  whatever for your product or export your product, then it \u2019s been a challenge for you.", "And, of course, most of the gains , though, I would expect, even from a successful trade negotiation, would come in over time.", "You know, I don\u2019t think\u2014i t wouldn\u2019 t be the kind of thing where you \u2019d immediately feel big effects right away , but they could be quite important over a May 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 16 of 20   longer period.", "Let me say, I don \u2019t mean to diminish concerns about too- low inflation , but I think there \u2019s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors.", "One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag.", "And so when asset prices went back up, probably there\u2019 ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.", "Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel , and apparel prices were very, very low.", "And another way to look at it is , there are models that look at inflation in different ways , like\u2014not models, but measures , like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned.", "So trimmed mean\u2014it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories , and it didn\u2019 t go down at all.", "It\u2019s at 2 percent \u2014or it\u2019s at, I don\u2019 t know whether it went down  or was above that , but it \u2019s at 2 percent now.", "Many of you wil l remember , in March of 2017, there was a May 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 17 of 20   very low reading for cell phone services \u2014mobile phone services \u2014and it was kind of a price war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year , but it did not look like something that would be repeated.", "And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation.", "We \u2019re going to be watching \u2014really, I \u2019d like to say we\u2019re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that t hese things are transient , and I \u2019ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective.", "Ye s, it\u2019s hard to say , because there\u2019 s so many other variable s.
