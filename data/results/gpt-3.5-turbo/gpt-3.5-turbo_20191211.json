announced in December.1  These technical operations are aimed at maintaining an ample level of reserves and addressing money marke t pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy.", "Our operations have gone well so far; pressures in money markets over recent weeks have been subdued.", "To address possible pressures in money markets over the year -end, we

that \u2019s\u2014what \u2019s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization , or unemployment , and infl ation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years.", "If you go back 50 years , you would have seen that, when there was \u2014when labor markets were tight and unemployment was low, inflation moved right up.", "And then as the Fed got control of inflation, the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker, to the point where there \u2019s still a connection, but it\u2019s \u2014it\u2019 s a very faint one.", "And I \u2014what that suggests is that you                                                  1 Chair Powell intended to say the repurchase operations were announced in October.", "December 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL

order to drive up inflation.", "I mean, we \u2014the \u2014again , the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak , has been weak.", "So it \u2019s much, much lower than it used to be , but I don\u2019 t know that it \u2019s gone down any more in the last decade .", "If you look\u2014look at where wages were three  or four  years ago, they were running around 2 percent.", "And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up to 3 and 3\u00bd percent , and that suggests tightening.", "The same thing is true , but much less true , of inflation, the relationship between \u2014in a way , the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient than the price Phillips curve does.", "So there \u2019s similarities, conceptual similarities , I think , between th e two instances during that long expansion, I guess in \u201995 and \u2019 98, when the Fed cut three times only to resume raising rates.", "And the notion just is that it \u2019s a\u2014the economy needed slightly more accommodative policy , but it wasn \u2019t the end of the expansion, right?", "So this is that we did, in fact , turn out to do three rate cuts .", "What \u2019s diffe rent is , you have a very different \u2014you have very different structural characteristics in the economy , particularly around inflation.", "So now, as you can see , inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50- year lows and expected t o remain there.", "So the need for rate increases is less.", "And , by the way, this is \u2014it\u2019s a good thing that , you know, we think we can \u2014I think we \u2019ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upwa rd pressure on inflation.", "In fact, we need some upward pressure o n inflation to get back to 2 percent.", "So I guess I want to start by stressing that these are very important operational matters but that are not like ly to have any macroeconomic implications.", "We \u2019d decided back in January to remain an ample -reserves regime, and that means we will be setting the federal funds rate \u2014the range for the federal funds rate through our administered rates and not through active  management of the level of reserves.", "And the purpose of all this, let \u2019s remember, is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be transmitted to the federal funds rate, which in turn affects other short -term rates.", "The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all volatility , particularly in the repo market.", "So, taking you back, this \u2014as you know , we h ad very gradually allowed the balance sheet to shrink, we slowed that gradual pace by half in March, and then we ended it in July.", "Meanwhile, we had surveyed all of the banks, and particularly the large banks who hold a lot of the reserves,  and said , \u201cWha t\u2019s your lowest comfortable level of reserves?", "And yet we saw , actually , in September that reserves \u2014the markets acted as though reserves had become scarce.", "So what had happened was that liquidity , which actually existed , didn \u2019t flow into the repo market , and that had effects on the federal funds rate.", "We \u2019re open to ideas for modifying supervisory and regulatory practice in ways that don \u2019t undermine safety and soundness , and a number of ideas are under \u2014under  examination there.", "To go through it sort of by\u2014in time, we started off , really , on September  17 with overnight operations .", "I think , for the last couple of months, repo markets have been functioning well, short -term rates are stable, markets are functioning.", "T emporary upward pressures  on short -term money market rates are not unusual around year -end.", "And our \u2014both our repo operations and Treasury bill purchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal funds rate.", "We think that the pressures appear manageable, and we stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.", "Our strategy has been \u2014essentially , the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term through\u2014through both overnight and term repo, a nd, at the same time, we \u2019re raising the underlying level of reserves through bill purchases.", "We\u2019ve said bills \u2014bill purchases.", "We\u2019ve also said that we were willing to ad apt our strategy.", "We \u2019re not at this place , but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short -term coupon securities, then we would be prepared to do that if \u2014if the need arises.", "It looks \u2014it very much looks li ke the bill \u2014so those bill purchases are going well , just according to expectations.", "I mean, the other thing I \u2019ll say is that we \u2019re in, you know, very regular contact with market participants all the time.", "We\u2019 re\u2014we\u2019re  focused on\u2014on year -end as well and prepared to adjust our operations as appropriate.", "So, on the standing repo facility, as you know , we\u2019ve actually had a couple of meetings where we\u2019 ve discussed that.", "I think the standing repo facility is something that\u2019ll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place.", "I should also mention that after the  year -end, the sense of it is that as the underlying level of reserves moves up because of bill purchases , as that happens , there will come a time when it will be appropriate for overnight and term repo to gradually decline.", "Well, as I mentioned , actually , at the last press conference, we think our policy rate is appropriate and will remain appropriate as long as incoming data are broadly in keeping with our \u2014with our  outlook.", "And in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that\u2019 s persistent and that \u2019s significant \u2014a significant move -up in inflation that \u2019s also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns.", "We haven \u2019t\u2014we haven\u2019t  tried to turn it into some sort of, you know, official forward guidance.", "It happens to be my view that that \u2019s what it would take to want to move interest rates up in order to deal with inflation.", "I think what you\u2019 re seeing is, you\u2019 ve got a full year of the median being flat , which is , we think, accommodative, modestly accommodat ive, and inflation not moving up very much, as we\u2019 ve discussed.", "And that underscores , I think , the challenge of getting inflation to move up.", "The C ommittee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent, squarely at 2 percent , for\u2014ever since I arrived in 2012.", "And it hasn \u2019t happened, and it \u2019s just \u2014it\u2019s because there are disinflationary forces around the world , and they\u2019 ve been stronger than, I think , people understood them to be.", "In terms of those out -year rate increases, what \u2019s you\u2019 re\u2014you \u2019re looking at rate in creases more than a year into the future , and, you know, people will have their own explanations for why they do that, but we \u2014really, none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like in 2021.", "So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that , over time , it would be appropriate \u2014if you believe that the neutral rate is 2\u00bd percent , it would be appropriate for your rates to move up in that direction.", "I will also say to you that a number of people wrote down, and you can\u2019 t see this at this level of detail,  but\u2014today \u2014but a number of people did write down overshoots of inflation as appropriate \u2014under appropriate policy.", "Well, it \u2019s just that there is still, empirically , by many, many different \u2014by the work of many different analysts , there is a relationship between resource utilization , by which I mean unemployment , and i nflation .", "T hat means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good\u2014in some dimensions \u2014labor market without having to worry about inflation.", "It also means, though, that it\u2019 s not easy to move inflation up.", "Now, you say, why is there confidence?", "I mean, I would say there \u2019s more humility than there is confidence in this at this point.", "It \u2019s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target.", "And I would also point out that this year , which has been a good year for the economy, inflation \u2014core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent, whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year.", "So it\u2019s \u2014it\u2019s a real challenge, and\u2014 but I think we \u2019re using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge.", "Well, I \u2014you know, I think the answer to the questio n of whether saying it is enough to create credibility, the answer  to that is \u201c no.\u201d  And I think you have to back that up with policy that supports the outcome , and that \u2019s what we \u2019re trying to do.", "And so the \u2014the changes that we \u2019re looking at to the framew ork are \u2014I think they take all of that on board, and\u2014but they\u2019 re\u2014what they\u2019 re\u2014what they are  designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of that\u2014of that  inflation target, but only if followed by policy.", "Ultimately, it will take time to establish \u2014to move  inflation expectations up from where they are , which appears to be a bit below 2 percent , will not happen overnight .", "You know, the Fed has great inflation credibility , but inflation expectations ar e anchored at about their 25- year average, which is a few ticks below 2 percent.", "Well, I did see the news today that it appears there \u2019s an agreement to move forward to vot e on USMCA, and, of course , it\u2019s not our role to comment on particular trade policies or criticize them one way or the other or evaluate them.", "I will say , though, that getting\u2014if the deal were to be enacted , then it would certainly remove some of the trade policy December 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 of 26  uncertainty, and that would be , I believe , a positive for the economy.", "We\u2019ve been hearing from our people that we talked to\u2014the many, many people and businesses that we talked to in\u2014through the Reserve Banks that wind up being written up in the Beige Book, and they\u2019 ve been telling us all year \u2014for a year and a half , really , that trade policy uncertainty is weighing on the outlook.", "And I do think that, again, without commenting on it \u2014in any way on the process or the content of the agreement, I think tha t uncertainty \u2014removal of uncertainty around that would be a positive for the economy as well.", "Well , I thin k you can\u2014you know, it \u2019s\u2014I think you can see that what \u2019s been moving\u2014one way to look at it is , what \u2019s been moving financial markets ?", "So the \u2014you know, the focus really is on how to use our strategi es, tools , and communications to achieve both sides of the mandate.", "And you\u2019 re right, though, that we \u2019ve talked here a lot about inflation.", "And I think that the \u2014I think , more broadly, over a period of years \u2014many years \u2014we \u2019ve been learning that the natural  rate of unemployment is lower .", "It\u2019s just been \u2014it\u2019 s in estimates not just at the Fed , but among \u2014broadly among economists \u2014labor economists have seen that the connection \u2014that we can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought .", "And, as I  mentioned, that\u2019s a good thing because that means we\u2014we  don\u2019 t have to worry so much about inflation.", "And that \u2019s\u2014and you see the benefits of that in today \u2019s labor market.", "I\u2014you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they are about maximum employment.", "If you\u2019ve \u2014if you\u2019ve  listen ed to or attended any of those, the discussion \u2014we always focus on inflation as well , but the discussion is really around what \u2019s happening in low - and moderate -income communities and among small businesses.", "But it was help to get \u2014helpful to get it in  the context of a monetary policy review.", "And I think that the fact that these communities have so much\u2014such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there.", "And I think that does also infor m our understanding of what we mean by \u201cmaximum employment .\u201d And it\u2019s been a very positive \u2014I would say that the Fed Listens  events have been \u2014have been  extraordinarily positive , and they\u2019 re certainly something w e\u2019ll repeat.", "You also see from December 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 15 of 26  the business p erspective that companies are taking all kinds of measures to \u2014you know, to look through things on people \u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that would have perhaps disqualified them in other kinds of environments, training is moving up\u2014you hear just a lot \u2014there are a lot of things  going on that suggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances, which is a great thing.", "You know, I \u2014I think we have kind of internalized \u2014and this isn\u2019 t\u2014this isn\u2019t news for today, this is something we \u2019ve been saying for, you know, for several years \u2014you\u2019ve seen us moving down our estimates of the \u2014of maximum employment.", "In fact , it\u2019s already \u2014it\u2019s already understood, I think, that \u2014that  there \u2019s more \u2014even though we \u2019re at 3\u00bd percent unemployment , there \u2019s actually more slack out there, in a sense.", "A nd\u2014and the risks of, you know, using accommodative monetary policy, our tool , to explore that are relatively low.", "So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we \u2019ve done a ton of work on that.", "We\u2019ve talked to supervisors , and\u2014it \u2019s interesting, if you look at the banks, they\u2019 re all over the place on the composition of their \u2014of their  buffer.", "So you have to have \u2014you have a business model , and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be , and that suggests what your buffer should be.", "Some of them have lots of reserves and, you know, fewer T reasuries, and then they change their mind

taken it as exogenous.", "I don\u2019 t know that at some point we won\u2019 t have those discussions , but, you know, Treasury \u2014we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs.",

\u2014the bill purchases, t he year -end, and also the review of supervisory and regulatory issues that we \u2019re digging into, and\u2014because we think, you know, there \u2019s\u2014these are structural things \u2014right?", "\u2014where you could, without sacrificing safety and soundness, just allow the \u2014allow the  liquidity that is already there to flow more freely , perhaps by making fairly straightforward, noncontroversial changes .", "These things that we\u2019 re working on now , though\u2014like, you know, going through year-end with the overnight facilities and the  bill purchases and the term repo\u2014those are \u2014those are things we have to do right now and are doing.", "Well, we did , actually \u2014if you look at the statement, you\u2019 ll notice that we \u2014we  did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the statement.", "But those are \u2014those are  just key things , and they haven\u2019 t gone away , so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there \u2014still subject to the idea that, for us to change our stance, we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook.", "So,  I mean,  one thing that we \u2019re mindful of is that we \u2019ve cut rates three times since Ju ly.", "And we do believe that monetary December 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 of 26  policy operates with long and variable lags , and that it will take some time before the full effects of those actions are seen in the economy.", "In fact, if you look at\u2014more broadly at the Treasury yield curve, it has moved more than 75 basis points.", "So you\u2019ve\u2014you\u2019ve  had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation.", "In terms of what \u2019s\u2014you know, what is material at the end of the day, w ell, I would just say, whether or not a change in the outlook merits a policy response will be a collective judgme nt of the FO", "We had an economy
