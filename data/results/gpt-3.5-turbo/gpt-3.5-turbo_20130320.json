["The Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two- day meeting earlier today.", "As always, my colleagues and I review ed recent economic and financial developments and discuss ed the economic outlook.", "The data since our January meeting  have been generally consistent  with our expectation that the fourth -quarter pause in the recovery w ould prove temporary  and that moderate economic growth w ould resume.", "Spending by households and businesses has continued to expand, and the housing sector has seen  further gains .", "The jobs market has  also shown signs of improvement  over the past six  month s or so :  Private payrolls are growing more quickly , total hours of work have increased, the  rate of filings of  new claims for unemployment insurance has fallen , and the unemployment rate has continued to tick down.", "However, at 7.7 percent, t he unemployme nt rate remains elevated.", "The Committee also remains concerned  that restrictive fiscal policies may  slow economic growth and job creation in coming months.", "We continue to monitor the recent increase s in gasoline prices, which appear to be due mostly to passing factors such as refinery shutdowns for maintenance.", "Apart from temporary variations in energy prices, i nflation is  running somewhat below the Committee\u2019s longer -run objective of 2 percent .", "Importantly , longer -term inflation expectations remain stable .", "Overall, still-high unemployment , in combination with relatively low inflation , underscores the need  for policies that will support progress toward s maximum employment in a context of price stabi lity.", "In conjunction with this meeting, the 19 participants in our policy discussion\u2014the 7 Board m embers and 12 Reserve Bank p residents \u2014submitted individual economic projections .", "March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   2 of 26 As always, each participant\u2019s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of  appropriate monetary policy.", "To summarize, the participants\u2019  projections for economic growth ha ve a central tendency of 2.3 to 2.8 percent  for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.7 percent  in 2015.", "T he central tendency of their  projections  of the unempl oyment rate for the fourth quarter of this  year is  7.3 to 7.5 percent , declining to 6.0 to 6.5 percent  in the final quarter of 2015.", "M ost participants see inflation  gradually increasing toward the  Committee\u2019s longer -run target; the central tendency of their projections for inflation is  1.3 to 1.7 percent this year and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2015.", "As you already know from the policy statement, we are continuing the asset purchase program  first announced in September .", "This decision was supported by our  review at the meeting of the likely efficacy, costs, and risks of additional  purchases.", "Although estimates  of the efficacy of the Federal Reserve\u2019s asset purchases are necessarily uncertain, most participants agreed that these purchases \u2014by putting downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, including mortgage rates \u2014continue to provide meaningful support to economic growth and job creation.", "However, most also agreed that this monetary tool would likely not be able on its own t o fully offset  major  economic headwinds, such as those that might arise from significant near -term fiscal restraint or from  a sharp  increase in global financial stresses .", "We also had a tho rough discussion of possible costs and risks of continued expansion of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet.", "The risks include  possible  adverse implications of additional purchases for  the functioning of securities markets, and the potential effects \u2014under various scenarios \u2014of a larger balance sheet on the Federal Reserve\u2019s earnings from its asset holdings and, hence, on its remittances to the Treasury.", "The C ommittee also considered  possible March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   3 of 26 risks to financial stability, such as  might arise if persistently low  rates lead some market  participants to take on excessive risk in a \u201creach for yield .\u201d  In the Committee\u2019s view, these costs remain manageable but will continu e to be monitor ed, and we will take them into appropriate account as we determine the size, pace, and composition of our  asset purchases.", "As for today, our policy decision had two main elements.", "First , the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage -backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer -term Tr easury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.", "It bears emphasizing  that the Committee has described this pr ogram in terms of a monthly pace  of purchases, rather  than as a total amount of expected purchases, and has tie d the evolution of the progra m to economic criteria\u2014specifically, to the achievement of a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.", "Within this framework , the Committee could vary the pace of purchases as progress is made toward i ts economic o bjectives  or if its assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program changes .", "At this meeting , the Committee judged that no adjustment was warranted.", "Second , the Committee kept the target for the federal funds rate at 0 to \u00bc percent  and reaffirmed its expectation  that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy  will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens .", "In particular, we  anticipate that this exceptiona lly low range  for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6\u00bd percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half  percentage point above the Committee\u2019s longer -run infl ation goal of 2 percent, and longer -term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored .", "March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   4 of 26 I should note , as I have on other occasions, that the economic conditions provided in this forward guidance are thresholds, not triggers.", "Crossing one or more of these thresholds  will not lead automatically to an increase in rates.", "Rather, the Committee will assess at that time whether the outlook just ifies raising its target for the federal funds rate.", "This guidance will help market participants assess how th e Federal Reserve\u2019s interest  rate policy is likely to respond to economic developments, but its broader purpose  is to assure households and businesses that monetary policy will continue to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job creation picks up.", "In their individual projections, 14 of the 19 FOMC participants saw the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate as occurring in 2015 or 2016.", "Let me comment  briefly on how the two main pieces of our policy accommodation\u2014asset purchases and guidance about future changes in the federal funds rate \u2014fit together.", "The  purpose of the asset purchases is to increase the economy\u2019s near -term momentum, with the goal of improving the outlook for the labor market and helping to promot e a self -sustaining recovery  with price stability .", "The forward rate guidance, in turn, provides information about when the Committee will begin consider ing the removal of policy accommodation through increases  in the target for the federal funds rate.", "Importantly, the Committee expects a considerable interval  to pass between the time when the Committee will cease adding accommodation  through asset purchases  and the time when it will be appropriate to begin removing accommodation by moving the federal fund s rate target  toward more normal levels.", "As always, in deciding on the appropriate stance of policy, t he Committee will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer -run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.", "In sum, the Committee  anticipates moderate economic growth, supported by household and business spending and a strengthening housing sector.", "T he labor market has shown signs of March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   5 of 26 improvement in recent months, but the  unemployment rate remains elevated .", "Inflation is expected to  remain low , and fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive.", "In light of its  outlook, and following a review of the efficacy and costs of additional asset purchases, the Committee today reaffirmed its asset purchase program and  its federal funds g uidance.", "On the one  hand, we have benefits, which are associated with improvements in the economy, but there are also costs associated with unconventional policy, such as potential effects o n financial stability, which are hard to quantify and which people have different vie ws about.", "So , to this point, we \u2019ve not been able to give quantitative thresholds for the asset purchases in the same way that we have for the federal funds rate target.", "We \u2019re going to continue to try to provide information as we go forward.", "In particula r, as I mentioned today, as we make progress towards our objective, we may adjust the flow rate of purchases month to month to appropriately calibrate the amount of accommodation we\u2019re providing given the outlook for the labor market.", "In terms of further color, again, given the complexity of the issue, we \u2019ve not given quantitative analysis or quantitative thresholds.", "I would say that we \u2019ll be looking for sustained March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   6 of 26 improvement in a range of key labor market indicators, including , obviously , payrolls, unemployment rate, but also others like the hiring rate, claims for unemployment insurance, quit rates, wage rates, and so on.", "We \u2019ll be looking for sustained improvement across a range of indicators , and in a way that \u2019s taking place throughout the economy.", "And since we \u2019re looking at the outlook\u2014we \u2019re looking at the prospects rather than the current state of the labor market \u2014 we\u2019ll also be looking at things like growth to try to understand whether there \u2019s sufficient momentum in the economy to pr ovide demand for labor going forward.", "So that will allow us to look through, perhaps, some temporary fluctuations associated with short- term shocks or problems.", "That would be , I think, very difficult for the markets to understand, to anticipate.", "We think it makes more sense to have our policy variable , which is the rate of flow of purchases , respond in a more continuous or sensitive way to changes in the outlook.", "So, as we make progress towards our ultimate objective of substantial improvement, we may adjust the rate of flow of purchases accordingly.", "Now, we won \u2019t do that every meeting ; we won \u2019t do that frequently .", "But when we see that the condition or the situation has changed in a  meaningful way, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   7 of 26 consistent with the outlook, a nd, secondly, to help provide the markets with some sense of progress \u2014how much progress is being made so that it can make better judgments.", "Well, you know, as I just described what I mean by \u201csubstantial improvement,\u201d  it\u2019s a broad -based improvement in a range of indicators as well as improvement in output and  labor demand.", "So, as we move \u2014we see partial improvements, see modest improvement , as we see a per iod in which the labor market is doing better, and we have reason to think it might be stronger, then we might reduce accommodation at that point.", "If, subsequently , the labor market were to weaken, the outlook were to get worse, we could, of course , bring back accommodation back to the previous level.", "Well, that\u2019 s going to be obviously a decision that the Committee has to make , and we will \u2014at each meeting, we\u2019 ll look at progress  that\u2019s been made since the last meeting, try to assess the outlook, try to dete rmine whether there \u2019s been a sufficient change to warrant  a change in our policy stance.", "Internally, we \u2019ll use models and other indicators of the state of the labor market to try to make a good estimate of how much we need to change the rate of flow.", "But, again, the point of this is to let the market see our behavior , to let them see how we respond to changes in the outlook.", "A nd that way there will be a better ability, I March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   8 of 26 hope, for the markets to anticipate either a return to higher levels of purchases or the ultimate phasing -out of the program.", "The last five months, for example, we \u2019ve seen over 200,000 jobs a month in the private sector .", "Unemployment rate  has come down four -tenths since September.", "Unemployment claims, insurance claims are at the lowest level they \u2019ve been since the crisis, so we are seeing improvement.", "So , we\u2019ve seen periods before where we had as many as 300,000 jobs for a couple of months, and then things weakened again.", "You \u2019ve got a situation where the banking system is a large multiple of  the size of the March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   9 of 26 economy.", "And so, in the financial sense, it \u2019s bigger than it is i n a GDP sense.", "And it \u2019s a difficult problem because the country faces both fiscal and bank capitalization issues.", "And you\u2019ve seen that there \u2019s political stress in terms of trying to figure out how they \u2019re going to meet the demands of the euro group for contributing to their rescue.", "So, there are a lot of uncertainties and difficulties , and there \u2019s questions about how \u2014the way Cyprus is treated , what implications that might have for other countries and the like.", "But , having said that, you know, the vote failed and the markets are up today , and I don \u2019t think that the impact has been enormous.", "We are monitoring very carefully, but , at this point, we \u2019re not seeing a major risk to the U .S.", "financial system or the U.S. economy.", "It\u2019s pretty difficult to control for all the factors that go into determining the size of the subsidy.", "I think there is some evidence that financial markets are, at least to some extent, taking into account the possibility that large financial institution s will fail.", "You see, for example, spreads in the credit default swaps that  indicate some probabi lity of failure.", "You see some discrimination among different institutions according to the bond market \u2014interest rates that they get charged , and so on.", "So there is some evidence of market discrimination.", "We\u2019re putting in the Basel capital standards.", "And I hope that  we\u2019ll make March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   10 of 26 progress against too- big-to-fail, because I agree with her 100 percent that it \u2019s a real problem and needs to be addressed if at all possible.", "I\u2019ll certainly be informing the Wall Street Journal  and other publications if I come to some decision or som e developments in that front.", "In terms of term limits, I don \u2019t have a strong view on that.", "So, in that respect, term limits are redundant.", "And , indeed, if you had term limits on the Fed Chairman , that would be , I think, the only office in the federal government besides P resident and Vice P resident that would have that restriction.", "My 10- year term , of course , is not as Chairman.", "My 10- year remaining term is as a G overnor , so that\u2019s not relevant , really , to the question that you asked about.", "But I come from a small town in South Carolina that has taken a big hit from the recession.", "Last time I was there, the unemployment rate was about 15 percent.", "I have great concern about the unemployed both for their own sake , but also because the loss of skills, the loss of labor force attachment is bad for our whole economy.", "So I think it \u2019s very, very important that we act to address unemployment , and I think the Federal Reserve\u2014 I think most people would agree \u2014the Federal Reserve has been fairly active in that regard.", "In terms of costs, there are a number of different  costs , and I mentioned some of them in my remarks.", "I think one that has recently been discussed\u2014Governor Stein brought it up in a speech \u2014is the issue of financial stability.", "Clearly, financial in stability , if it were allowed to be sufficiently serious , would be a threat to employment, a threat to jobs , and a threat to production.", "So, obviously, given the experience of the past few years, we want to be sure that we \u2019re not unnecessarily encouraging excessive risk -taking or other problems in the financial  markets.", "We do address that through a number of means , including monitoring the financial system, regulation , supervision, communication, and the like .", "But this is a potential concern that a March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   12 of 26 number of my colleagues are worried about , and it \u2019s one of the  things we talked about in our discussion of the costs and risks of balance sheet policies.", "And part of the concern is \u2014is that as we go forward , we\u2014you know, we \u2019ll have to factor in the efficacy , which is another issue.", "I mean, there\u2019 s a wide range of views about how effective asset purchases are in terms of moving the economy.", "So , as we move forward in time, we\u2019 ll be learning about how effective the p olicy is , and what cost s and risks  there may be associated with it.", "And I agree with you 100 percent that that would be more effective if we could give numerical guidance.", "But, you know, I think the Federal Reserve has come a long way.", "You know, in 1994, we didn\u2019 t even tell people when we changed the federal funds rate.", "Now, we \u2019re telling you when\u2014 you know, what the state of the economy is going to be when we raise the federal funds rate.", "So, we are making progress in terms of forward guidance.", "Well, I think capital is an important element in addressing too-big-to-fail.", "One of the things that will be proposed, and is not in effect yet , will be surcharges on the largest banks \u2014that is , the largest financial institutions will have to hold more capital as a percent of their risk -weighted assets than smaller banks do.", "That will increase their cost of funding and, to some extent , will both equalize their cost of funding with other banks and make them safer so that the risk of their failure is limited.", "In terms of the financing, it is true, I think, that excessive reliance on short -term uninsured funding does present some risks.", "And both in our 165\u2013166 rule and now through Basel III, we will be putting forward restrictions on the kinds of financing , the limits on how much illiquidity and liquidity risk firms can take.", "We need to keep assessing that , and we \u2019ll be able to tell by looking at market indicators , by doing our own stress test s and the like.", "And if we don\u2019 t, you know, if we don\u2019t achieve the goal, I think we \u2019ll have to do additional steps.", "Well, the tightening of credit in mortgage markets \u2014I mean, our sense is that it \u2019s gone too far.", "I mean, some tightening was obviously needed.", "There were people who bought houses prior to the crisis who really couldn\u2019 t sustain a mortgage.", "So , terms and conditions have been tightened up, and we \u2019re now seeing much higher credit quality requirements on potential borrowers.", "We are concerned that a variety of factors , such as concerns about putbacks the banks may have , uncertainties about regulation \u2014which we \u2019re working on to get done as quickly as possible \u2014may have tightened the mortgage credit box more than would be desirable in a long -run healthy economy.", "That does have some effect on monetary policy.", "One of the most powerful tools we have is bringing down mortgage rates and stimulating homebuying , construction, and related industries.", "I would say one thing , which is that as the housing industry has strengthened and home prices have gone up, that has actually brought some people into the credit box in the sense that the number of people, for example, who are underwater on their mortgages is declining as house prices go up.", "So , as people have bigger down payments, bigger equity in their homes, they become more creditworthy.", "So, to some extent, not \u2014I don\u2019 t want to overstate it\u2014but to some extent, monetary  policy \u2014by strengthening the housing market , helping support house prices \u2014is bringing more people into the mortgage market.", "We \u2019re not targeting asset prices.", "We \u2019re not measuring success in terms of the stock market.", "We\u2019re measuring success in terms of our mandate, wh ich is employment and price stability , and that \u2019s what we\u2019 re trying to achieve.", "We do monitor the entire financial system, not just the parts that we supervise or regulate.", "It includes the stock market and other asset markets.", "And I don\u2019 t want to , now , be pulled into going through every individual financial market and assessing it.", "But, in the stock market, you know, we don\u2019 t see at this point anything that\u2019 s out of line with historical patterns.", "In particular, you should remember , of course , that while the Dow may be hitting a high, it\u2019 s in nominal term s, it\u2019s not in real terms.", "And if you adjust for inflation and for the growth of the economy, you know, we \u2019re still some distance from the high.", "I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s all that surprising that the stock market would rise , given that there has been increased optimism about the economy and the share of income going to profits has been very high.", "P rofit increases have been substantial, and the relationship between stock prices and earnings is not particularly unusual at this point.", "Well, our analysis is fairly comparable to analysis that the Congressional Budget Office has presented to the Congress.", "And they estimate that putting together all the fiscal measures , including the f iscal c liff deal,  the s equester, and other cuts, that federal f iscal restraint in 2013 is cutting something like 1\u00bd percentage points off of growth, which, of course, is very significant.", "We \u2014you know, we take as given what the fiscal authorit ies are doing.", "The economy is weaker.", "Job creation is slower than it would be otherwise.", "And so, that is one of the reasons that our policy has been as aggressive as it is.", "That being said, as I \u2019ve said many times, monetary policy cannot offset a fisca l restraint of that magnitude , and so the final outcome will be wors e\u2014or, in terms of jobs \u2014than would have been the case with less fiscal restraint.", "I want to emphasize that I do believe that long -term fiscal stability is extremely important.", "And I urge Congress  and the  Administration , as I always do, when I go to testify to do whatever is necessary to put us on a sustainable fiscal path going forward.", "But , in doing so, I think it \u2019s a good idea to pay attention to the impact in the near term on what is s till not a completely satisfactory recovery.", "There\u2019 s been some disconnect , at least in the sh ort run , between unemployment rate changes and March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   17 of 26 growth during this recovery, and there \u2019ve been periods , at least , where unemployment has fallen relatively quickly even though growth has been more limited.", "So we \u2019re just going to have to monitor developments  in the economy and see what happens.", "You \u2019re right that we \u2019re not forecasting extraordinarily strong growth.", "But it is also true , as you \u2014I think, you noted, that our projections for unemployment in the fourth quarter are noticeably lower than they were i n September when we first announced this asset purchase program.", "So there has been some improvement in the outlook, as measured by that metric.", "And , normally, you would expect that you would need to see a reasonable pace of GDP growth in order to achieve that.", "So we \u2019re just going to have to keep providing support for the economy and see \u2014you know, see how things evolve.", "Well, the reason for publishing the seve rely adverse scenario, of course, is that \u2019s the ultimate acid test, you know, whether the banks are sufficiently March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   18 of 26 capitalized.", "So , I think, in terms of evaluating the health of the banks, the severely adverse scenario is the right one.", "For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest  rate risk and interest rate sensitivity  and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long -term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time.", "Well, as yo u point out, we \u2019re at the zero lower bound, and that makes further accommodation not impossible but more difficult and harder to predict , and March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   19 of 26 with more side effects that are difficult to predict.", "We have \u2014as you know, we have given this guideline for \u2014so we call them signposts for how the funds rate is going to evolve over time.", "And , as a lot of academic research shows, you know, when you\u2019 re close to the zero lower bound, by telling markets that you\u2019re going to keep rates low for a significant period, that \u2019s one way to get longer -term rates down and to provide more stimulus to the economy.", "We could lower even further , say, the unemployment rate number that we hit.", "But for right now, we find that the thresholds that we have put into that rate guidance seem to be sufficient to approx imate the \u2014what \u2019s called the optimal c ontrol path of i nterest r ates, that it seems to give a path of unemployment and inflation that \u2019s about as good as we can get with the monetary policy tools that we have.", "It just means that we don\u2019 t have enough fire power to get the economy back to full employment more quickly.", "So you\u2019 re talking about the inflation target, basically.", "So , historically, the argument for having inflation greater than zero \u2014we define price stability as 2 percent inflation , as do most central March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   20 of 26 banks around the world.", "And one might ask, \u201cWell, price stability should be zero inflation.", "Why do you choose 2 percent instead of zero?", "\u201d  And the answer  is, the question you\u2019 re raising , which is that if you have zero inflation, you\u2019 re very close to the deflation zone , and nominal interest rates will be so low that it would be very difficult to respond fully to recessions.", "And so, historical experience has  suggested that 2 percent is an appropriate balance between the cost of inflation and the cost that you\u2019 re referring to.", "But it\u2019s an interesting question to try to quantify.", "Certainly, the financial system has \u2014I could argue two ways.", "economy grew pretty well between 1945 and 1975 or 1980.", "And the financial system was much simpler and didn\u2019 t have a lot of exotic derivatives and so on.", "So that would be \u2014that would be one way to argue that maybe, you know, all of this  extra financial activity is not justified.", "There \u2019s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services , and so on.", "So, I think, based on that and based on the innovations that information technology have created in lots of industries, you would expect financial services to be some what bigger.", "I think that my predecessor Paul Volcker \u2019s claim that the only contribution to the financial industry is the a utomatic t eller m achine might be a little exaggerated.", "I think that a somewhat bigger financial sector can be justified by the wider range of services and the more globalized financial economic system that we have.", "I think the issue they face is that there\u2019 s a pretty big hole, a financial hole, in the sense that there is a fiscal issue and there \u2019s also a bank restructuring recapitalization issue.", "I think everyone understands that there are certain risks with that besides the equity issue of taxing lower -income people.", "There is the issue of setting a pre cedent that might reduce confidence in banks in subsequent periods.", "But I don\u2019 t envy them that particular challenge.", "Because of the severity of the recession in 2007 to 2009, the seasonals got distorted.", "And they may have led \u2014and I say \u201c may\u201d because the statistical experts \u2014many of them deny it, but it\u2019 s possible that they led job creation and GDP to be exaggerated to some extent early in the year.", "Our assessment is, though, that at this point, that we \u2019re far enough away from the recession that those seasonal factors ought to be pretty much washing out by now.", "So if we do , in fact , see a slump, it would probably be due to real fundamental causes  and then we would obviously have to respond to that.", "As I said , we\u2019re planning to adjust our tools to respond to changes in the outlook, a nd that can go either direction.", "Well, as someone mentioned, Cyprus is a tiny economy , and I don\u2019 t think that these issues , as worrisome as they are and as concerned as we would be for March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   23 of 26 the Cypriote people , I don\u2019 t think that they have direct implications for the U .S.", "economy.", "The only way that they would create a problem would be if the runs became contagious in some sense, if depositors in other countries lost confidence.", "And, indeed, it is quite unusual to have a banking sector as large as they have relative to thei r economy.", "In terms of the United States, you know, the FDIC was founded, I think, in 1934, a nd insured deposits , and they\u2019re very proud of the fact that no one \u2019s ever lost a dime in insured deposits.", "Long -term unemployment is one dimension of the unemployment problem.", "But I think that probably the best way to get the long -term unemployed back to work is to get an overall strong labor market.", "And I think that \u2019s\u2014we \u2019d be looking at the overall key indicators like overall unemployment rate, payrolls and hiring, and some of the other things that I mentioned.", "Labor force participation, yes .", "Labor force participation has been declining on a trend- like basis in the United States for a while.", "That \u2019s the result , mostly , of demographic factors , partly the aging of the population, partly the fact that female participation is no longer increasing \u2014it\u2019 s in fact decreasing a little bit.", "It\u2019s also the case that labor force attachment within people of
