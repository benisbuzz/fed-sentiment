["I am pleased to join you for the first of my post -FOMC press conferences.", "Like Chairman Bernanke before me, I appreciate the opportunity these press conferences afford to explain the decisions of the FOMC and respond to your questions.", "The Federal Open Market Committee  concluded a two- day meeting earlier today.", "As you already know from our s tatement, the Committee  decided to make another modest reduction in the pace of its purchases of longer -term securities.", "The Committee  also updated its guidance regarding the likely future path of the short -term interest rates.", "As I\u2019ll explain more fully  in a moment, this change in our guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee \u2019s policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements; rather, the change is meant to clarify how the Committee  anticipates policy evolving after the unemployment r ate declines below 6 \u00bd percent.", "Let me explain the economic outlook that underlies these actions.", "Despite some softer recent data, the FOMC\u2019s outlook for continued progress toward our goals of maximum employment and inflation returning to 2 percent remains  broadly unchanged.", "Unusually harsh weather in January and February has made assessing the underlying strength of the economy especially challenging.", "Broadly speaking, however, the spending and production data, while somewhat weaker than we had expected in January, are roughly in line with our expectations as of December, the last time Committee  participants submitted economic projections.", "In contrast, labor market conditions have continued to improve.", "The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, is three -tenths lower than the data available at the time of the December meeting.", "Further, broader measures of unemployment \u2014such as the U -6 measure, which includes marginally attached workers and those working part time but preferring full -time March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 2 of 23   work \u2014have fallen even  more than the headline unemployment rate over this period, and labor force participation has ticked up.", "While the Committee  continues to monitor developments in global financial markets carefully, financial conditions remain broadly consistent with the FOMC\u2019s objectives.", "In sum, the FOMC continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.", "Inflation has continued to run below the Committee \u2019s 2 percent objective.", "Given that longer -term inflation expectations appear to be well  anchored, and in light of the ongoing recovery in the United States and in many economies around the world, the FOMC continues to expect inflation to move gradually back toward its objective.", "The Committee  is mindful that inflation running persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic performance.", "The Committee  also recognizes, however, that policy actions tend to exert pressure on inflation that is manifest only gradually over time.", "The F OMC will continue assessing incoming data carefully to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC\u2019s longer -run objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.", "This outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submi tted in conjunction with this meeting by the 16 FOMC participants \u20144 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents.", "As always, each participant\u2019s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.", "The central tendency of the  unemployment rate projections has shifted down by about two- tenths since December and now stands at between 6.1 and 6.3 percent at the end of this year.", "The unemployment rate is projected to reach its longer -run normal level by the end of 2016.", "The cent ral tendency of the projections for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 to 3 percent for 2014 and remains somewhat above that of the estimates of longer -run normal growth through 2016.", "Meanwhile, as I noted, FOMC participants continue to see inflation March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 3 of 23   moving only gradually back toward 2 percent over time as the economy expands.", "The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.6 percent in 2014, rising to 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016.", "Let me now return to our decision to make another measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases.", "Starting next month, we will be purchasing $55 billion of securities per month, down $10 billion per month from our current rate.", "Even after today\u2019s action takes effect, we will continue to significantly expand our holdi ngs of longer -term securities, and we will also continue to roll over maturing Treasury securities and reinvest principal payments from the FOMC\u2019s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage -backed securities in agency mortgage -backed securities.", "These si zable and still- increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more accommodative, helping to support job creation and a return of inflation to the Committee \u2019s objective.", "The FOMC views today\u2019s decision to reduce the pace of asset purchases as consistent with the decisionmaking framework laid out last December and still in place today.", "As before, if incoming information broadly supports the Committee \u2019s expect ation of ongoing improvement in labor markets and inflation moving back over time toward its longer -run objective, the Committee  will likely continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases in measured steps at future meetings.", "However, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee \u2019s decisions about the pace of purchases remain contingent on its outlook for jobs and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.", "Today  the FOMC also updated its forward guidance regarding the path of short -term interest rates.", "As emphasized in the statement, the new guidance does not indicate any change in March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 4 of 23   the policy intentions of the FOMC but instead reflects changes in the conditions we face.", "In December 2012, the Committee  first stated its guidance in terms of economic thresholds , stipulating that the current low range for the federal funds rate target would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 \u00bd percent, inflation is projected to be no more than a half percentage point  above our longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored.", "Since that time, progress in the labor market has been more rapid than we had anticipated, while inflation has been lower than the Committee  had expected.", "Although the thresholds served well as a useful guide to policy over the past year, last December the FOMC judged it appropriate to update that guidance, noting that the current target range for the federal funds rate would likely be maintained \u201cwell past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6\u00bd percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee \u2019s 2 percent longer -run goal.\u201d  Today  the Committee  has fur ther revised its forward guidance to better reflect conditions as they now stand and are likely to evolve over coming quarters.", "The revised formulation starts with a general description of the factors that drive FOMC decisionmaking and then provides the FOMC\u2019s current assessment of what those factors will likely imply for the future path of short -term interest rates.", "In particular , the Committee  states that \u201c[ i]n determining how long to maintain the current 0 to \u00bc percent target range for the federal funds rate, it [the Committee] will assess progress\u2014both realized and expected \u2014toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\u201d   In short, the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from the respective objectives set by the FOMC, and the longer any such shortfall is expected to persist, the longer the target federal funds rate is likely to remain in the present 0 to \u00bc percent range.", "March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 5 of 23   The FOMC will base its ongoing assessment on a wide range of information , including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.", "As I\u2019ve noted, the FOMC\u2019s assessment  of these factors at present is consistent with the characterization provided in previous forward guidance.", "The Committee  continues to anticipate that conditions will likely warrant maintaining \u201cthe current range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends , especi ally if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee \u2019s 2 percent longer -run goal, and provided that longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored .\u201d The FOMC also supplemented its guidance pertaining to the period after the asset purchase program ends and the initial increase in the federal funds rate target has occurred.", "The statement continues to note that in deciding on the pace for removing accomm odation, the Committee  will take a balanced approach to attaining its objectives.", "The statement now adds the Committee \u2019s current anticipation that  \u201ceven after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some t ime, warrant keeping \u201d short -term interest rates \u201c below levels the Committee  views as normal in the longer run.\u201d  This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants\u2019 projections, which show the federal funds ra te for most participants remaining well below longer -run normal values at the end of 2016.", "Although FOMC participants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate target remaining below its longer -run normal level, many cite the residual impacts of the financial crisis, and some note that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower, at least for a time.", "March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 6 of 23   In summary, the Committee \u2019s actions today reflect its assessment that progress in the labor market is continuing, but that much re mains to be done on both the jobs and inflation fronts.", "Unemployment is still elevated, underemployment and long -term unemployment remain significant concerns, and inflation is running significantly below the FOMC\u2019s objective.", "These conditions warrant the continuation of highly accommodative policy reflected in today\u2019s policy statement.", "The Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate guidance and its substantial and still -increasing holdings of longer -term securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, promoting the FOMC\u2019s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.", "Well, as I mentioned in my statement, the reason the Committee  felt that the time ha d come to revise the forward guidance is not because we think it has not been effective.", "I believe the Committee  does think it \u2019s been effective.", "I think it \u2019s had a very useful impact in helping markets understand our expectations and  shaping their own.", "But it is becoming \u2014as the unemployment rate gets closer and closer to 6\u00bd percent , to breaching that threshold tha t seems like the one that is likely to be breached .", "The question is :  Markets want to know, the public wants to understand, beyond that threshold, how will we decide what to do?", "March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 7 of 23   So the purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the past, even though it is qualitative information , about what we will be looking at as the unemployment rate declines below 6\u00bd percent in deciding how long to hold the federal funds rate at this 0 to \u00bc percent range.", "How large are the shortfalls in achieving our goals ?", "We initially started  with an unemployment rate as a threshold.", "That was easy enough for the Committee  to say , \u201cWith an unemployment rate above 6\u00bd percent, we know we\u2019re not close to full employment, not close to an employment level consistent with our mandate, and unless inflation were a significant concern, we wo uldn\u2019 t dream of raising the federal funds rate target.", "\u201d  Now, the Committee  has never felt that the unemployment rate is a sufficient statistic for the labor market.", "I think if I had to choose one indicator of the labor market, the unemployment rate is probably as good a  one as I could find.", "But in assessing the real st ate of slack in the labor market  and ultimately of in flationary pressures that might\u2014or deflationary pressur es that could result from that\u2014it\u2019 s appropriate to look at many more things.", "And that \u2019s why the Committee  now states we will look at a broad range of info rmation.", "President Kocherlakota felt \u2014I believe he noted in his dissent  that he endorses the new guidance about the likely path of the fed eral funds rate after we begin to finally raise it.", "And that indicates that it\u2019 s unlikely to be back to normal levels for some  time , but he questions whether or not the  reformulated forward guidance shows March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 8 of 23   sufficient commitment of the Committee  to its 2 pe rcent inflation objective.", "And I will simply say on my own behalf , and on behalf of the Committee , that we are fully committed to the 2 percent inflation objective , and we do not want to undershoot inflation for a prolonged period of time.", "As I mentioned, monetary policy operates with lags , so, the policies we have in place, we think, will gradually \u2014only gradually \u2014move inflation back to 2 percent .", "But if the Committee  had real concerns that inflation were going to remain persistently below 2 percent, I feel confident that the Committee  would act to prevent that.", "You know, the Committee \u2014I think the Committee , in assessing the economy \u2014if you compare today \u2019s assessment with December \u2019s, is virtually identical.", "A lmost nothing has changed in the overall Committee  assessment of the outlook.", "A s I mentioned, unemployment has come down.", "The labor market more broadly , I think, has  improved a little more tha n we might have expected , and that  slightly more rapid improvement in the unem ployment picture might explain \u2014I can \u2019t speak for why  people write down what they do, but \u2014a little bit of the upward shift in those dots.", "March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 9 of 23   But, more generally, I think that one should not look to the dot plot , so to speak, as the primary way in which the Committee  wants to or is speaking about policy to the public at large.", "The FOMC statement is  the device that the Committee  as a policy making group uses to express its opinions, a nd we have expressed a number of opinions about the likely path of rates .", "In particular, the Committee  has endorse d the view that it anticipates it will be a considerable period after the asset purchase program ends before it will be appropriate to begin to raise rates.", "Looking further out, let \u2019s say if you look toward the end of 2016 when most participants are projecting that the employmen t situation \u2014that the unemployment rate will be close to their notions of mandate -consistent or  longer -run normal levels.", "What you see, I think, if you look this time \u2014if you gaze at the picture from December or September , which is the first year that we showed those dot plots for the end of 2016, is the massiv e points that are notably below w hat the partici pants believe is the normal longer -run level for nominal short -term rates, and the Committee  today , for the first time , endorsed that as a Committee  view.", "More generally, you know, the end of 2016 is a long way out.", "M onetary policy will be geared to evolving conditions in the economy , and the public does need to understand that as those views evolve, the Committee \u2019s views on policy will likely evolve with them.", "A nd that \u2019s a kind of uncertainty that the Committee  wouldn\u2019 t want to eliminate completely from its guidance March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 10 of 23   because we want the policy we put in place to be appropriate to the economic conditions that will prevail years down the road.", "Yes, I think it does suggest a shallower glide path, and what the Committee  is expressing here, I would say , is its forecast of what will be appropriate some years from now ba sed on its \u2014the understanding that we \u2019ve developed about what are the economic forces that have been driving economic activity.", "We\u2019ve had a series of years now in which growth has  proven disappointing.", "N ow, members of the Committee  have different views about why this is likely to be true , that the funds rate\u2014when the labor market is normalized and inflation is back to our objective \u2014they maybe have slightly different views on exactly why it \u2019s likely to be the case that interest rates  will be a little lower than they would in the longer run.", "But for many, it\u2019 s a matter of headwinds from the crisis that have taken a very long time to dissipate and are likely to continue being operative.", "So, some examples I would say is, we have under \u2014many households are undergoing balance sheet repair.", "There are many underwater mortgage holders , difficulties therefore in gaining access to March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 11 of 23   credit \u2014for example, through home equity lines of credit .", "Mortgage credit is very difficult for those still to get without pristine credit scores .", "For some , fiscal policy is somewhat tighter than would be expected over the  next several years.", "For some , it\u2019s headwinds from the global economy play a role as well.", "But the general assessment is that even after we\u2019ve had an accommodative monetary policy for long enough to get the economy back on track in the sense of meeting our objectives, the stance of policy that will be appropriate to accomplish that will be easier or involve somewhat lower than would be normal short -term interest rates.", "But, as you sa id, that suggests the path will be gradual.", "But I do want to emphasize , this is a forecast , and this is the Committee \u2019s forecast based on its understanding of the economy at this time .", "And as we watch the economy over the next several years , that could e volve.", "So , I\u2019d say , certainly  the analysis that we\u2019 ve done \u2014and we did spend a lot of time discussing weather  and how it \u2019s affected businesses and households in various parts of the country \u2014certainly weather has played an important role in weakening economic activity March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 12 of 23   in Q1.", "It\u2019s not the only factor that is at work, and most proje ctions for growth in the first quarter are reasonably weak .", "But I would say it \u2019s likely in the view of most of the Committee  to begin to wash out in the second quarter , and we can even see some rebound .", "So, you know, let me just say between December and January , the Committee  saw data that le d it to be quite a bit more optimistic  about the economic outlook.", "So , in some sense , our views have moved around here a little bit, but if we take December to March , the Committee \u2019s views are largely unchanged.", "I feel I \u2019m very lucky that I \u2019ve had a lot  of Fed experience to draw on  as I approach this role because it \u2019s complicated , and  now in many ways I feel the buck stops with me in terms of management of the FOMC and responsibility to assure that the Federal Reserve makes progress on its goals of getting the economy back on track and  making progress on our financial stability and regulation objectives .", "So I feel that weight of responsibility keenly in the new role I have, and I \u2019m very committed to making sure that I provide the leadership that \u2019s necess ary for the Federal Reserve S ystem  to move forward on these goals.", "But, you know, in terms of the conduct of business, it \u2019s pretty much the same as usual.", "March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 13 of 23   I\u2019m not envisioning , nor have there been so far , any radical changes in how the Federal Reserve does its business, and that includes operating the FO", "So, I\u2019d say so far we haven \u2019t had that tradeoff to make because inflation is r unning well below our objective, a nd by any measure there remains substantial slack in the labor market.", "So  tradeoffs and worrying about doing more or less because we have conflicting objectives, this really has not been an element in our discussions about how to be conducting policy now.", "As we get closer to meeting our goals , it could become an element, a nd I would say that we \u2019ve given guidance in the statement \u2014and we gave perhaps more guidance in our so- called consensus  statement or statement of longer -run goals and mon etary policy strategies that we \u2019ve now reaffirmed for three years in a row \u2014that the Committee  would take a balanced approach in situations where our objectives conflict and we \u2019re faced with tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment.", "When we first put our thresholds into effect, we envisioned a possible situation where such a tradeoff could arise, where we might fa ce a situation where unemployment was quite high\u2014namely , over 6\u00bd percent \u2014and inflation might be drifting close to 2  or even a little bit above 2.", "And our threshold- based guidance gave some more concrete indication that we would tolerate inflation running a little bit over 2 percent with unemployment sufficiently high before moving the federal funds rate off zero.", "And to the extent that that concrete guidance is usef ul, March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 14 of 23   the\u2014I don \u2019t believe that \u2019s a situation that we \u2019re likely \u2014if I thought that that was a situation we were likely to encounter in the next several years, we probably would have revised our forward guidance in a different way.", "But I would point you to the statement \u2014the final statement in th is statement that says that the FOMC does not see this guidance as indicating any change in our policy i ntentions , and I would include how we would make tradeoffs between our inflation and employment objectives if we were to face that situation.", "I simply meant to say that if we continued to reduce the pace  of our asset purchases in the manner that we have, in measured steps , that the program would be winding down next fall.", "So, I \u2014you know, this is the kind of term \u2014it\u2019 s hard to define.", "We need to see where the labor market is, how close are we to our full employment goal \u2014that will be a March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 15 of 23   complicated assessment not just base d on a single statistic \u2014and how rapidly are we moving toward it ?", "And then, what the statement emphasizes , and this is the same language we used in December and January,  we used the language especially if inflation is running below our 2 percent objective.", "Inflation matters here , too, and our general principle tries to capture that notion.", "If we have a substantial shortfall in inflation, if inflation is persistently running below our 2 percent objective , that is a very good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for longer.", "So I think the numbers you cited would be extremes in terms of defining what we \u2019d need to see.", "I guess the way I would put it is this :  There are two conditions for the Committee  to decide to continue tapering the pace of purchases.", "The first is that we need to assess that the labor market continues to be on the mend and that we feel reasonably satisfied that the outlook is for further improvement in  the labor market that will get us back to our maximum employment objective.", "And , second of all, we March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 16 of 23   need to see\u2014 and now coming back to inflation again\u2014inflation is low , and it \u2019s been running well below our objective.", "And we need to see evidence that leaves us feeling satisfied that inflation will move up over time, that we believe the evidence is consistent with its moving up over time .", "If the Committee  no longer feels comfortable making such assessments \u2014so, if there is enough change in the data we \u2019re seeing about the economy that it no longer seems reasonable or convincing to make those  two separate assessments, then a case has been made to change the pace of asset purchases and to deviate from the current plan.", "So 5 percent  and 1 percent, those are very extreme numbers.", "But I would want to feel confident in making those two statements about the labor market and inflation.", "With respect to the issue of short -term unemployment and its being more relevant for inflation and a  better measure of the labor market, I \u2019ve seen res earch along those lines.", "I think it would be tremendously premature to adopt any notion that says that that is an accurate read on either how inflation is determined or what constitutes slack in the labor market.", "So I think this is something our Committe e will be looking at, especially as unemployment goes down and other labor market indicators hopefully simultaneously improve.", "We \u2019re looking to see progress on many different dimensions where we see slack in the economy, but I wouldn\u2019 t endorse, and I certainly don\u2019 t think our Committee  would endorse, the judgment of the research that you cited.", "So I have talked in the past about indicators I like to watch or I think that are relevant in assessing the labor market.", "In addition to the standard unemployment rate, I certainly look at broader  measures of unemployment.", "It\u20145 percent of the labor force working part time on an involuntary basis, that \u2019s an exceptionally high number relative to the measured unemployment rate, and it\u2014so, to my mind, is a form of slack that is \u2014adds to what we see in the normal unemployment rate and is unusually large.", "Of course, I watch discouraged and marginally attached workers.", "The share of long -term unemployment has been immensely high and can be very stubborn in bringing down, that\u2019s something t hat I watch closely .", "Again, that remains exceptionally high, but it has come down from something like 45 percent  to high 30s, but that \u2019s certainly on my dashboard.", "Labor force participation\u2014 I do think most research suggests that due to demographic factor s, labor force participation will be coming down, and there has been a downward trend now for a number of years.", "But I think there is also a cyclical component in the fact that labor force participation is depressed.", "And so, it may be that as the economy  begins to strengthen, we could see labor force participation flatten out for a time as discouraged workers start moving back into the labor market.", "In the Committee , we\u2019ll have to watch \u2014there are different views on this within the Committee , and it \u2019s hard to know definitively what part of labor force participation is structural versus cyclical , so it\u2019s something to watch closely.", "I\u2019ve also mentioned, in the past , measures of labor market  turnover.", "A remarkably large share of workers quit their March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 18 of 23   jobs every month, usually going directly into another job.", "And I take the quit rate in many ways as a sign of the health of the economy.", "When workers are scared they won\u2019 t be able to get other jobs, they show a reduced willingness to quit their jobs.", "Now, quit rates now are below normal pre-recession levels, but on the other hand, they have come up over time , and so we have seen improvement.", "The job opening rate has also come up.", "The hires rate, however, remains extremely depressed , and I take that as a sign of a weaker labor market.", "The final thing I \u2019d mention is wages , and wage growth has really been very low.", "I know there is perhaps one isolated measure of wage growth that suggests some uptick, but most measures of w age increase are running at very low levels.", "In fact, with the productivity growth we have and 2 percent inflation, one would probably expect to see , on an ongoing basis , something between\u2014perhaps 3 and 4 percent wage inflation would be normal.", "Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent.", "So not only is it depressed, signaling weakness in the labor market, but it is certainly not flashing .", "An increase in  it might signal some tightening or meaningful pressures on inflation, at least over time.", "Well, I think the short answer is that we have lived through a devastating financial crisis that has taken an exceptional toll on the economy in many different ways, from housing to leaving a huge number of homeowners  with mortgages living in homes with mortgages that are underwater , has had a highly negative effect on their credit ratings  and March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 19 of 23   their ability to access credit, has left businesses with very cautious attitudes that we see in busines s investment spending that is very restrained.", "On top of that, we \u2019ve had weakness in the global economy , and we \u2019ve had a very tight fiscal policy at home .", "After stimulus a t the onset of the recession, we \u2019ve had a good deal of fiscal consolidation in the United States and, at a time when fiscal policy normally in the past would have been serving to create jobs, fiscal policy from that standpoint has served as a headwind to the recovery.", "And at the federal \u2014especially at the federal level , but also with sta te and local levels as well.", "And monetary policy has tried to do what we can to offset that.", "I think it \u2019s probably true that monetary policy may have played a role  in touching off that market reaction, but I think the market reaction was exacerbated by the fact that we had a very significant unwinding of carry trades  and other leveraged positions that investors had taken, perhaps thinking that the level of volatilit y was exceptionally low and perhaps lower than was safe for them to have assumed.", "But we certainly saw \u2014now, in some ways, the fact that term premia in interest rates have come up somewhat, although it has had a negative effect on the recovery and that \u2019s evident in housing \u2014in the slowdown in housing \u2014perhaps it \u2019s diminished some financial instability risk that may have been associated with these carry trades and speculative activities that were unwinding during that time.", "A lesson is that we will try, and w e March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   Page 20 of 23   were trying then, but we will continue to try to communicate as clearly as we possibly can about how we will conduct monetary policy and to be as steady and determined and as transparent as we can to provide as much clarity as is reasonably certain \u2014given  that the economic developments in the economy are themselves uncertain \u2014but we will try as hard as we can not to be a source of instability here.", "Well, I think the level of interest rates remains low by historic levels.", "And the level of household formation is very depressed, has been very depressed for some time.", "There \u2019s a lot of demographic potential there for new household formation that would ultimately gene rate new construction, either sing
