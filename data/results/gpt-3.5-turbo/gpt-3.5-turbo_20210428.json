different housing market than it was before the Global F inancial C risis.", "And one of the main differences was that households were in very good April 28, 2021 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference

houses.", "There \u2019s no q uestion, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we \u2019re watching that carefully.", "It\u2019s, it\u2019s partly because there\u2019 s, there\u2019s  clearly strong demand, and there \u2019s just not a lot of supply right now.", "So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up wi th the demand, clearly.", "A nd if you\u2019 re\u2014if you\u2019re an entry

part of a strong economy, with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing.", "It \u2019s clearly the strongest housing market that we \u2019ve seen since the G lobal Financial C

know, it is \u2014it\u2019s  not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and we\u2019re watching it very carefully.", "I don \u2019t see the kind of financial stability current concerns,

many companies are reporting labor shortages.", "We don\u2019 t see wages moving up yet, and presumably we would see April 28, 2021 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 12 of 29   that in a real \u2014you know, in a really tight labor market.", "I do think\u2014so what will happen\u2014what we saw during the last expansion, an d it may  be a different expansion, we don\u2019 t know, but , but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up.", "In other words, if you were worried about there \u2014about running out of workers, it seemed like we never did.", "You know, labor force participati on held up.", "People came in the labor force.", "They stayed in the labor force longer than expected.", "So my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force, and these jobs will be \u2014the labor market will reach equilibrium.", "B ut I do think that \u2014and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that \u2019s a factor, which is not clear , it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.", "So my guess is, it will come back to this e conomy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand.", "S o I actually have a couple things I \u2019d like to say about inflation, including addressing your question.", "So let me start with just saying that we\u2019re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.", "Our , our price stability goal is 2  percent  inflation over the longer run, and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent  over time will help anchor long- term inflation expectations at 2 percent .", "With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent  for some time , the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times \u2014above 2 percent  for some time.", "So, with a , a little bit of context, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  making our way through an unprecedented series of events, really, in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to widespread reopening of economies  in many places around the world.", "In the United States, fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support :  Vaccinations are now widespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum.", "During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I \u2019ll discuss why.", "But those pres sures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process.", "In an episode of one -time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as, and is not likely to lead to , persistently higher year -over-year inflation into the future \u2014inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2  percent  inflation over time.", "Indeed, it is the Fed \u2019s job to make sure that that does not happen.", "If, if , contrary to expectations, inflation were to move persistently and materially  above 2  percent  in a manner that threatened to move longer -term inflation expectations materially above 2  percent , we would use our tools to bring April 28, 2021 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 14 of 29   inflation and expectations down to mandate -consistent levels.", "And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent  inflation over time.", "So let me talk quickly about the two reasons \u2014two , or you could say three, but really two main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term.", "Th e first is the base effect s.  Twelve -month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent  over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation.", "You saw it in the March CPI reading, and you\u2019 ll see it later this week in the PCE price data.", "These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.", "They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods.", "The other big one I would talk about is bottleneck s.  So this is what we \u2019re seeing in supply chains in various industries, and we \u2019re, we\u2019re  in close touch with all of these industries.", "You know, the Fed  has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits for that matter,  too.", "A bottleneck really is a temporary blockage or restriction in the supply chain for , for a particular good or goods, something that slows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market.", "We think of bottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt , and we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they\u2019 re temporary and April 28, 2021 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 15 of 29   expected to resolve themselves.", "It\u2019s much harder to predict with confidence the amount of time it will take to resolve the bottlenecks, or for that matter, the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the meantime.", "So, you know, I \u2019ll just sum up and say, we understand our job.", "We will do our job.", "A nd we are, we are focused \u2014as you\u2019 ve seen, for many years, we \u2019ve been focused on inflation deviating below 2 percent , and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent .", "If, if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent  in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent .", "It \u2019s not one really good employment reading, which is w hat we got in March.", "We got close to a million jobs in March and a very strong labor market reading.", "We\u2019re 8\u00bd  million jobs below where we were in February  of 2020, and that doesn\u2019 t account for growth in the labor force and growth in the economy, that trend we were on.", "So we have \u2014we \u2019re a long way from our , our goals .", "And we don\u2019 t have to get all the way to our goals to taper asset purchases, w e just need to make substantial further progress.", "I was really thinking \u2014we were thinking of the base effects and also the energy effects.", "I mean, there are alway s\u2014there are always relative prices going up and down within inflation.", "You know, there \u2019s a basket for CPI or P", "We\u2019re, we, we  supervise banks to make sure that they have risk -management systems in place so that they can spot these things.", "We don\u2019 t manage their companies for them or , or try to manage individual risks.", "In the gra nd scheme of these large April 28, 2021 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 17 of 29   institutions, the Archegos risks were not systemically important or were not of the size that they would have really created trouble for any of those institutions.", "What was troubling, though, was that this could happen in a business for a number of firms that is thought to be \u2014to carry relatively well understood risks.", "The prime brokerage business is, is  a well understood business, and so it was surprising that a num ber of them would have had this .", "And it was essentially , I believe , the fact that, that  they had the same big risk position on  with a number of firms, and they weren\u2019 t\u2014some of the firms were not aware that there were other firms that had those things.", "It, it\u2014i n some cases, it may be they were \u2014it seems as though there were risk -management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them.", "But I will\u2014 I will go visit when, when it\u2019 s no longer a , a news story .", "I mean, they\u2019 re, they\u2019re \u2014these are people who, in many cases, had jobs and, you know, they have lives, and they\u2019 ve just , they\u2019ve just  found themselves in this place.", "So I t hink the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to understand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well.", "Central bank digital currencies are now possible, and we\u2019 re going to see some of them around the world.", "And there are some very, very difficult questions to answer, but I think we \u2014and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the technology and the policy issues.", "April 28, 2021 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 19 of 29   I am\u2014I would say this :  We\u2019re the world \u2019s reserve currency, and that means that the dollar is used in transactions all around the world, far more than any other currency.", "And that \u2019s because of our rule

global competition.", "Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit \u2014and here we think of survey, market  based \u2014survey being eith er households or , or economists and , and  market based.", "You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what would have been consistent with a 2 percent  inflation target, particularly our 2  percent  inflation target, which calls f or 2 percent  average inflation.", "Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they\u2019 ve just moved back up to levels broadly\u2014
