["At our meeting that concluded earlier today, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1 \u00bc percent.", "This accommodative policy should support some further strengthening in the job market and a return to 2 percent inflation, consistent with our statutory o bjectives.", "We also decided that in October we will begin the balance sheet normalization program that we outlined in June.", "This program will reduce our securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner.", "I\u2019ll have more to say about these decisions shortly, but first I\u2019ll review recent economic developments and the outlook.", "As we expected, and smoothing through some variation from quarter to quarter, economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year.", "Household spending has been supported by ongoing strength in the job market.", "Business investment has picked up, and exports have shown greater strength this year, in part reflecting improved economic conditions abroad.", "Overall, we expect that the economy will continue to expand at a moderat e pace over the next few years.", "In the third quarter, however, economic growth will be held down by the severe disruptions caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.", "As activity resumes and rebuilding gets under  way, growth likely will bounce back.", "Ba sed on past experience, these effects are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy beyond the next couple of quarters.", "Of course, for the families and communities that have been devastated by the storms, recovery will take time, and  on behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sympathy for all those who have suffered losses.", "September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 2 of 25  In the labor market, job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the three months ending in August \u2014a solid rate of growth that remained well above estimate s of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force.", "We know from some timely indicators , such as initial claims for unemployment insurance , that the hurricanes severely disrupted the labor market in the affected areas, and payroll employmen t may be substantially affected in September.", "Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has stayed low in recent months and, at 4.4 percent in August, was modestly below the median of FOMC participants\u2019 estimates of its longer -run normal level.", "Participation in the labor force has changed little, both recently and over the past four years.", "Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relative ly steady participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market.", "W e expect that the job market will strengthen somewhat further.", "Turning to inflation, the 12- month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.4 percent in July, down noticeably from earlier in the year.", "Core inflation\u2014which excludes the volatile food and energy categories \u2014has also moved lower.", "For quite some time, inflation has been running below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer -run obje ctive.", "However, we believe this year\u2019s shortfall in inflation primarily reflects developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions.", "For example, one -off reductions earlier this year in certain categories of prices, such as wireless t elephone services, are currently holding down inflation, but these effects should be transitory.", "Such developments are not uncommon and, as long as inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, are not of great concern from a policy perspective because their effects fade away.", "September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 3 of 25  Similarly, the recent hurricane -related increases in gasoline prices will likely boost inflation, but only temporarily.", "More broadly, with employment near assessments of its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee continues to expect inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer -run objective.", "Nonetheless, our understanding of the forces driving inflation is imperf ect, and in light of the unexpected lower inflation readings this year, the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.", "As always, the Committee is prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve its inflation and employment objectives  over the medium term.", "Let me turn to the economic projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, which now extend through 2020.", "As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate moneta ry policy , which, in turn, depend on each participant\u2019s assessment s of the many factors that shape the outlook.", "The median projection for growth of inflation -adjusted gross domestic product , or real GDP , is 2.4 percent this year and about 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.", "By 2020, the median growth projection moderates to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated longer -run rate.", "The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs a little above 4 per cent over the next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.", "Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020.", "Compared with the projections made  in June, real GDP growth is a touch stronger this year , and inflation\u2014particularly core inflation \u2014is slightly softer this year and next.", "September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 4 of 25  Returning to monetary policy, although the Committee decided at this meeting to maintain its target for the federal funds rate, we continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer -run objective.", "That expectation is based on our view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level \u2014that is, the level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel.", "Because the neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a neutral policy stance.", "But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.", "Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer -run neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain  below levels that prevailed in previous decades.", "This view is consistent with participants\u2019 projections of appropriate monetary policy.", "The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of nex t year, 2.7 percent at the end of 2019, and 2.9 percent in 2020.", "Compared with the projections made in June, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged, although the median estimate of the longer -run normal value edged down to 2.8 percent.", "As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks.", "Policy is not on a preset  course.", "As I noted, the Committee announced today that it will begin its balance sheet normalization program in October.", "This program, which was described in the June addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, will gradually decrease our reinvestments of September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 5 of 25  proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency securities.", "As a result, our balance sheet will decline gradually and predictably.", "For October through December, the decline in our securities holdings will be capped at $6 billion per month for Treasuries and $4 billion per month for agencies.", "These caps will gradually rise over the course of the following year to maximums of $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency securities and will remain in place through the process of normalizing the size of our balance sheet.", "By limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings, the caps should guard against outs ized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains.", "Finally, as we have noted previously, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.", "Our balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times.", "We therefore do not plan on making adjustments to our balance sheet normalization program.", "But, of course, as we stated in June, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a materi al deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate.", "So let me first say that employment is a very important part of our mandate.", "We \u2019re charged by Congress with trying to pursue maximum employment, and we have taken that very seriously.", "I\u2019m very pleased and heartened by the i mprovement we have seen in the labor market, and  at 4.4 percent, t he unemployment rate has  really fallen to quite a low level.", "As that \u2019s happened, the unemployment rates for less advantaged groups in the labor m arket , particularly African  Americans and Hispanics, ha s fallen more dramatically than that for the nation as a whole, reversing the outsized increases that those groups experienced when the financial crisis and G reat R ecession hit.", "A nd these are really very positive development s.  So we certainly seek a strong labor m arket, but we have a dual mandate, which is inflation and unemployment , and we also have to be mindful of our obligation to achieve a  2 percent inflation objective over the medium term.", "Now, I recognize and it \u2019s important that inflation has been running under our 2 percent objective for a number of years , and that is a concern, particularly if it were to translate into lower inflation expectations.", "For a number of years there were very understandable reasons for that shortfall, and they included quite a lot of slack in the labor m arket \u2014which , my judgment would be , has largely disappeared \u2014very large reductions in energy prices , and a large appreciation of the dollar that lowered import prices starting in mid -2014.", "This year, the September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 7 of 25  shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, when none of those factors is operative , is more of a mystery, and I will not say that the C ommittee clearly understands what the causes are of that.", "Now, we do , in our regular projection, show fan charts indicating the typical size of forecast errors .", "All of the variables \u2014GDP, t he unemploymen t rate , and inflation \u2014are forecast by ourselves and private forecasters with errors , and so there is variation in these economic variables fro m year to year.", "I would say our  judgment , as I said in the statement, is that the shortfall is not largely relate d to cyclical considerations.", "You can see from the projections that the C ommittee participants submitted that we anticipate that core and headline inflation will move up close to our 2 percent objective next year \u2014namely , that the shortfall this year is du e to transitory factors that are likely to disappear over the course of the coming year .", "But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent .", "And as we watch incoming data, the assessments that you see participants wr ite down about the path of the federal funds r ate, they are not set in stone .", "We will look at incoming data on inflation and on other economic variables, including the labor m arket , in deciding what we should actually do going f orward .", "And if it proves contrary to our expectations that the shortfall is persistent, it will be necessary to adjust monetary policy to address that.", "But I want to point out that while there are risks that inflation could continue below 2 percent, whic h we need to take account of in monetary policy , monetary policy also operates with a  lag.", "And experience suggests that tightness in the labor  market , gradually and with a  lag, tends to push up wage and price inflation, and that \u2019s also a risk , that we want to be careful not to allow the economy to overheat in a way that would force us later on, somewhere do wn the road, to have to tighten m onetary policy rapidly , which could cause a recession a nd threaten the very desirable labor m arket conditio ns that we have now.", "So at  every  meeting  we try to assess the economic o utlook and take account of information that \u2019s been accumulated about the real economy and also developments in financial markets and put all of that together in assessing the course of the economy.", "So developments affecting asset prices and longer -term interest rates, the exchange rate\u2014all of those aspects of financial conditions factor into our thinking .", "But it\u2019 s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall outlook.", "Sometimes mo vements \u2014upward movements in asset prices can,  for example, reflect a change in market participants \u2019\u2014reduction in market participants \u2019 estimates of the longer -run level of interest rates.", "So there has been \u2014there have been downward revisions both to the Committee \u2019s and to market participants \u2019 estimates of the longer -run normal level of interest rates , which in turn reflects in some sense a  view that , going out many years , aggregate demand globally is likely to be weakened by continuing low productivity growt h and aging populations .", "And, of course , we don\u2019 t know if that view is correct, but that \u2019s a factor that could be reflected \u2014could be one reason why asset prices have moved as they have.", "So , you know, why are asset prices moving ?", "That\u2019s important in dete rmining the impact on the overall outlook, but , certainly , we are taking account of movements in asset prices in evaluating the appropriate stance of policy.", "So we have two policy tools that are available to us to use:  the balance sheet and adjustments in  short -term interest rates \u2014our  federal funds rate target .", "And, historically , the C ommittee has  operated t o adjust monetary conditions to meet our economic goals when there are shocks to the economy by adjusting  the federal funds r ate\u2014our  short -term interest rate target.", "And that \u2019s something \u2014a technique of monetary control that we  have  used for a very long time that we are familiar with, we believe we understa nd pretty well what  the effects are on the economy, market participants understand how that tool has been used and would likely be adjusted in response to shocks to the economy .", "And our preference is , when we have two different tools that we could use to actively adjust the stance of policy, to  prefer and to make a commitment that, to t he maximum extent possible , the federal funds r ate will be the September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 10 of 25  active tool of policy.", "That is what we intend to use unless we think that the threat to the economy is sufficiently great that we might have to cut the federal funds rate\u2014after all , we\u2019ve moved it up to 1 to 1\u00bc percent  and expect it to go up further \u2014but a very significant negativ e shock to the economy could conceivably force us bac k to the so- called zero lower bound.", "We have said if there were that type of  material deterioration in the o utlook where we cou ld face a situation where the federal funds r ate isn \u2019t a su fficient tool fo r us to adjust monetary p olicy, we might stop\u2014we might stop r oll-offs from our balance sheet and resume reinvestment .", "But as long as we believe that we can use the federal funds rate as a tool , that is what we intend to do.", "So, if there are small changes in the outlook t hat require a recalibration of monetary policy, we will change our anticipated path and setting of the federal funds rate, but not , for example, change the caps on reinvestment or stop \u2014continue  reinvestment for a few months and then change it.", "We think that provides greater clarity to market participants about how policy will be conducted and will be , will be  less confusing and more eff ective in terms of conducting policy.", "We believe that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in  our federal funds rate target, but if conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be \u2014it mig ht be that growth is more rapid, t he labor m arket tightens more quickly than we assume, an d inflation appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected \u2014we have not promised, no matter what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual.", "We believe that that will be appropriate , but we  always watching the economy and  will adjust policy as appropriate.", "Now, as I said, the hurdle to changing our plans with respect to the balance sheet , in some sense , is high.", "If conditions were to weaken, we  would really only consider resuming reinvestment if it were what we refer to as a material deterioration , and I tried to explain why that is .", "But, you know, we will adjust monetary policy .", "And we think it\u2019s helpful to show the public some sense that it helps in understanding our evaluation of the economy .", "W hat\u2019s not subject to change is our commitmen t to doing everything in our power to achieve the goals that Congress has  assigned to u s, which are price stability or 2 percent inflation and maximum employment.", "So , certainly , if growth is stronger or if inflation picks up more rapidly , we have room.", "We have a certain amount of room now , and we have raised the funds September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 12 of 25  rate four times.", "So the reason for our actions today in beginning to run down the balance sheet is, we think the economy is performing well and we have confidence in the outlook for the real economy .", "But, of course , there are shocks , and if the negative shock to the economy were sufficient, we recognize that we might be unable to pursue objective s purely by cutting the federal funds r ate, and that is why we say explicitly that we would be prepared , in that event, to resume reinvestment , and other tools that we used in the financial crisis \u2014forward guidance \u2014would also be available to us.", "So the term \u201c trend inflation \u201d\u2014usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.", "Exactly what that means is, in some sense , a statistical thing, and there are methodologies that would show some modest decline in recent year s in the trend.", "After all, we\u2019ve had a numbe r of years in which inflation has  been low.", "As I said in answer to an earlier question, I think if you g o back to, s ay, 2013 and consider the \u2014until this year, the reasons why inflation was low are not hard to understand.", "It\u2019s a combination September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 13 of 25  of slack in the labor m arket, declines in energ y prices, and a strong dollar that pulled down import price inflation.", "So what \u2019s important in determining inflation going forward is inflation expectations.", "By some \u2014by many\u2014by some survey measures of professional forecasters, those have been rock solid.", "We do also look at household expectations, which have come down some.", "Market -based measures of inflation c ompensation, as we mentioned in the statement \u2014they have declined, and they\u2019ve been stable in recent months, but they \u2019ve declined to levels that are low by historical standards.", "That might suggest that inflation expectations have come down, but one can\u2019 t get a clear read \u2014the re are risk premia built into inflation c ompensation that make it impossible to extract directly what inflation expectations are.", "I can \u2019t say I can easily poin t to a sufficient set of factors that explain this year why inflation has been this  low.", "I\u2019ve mentioned a few idiosyncratic things, but , frankly, the low inflation is more broad based than just idiosyncratic things.", "The fact that inflation is unusually l ow this year does not mean that that \u2019s going to continue.", "Remember that in January and February, core inflation was running over a 12- month basis at around 1.9 percent, and we look to be very close to 2 now.", "We \u2019ve had several months of data that have meaningfully pulled that down, and what we need to do is  figure out whether or not the factors that have lowered inflation are likely to prove persistent or they \u2019re likely to prove transitory, and that\u2019s what we \u2019re going to try to be determining on the basis of incoming data .", "And you asked me about the policy implications.", "Of course, if we determined our view changed, and instead of thinking that the factors holding inflation down were transitory , we came to the view that they would be persistent, it would re quire an alteration in monetary policy to move inflation back up to 2 percent, and we would be committed to making that adjustment.", "So I \u2019m not really going to try to explain what market participants are thinking.", "I thin k all of us \u2014both market and FOM C participant s\u2019 paths have come down.", "N ot in the last couple of quart ers, but over the last several years , there\u2019 s been a growing recognition that the so -called neutral interest rate, consistent with the economy operating at maximum employment, that that rate seems to have come down, and most of the economic papers and  research bearing on this topic suggest that it \u2019s quite low.", "Market \u2014SEP \u2014the FOMC participants \u2014you can see by their estimates of the longer -run normal rate of interest, it is \u2014this time it came down from\u2014the median came down from  3 percent to 2.75 percent.", "So that shows that even in the long run, FOM C participants, in light of incoming data, are adjusting their views.", "I would say they still believe that,  in real terms, that neutral rate will be rising somewhat over the next few years .", "With a 2 percent inflati on rate , that long-run estimate in real terms amounts to 75 basis points, which is higher than the zero or slightly positive rates now.", "So I have said that I intend to serve out my term as C hair, and that I\u2019m really not going to comment on my intentions beyond that.", "I will say that I have not had a further meeting with President Trump.", "I met with him early in my term, and I \u2019ve not had a  further meeting with him.1 ADAM SHAPI", "So you asked me , what was the main \u2014first , what was the main message of my speech, and I would say it \u2019s that we put in place, since the financial crisis, a set of core reforms that have strengthened the financial system, and , in my personal view, it \u2019s impor tant they remain in place .", "And those core reforms are more capital, higher -quality capital, more liquidity \u2014especially in systemically important banking institutions \u2014stress testing, and resolution plans .", "And those four prongs of improvements in banking supervision have really strengthened the financial system and made it more resilient, and I believe they should stay in place.", "But I also tried to emphasize \u2014and I believe that they have contributed to growth and the availability of credit.", "I would point out particularly community banks that are laboring under significant regulatory burden.", "W e have been looking for ways to scale back burdens, running the EGRPRA  process , where we \u2019ve listened to concerns among community banks and are looking September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 17 of 25  for ways, for example , to simplify capital standards and reduce burdens, and that \u2019s very important.", "More generally, we want to tailor \u2014we want to , and  we would like to see Congress as well\u2014we can do things to appropriately tailor regulati ons to the risk posed by different kinds of banking organizations.", "And then  some of the regulations that we have put in place with other regulators since the crisis, like the Volcker rule, are really quite complex, and we \u2019re working \u2014we believe we should \u2014and we \u2019re working with other regulators to try to see if we can find ways , while carrying out what Dodd- Frank  intended, that banking organizations not be involved in proprietary trading .", "Your second questi on asked about what impact the F ed has had on income distribution because of the fact that stocks and homes tend to be disproportionate ly owned .", "So, I would say , look, we were faced with a huge recession that took an enormous toll in terms of depriving large numbers of people \u2014and disproportionatel y lower -income people who are less advantaged in the labor m arket \u2014found themselves without work.", "We had a 10 percent unemployment rate, and our congressional mandate is maximum employment and price stability.", "So we set monetary policy not with a view tow ard affecting the distribution of income, but toward pursuing those congressionally mandated goals .", "And I am pleased to see the unemployment rate and every other measure that I know of pertaining to the labor m arket show dramatic improvement over these years, and that is hugely important to the economic well- being not at the top end of the  wealth and income distribution, September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 18 of 25  but to the bottom end of the income distribution .", "And w e have seen this year median income in real terms rise significantly , with gains throughout the income distribution.", "He \u2019s made enormous contributions to t he FOMC  and to the broader work of the Federal Reserve, and I have real ly enjoyed working with him and appreciated his wise counsel and friendship.", "I have full confidence that even if that happens, we will be able to carry out our compleme nt of responsibilities.", "Th ere\u2019s\u2014every action that we are allowed to take under the Federal Reserve Act can be taken, even if we are a B oard of three , although we will have to abide, as we always do, by the restrictions that are part  of the Government  in the Sunshine  Act.", "But, perhaps more important than that, I think it\u2019s very important to have a broad range of views around the table as we  deliberate on policy actions.", "I look forward to working with him , and, you know, I hope that the Administration will make other nominations to fill our slots.", "Look, that \u2019s something that \u2019s a matter for Congress and the White House to decide.", "You know, I \u2019ve put forward  a few principles about fiscal policy that I would reiterate, that one of the problems that the  American economy suffers from, along with many other economies around the globe, is slow productivity growth, and I think it would be very desirable if a fiscal package had the potential in it to create incentives that would raise productivity growth.", "We do face, in terms of longer -term deficits as the population ages, an unsustainable debt path that will require, I beli eve, some adjustments to fiscal p olicy, and I hope Congress will keep that in mind .", "So , starting with the last part of the question, I mean, my own judgment, based on my experience and  the economic research that has tried to estimate the effectiveness of our balance s heet actions starting in 2008 and has also looked at the similar balance s heet actions in other parts of the world, including the  euro area, is that these actions were successful in making financial conditions more accommodative and , I believe, in stimulating a faster recovery than we otherwise would ha ve had .", "A recent Fed working paper estimated that the full set of balance s heet actions that we took during the crisis may have lowered long -term interest rates by about 100 basis points.", "It will b e up to future policymakers to decide, in the event of a severe downturn, whether they think it \u2019s appropriate to again resort to balance sheet \u2014to adding assets to a balance sheet.", "I would say that if economists are correct that we\u2019 re living in a world w here the level of neutral interest rates not only in the United States, but around the world is likely to be low in the future September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen\u2019s  Press Conference  FINAL  Page 21 of 25  due to slow productivity growth and demographics \u2014now , we don\u2019 t know that that view will bear out to be correct, but it is a view th at many people adhere to when there is evidence of it \u2014then future policymakers will be faced with the question of, in the event of a severe downturn where they \u2019re not able to provide as much stimulus as they would ideally like by cutting overnight interest  rates, what other actions are available to them ?", "And during the crisis , we bought longer -term assets and used forward guidance, and for my own part, I would want to keep those things in the toolkit as being available.", "It will be up to future policymakers  to decide how to rank those, or whether or not there might be other options that are available to them, but I don\u2019 t think this issue will go away, although perhaps it \u2019s only \u2014well, this could well be a decision that future policymakers will have to face in  the event of a significant asset \u2014economic shock.", "I mean, you asked me what would it take for us to resume reinvestment, and I can\u2019 t really say much more than we said in the guidance that we provided, which is that if there is a material deterioration in the economic outlook and we thought we might be faced with a  situation where we would  need to substantially cut the f ederal f unds r ate and could be limited by the so -called zero lower bound, it is that type of determination that our C ommittee is saying would \u2014might lead us to resume reinvestment.", "So that is a somewhat high bar to resume reinvestments, and that \u2019s why , in answering previous questions, I would say , well, yo u know, if there\u2019s  some small, negative  shock, our first tool \u2014our most import ant and reliable tool\u2014will be the federal funds r ate.", "B ut if there is a significant shock that\u2019s a  material deterioration to the outlook, we would consider resuming reinvestment.", "We saw during the financial crisis that some systemically important nonbanking organizations like Lehman and AIG \u2014that their distress produce d broad systemic consequences that were adverse for the U .S.", "economy .", "And having the ability to designate firms wh en the FSOC makes the determination that their distress or failure could have systemic repercussions, I believe that \u2019s an important \u2014that \u2019s an important policy tool for FSOC to have available.", "Firms may change their business models or just how they conduct their business, and we should welcome de -designation of firms if their business model is changed in a way that leads us to believe that their failure or distress would no longer be systemically important and those are decisions that we make every year.", "GE Capital dramatically changed its business model  and was de- designated , and, you know, I believe it \u2019s a process that works.", "We would really urge consumers now to be very careful in monitoring their credit reports and financial situation .", "And, through our supervision, we\u2019re working with the banks that we supervise to make sure that they take appropriate actions with respect to their business processes in light of the fact that there could be breaches or fraudulent transactions or information that they received that the y might use \u2014for example, in credit determinations \u2014could be contaminated by bad data .", "More generally, it points to the importance of strong cybersecurity controls and attention to cybersecurity risks, which we do see as one of the most significant risks to the financial sector .", "And we are very focused in our banking supervision in making sure that banks have appropriate controls in place .", "So , first of all

are working down our balance sheet because we feel that \u2019s stimulus that in some sense is no longer needed.", "So the basic message here is , U.S. economic performance has been good .", "The labor m arket has st rengthened subst antially.", "Every measure of the labor m arket, whether it \u2019s the narrow unemployment rate, the broader unemployment rate, the number of people working in part -time jobs who want full -time work, the level of job openings, the quit  rate, the di fficulty that firms are facing in hiring workers, the level of confidence we see in surveys about the labor

strong labor market on a sustainable basis .", "And in making these judgments about the path of policy, we have to balance various risks.", "One risk is that if we tighten policy too quickly, we may find out that , although we don \u2019t think this now, that the inflation shortfall is something that\u2019 s going to be persistent .", "And if we tighten too quickly, we could undermine inflation

quite as strong this year as , for example, as it was in 2016, we \u2019re still averaging 175,000 jobs a month this year, which is quite a bit above the pace of maybe 100 to 120,000 that would be
