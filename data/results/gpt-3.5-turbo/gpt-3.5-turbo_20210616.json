driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy.", "So, for example, the experience with, with  lumber prices is , is illustrative of this.", "The thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like, t hey should stop going up, and at some point , they, they, in some cases , should actually go down.", "Another example where we haven \u2019t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation.", "Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply.", "It \u2019s going up at just an amazing annual rate.", "That narrative seems, still seems quite likely to prove correct, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the , the timing of that is , is pretty uncertain, and so are the , the effects in the ne ar term.", "But over time, it seems June 16, 2021    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 of 30  likely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be \u2014will be temporary.", "I\u2019ll , I\u2019ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum -employment goal, but also for inflation.", "And , and as I \u2014as I mentioned, we expect and I expe ct that we\u2019ll see increases in supply over coming months as the factors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate, wane, move down.", "So I , I can \u2019t give you an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down.", "If you look at the \u2014if you look at the  forecast for 2021 and\u2014sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the , on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal.", "And I think the fu ll range of, of, of inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent , which is consistent with our\u2014with our goals.", "But you can think of this meeting t hat we had as the \u201ctalking about talking about \u201d meeting, if you like.", "And I now suggest that we retire that term, which has \u2014which has  served its purpose well, I June 16, 2021    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 10 of 30  think.", "So Committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in Dece mber, the economy has clearly made progress, although we are still a ways from our goal of substantial further progress.", "And assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting.", "So at coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy \u2019s progress toward our goals, and we \u2019ll give advance notice before announcing any decision.", "So we , we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations, because that \u2019s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation.", "So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices.", "So you\u2019ll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you\u2019ll see the shorter -term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up.", "And , and that\u2019s, that\u2019s  maybe not a good signal for future inflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again.", "June 16, 2021    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of 30  So we\u2014ye s, I think if, if you look at the broad range of longer- term inflation expectations, they\u2019ve moved up.", "They moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, you know, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been , where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard tim e stopping that process once it begins.", "So it \u2019s, it\u2019s good, actually , to see inflation \u2014longer- term inflation expectations move back up to a range \u2014it\u2019s a range that \u2019s consistent with what our objectives are.", "These are not precise me asures , and that\u2019s \u2014and they , they contain risk premiums of various kinds.", "And that \u2019s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of economists, surveys of the public , and also market  based.", "And , by the way, they\u2019ve  been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago, at a time when inflation was , was, was still anchored at around 2 percent  or maybe even a little bit below.", "And, you know, as you know, it \u2019s, it\u2019s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to assure that inflation\u2014longer- term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal.", "If, if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that \u2019s consistent with your goal, it \u2019s not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the  longer term.", "On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at substantial further progress is one that the Committee will make.", "That is \u2014that is , you know, the process that we \u2019re beginning now at the next meeting.", "We will begin, meeting by meeting, to, to assess that progress and talk about  what we \u2014what we  think we\u2019re seeing and, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases.", "In terms of the , the, the two hikes \u2014so let me say a couple things  first of all, not for the first time, about the \u2014about the  dot plot.", "These are, of course, individual projections.", "They\u2019re not a Committee forecast, they\u2019re not a plan.", "If you look at the transcripts from five years ago, you\u2019ll see that sometimes people mention their rate path  in their interventions.", "And the last thing to say is, the dots are not a great forecaster of, of future rate June 16, 2021    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 of 30  moves.", "And that \u2019s not because \u2014it\u2019s just because it \u2019s so highly uncertain.", "There is no great forecaster of, of future dots.", "However, so let me talk about this , this, this  meeting.", "The Committee spelled out, as you know, in our FOMC statements the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the target range is made.", "And , as I mentioned, it \u2019s labor market conditions consistent wi th maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent  and on track to exceed 2 percent .", "In the projections, it gives some sense of how participants see the economy evolving in their most likely case.", "And , honestly, the main message I would take away from the SEP is that participants \u2014many, many participants are more comfortable that the economic conditions in the Committee\u2019s forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously anticipated.", "And that would be a welcome development.", "If such outcomes materialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals.", "So th e other thing I\u2019ll say is , rate increases are really not at all the focus of the Committee.", "The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy.", "But in terms of our tools, it \u2019s about asset purchases.", "The conditions for liftoff\u2014we \u2019re very far from maximum employment, for example.", "So the near-term thing is really \u2014the real near -term discussion , discussion that will begin is really  about the , the path of asset purchases.", "And , as I mentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, in future meetings , continue to think about our progress.", "And so all I can say is that we , we think it\u2019s important \u2014we think where the balance sheet \u2019s concerned, a lot of notice, as much transparency as we can give , and as far \u2014as far  in advance as we can to give people a chance to adjust their  expectations.", "And, you know, we expect to be in that business until we reach substantial further progress and then have a \u2014have a  decision.", "Again, as we \u2014as we approach that goal, we \u2019ll provide, you know, as much clarity as we can.", "You know, so as part of our year-and-a -half-long process, the review  that we did and came out with at the end of that with the \u2014with the  new S tatement on L onger-Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy, we looked  carefully at the idea.", "You know, it says that we will seek  to\u2014seek  inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent  for some time.", "And it\u2019s, it\u2019s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent  over time.", "And that under the old\u2014under the  old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was , 2 percent  was a  ceiling because all of the errors were below.", "You were always getting back to 2 percent .", "So on the \u2014on the  facility, we think it\u2019s doing its job.", "We think it\u2019s doing\u2014the reverse repo facility is , is doing what it \u2019s supposed to do, which is to provide a floor under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its\u2014well within  its range.", "It\u2019s doing\u2014you have an unusual situation where the T reasury General A ccount is , is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking.", "And so there \u2019s, there\u2019s  downward pressure \u2014we \u2019re buying assets \u2014there\u2019s downward pressure on short -term rates, and that facility is, is doing what we think it \u2019s supposed to do.", "But it \u2019s designed to keep the federal funds rate, you know, within the range.", "And I do think it could have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know, the very low rates and the downward pressures.", "We look at a range of indicators, and it \u2019s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly\u2014but , but, certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that.", "We \u2019re all going to be informed by what we saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period of time.", "Now, that hadn\u2019t happened in many other cycles , but this was a very long cycle.", "It is  a different \u2014it\u2019s  a different economy.", "So I think we \u2019re\u2014I think that  lesson number one is , is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment.", "And I think if you\u2014during the last cycle, there were \u2014there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early, June 16, 2021    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 18 of 30  you know, as , as 2012, when I arrived at the Fed.", "And , you know \u2014you know, nine years later \u2014eight years later, we were still creating jobs.", "At the same time, we understand this is a different economy.", "You asked about  wages.", "You know, we \u2019re seeing wage increases.", "That \u2019s, that\u2019s  sort of a natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy.", "And what we \u2019re seeing is \u2014we don\u2019t see anything that \u2019s troubling in the sense of\u2014what would be troubling would be, you know, very wide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation.", "In other words, wages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage \u2013price cycle.", "That\u2019s, that\u2019s  the old formula for\u2014one of the old formulas for having high inflation.", "We do see high wages.", "We see them for , for people who are mostly new, you know, entering into n ew jobs, many of them in low -skilled jobs.", "And, but we , we do think\u2014you\u2019ve got to\u2014you\u2019ve got to think in the labor market right now, where , where  supply and demand are just not matched up well.", "And, you know, we think it \u2019s a flexible economy and, and it will clear.", "There will \u2014there will be a level at which supply and demand meet.", "So\u2014but the last thing I \u2019ll say is, again, if you look at , at the forecasts, we  are going to be in a very st rong labor market pretty quickly here.", "But there \u2019s June 16, 2021    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 19 of 30  every reason to think that we \u2019ll be in a \u2014in a  labor market with very attractive numbers, with low unemployment, high participation, and rising wages across  the spectrum.", "So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a little bit how we \u2019re looking at the \u2014at the labor market.", "I don\u2019t have anything to share with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now, unfortunately.", "But we \u2019ve, we\u2019ve  always \u2014our position has been for a long time and, and it is now that we\u2019d, we\u2019d like the leverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements.", "When leverage requirements are, are, are  binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk ones.", "It \u2019s a stra ightforward thing.", "And because of the substantial increase in reserves, Treasuries , and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to be come \u2014ceasing to be  the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be.", "So we do think it\u2019s appropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment, and, and we \u2019re looking hard at the issue.", "We would also, just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or rec ommend do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements.", "So , really, the problem now is , is that demand is very, very strong.", "Incomes are high, people have money in their bank accounts.", "Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn \u2019t\u2014it hasn\u2019t  come down.", "We \u2019re seeing the service sector reopening.", "And so you\u2019re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there.", "But in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there , there  is a possibility on the other side of this tha t, that  inflation could be\u2014could actually be quite low going forward.", "Our  focus right now is , we need to \u2014our, our expectation is that these , these  high inflation readings that we \u2019re seeing now will start to abate.", "With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the other two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there \u2019s no reason to think that they\u2019re going to keep going up June 16, 2021    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 21 of 30  a lot.", "There \u2019s no reason for supply and dema nd to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time.", "I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there \u2019s a lot of uncertainty.", "The overall story is one that , that  we think is right, and we think the incoming data support it  and, you know, so do many, many forecasters.", "And if you look at the forecasts on the FOMC, you will \u2014you will  see that as well.", "But we don\u2019t \u2014we don\u2019t  in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that , that  this goes on longer than expected.", "And the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations.", "And if we see inflation expectations and inflation\u2014or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we \u2014what we  would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use our tools to address that.", "Price stability is half of our mandate , and we would certainly do that.", "And, and in that we\u2019re joined by many other forecasters, but there \u2019s a lot to be humble about among forecasters.", "Forecasters have a lot to be humble about.",

know, we should\u2014as I mentioned earlier, there \u2019s so much uncertainty around this.", "But , you know, you, you also saw in the United Kingdom, which has, I think, at least as high if not higher vaccination rates, they\u2019ve had an outbreak of the Delta variety.", "Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels \u2014it would be good to see it get to a substantially higher

\u2019ve seen growth coming higher than we expected.", "We\u2019ve seen very strong labor demand.", "We \u2019ve also seen \u2014we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think even though,
