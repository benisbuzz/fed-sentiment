["Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by \u00bc percentage point, bringing it to \u00bd to \u00be percent.", "In doing so, my colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made toward our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability.", "Over the past year, 2 \u00bc million net new jobs have been created, unemployment has fallen fu rther, and inflation has moved closer to our longer -run goal of 2 percent.", "We expect the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further and inflation rising to 2 percent over the next couple of years.", "I \u2019ll have more to s ay about monetary policy shortly, but first I \u2019ll review recent economic developments and the outlook.", "Economic growth has picked up since the middle of the year.", "Household spending continues to rise at a moderate pace, supported by income gains and by rel atively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth.", "Business investment, however, remains soft despite some stabilization in the energy sector.", "Overall, we expect the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.", "Job gains averaged ne arly 180,000 per month over the past three months, maintaining the solid pace that we \u2019ve seen since the beginning of the year.", "Over the past seven years, since the depths of the Great Recession, more than 15 million jobs have been added to the U.S. econom y.", "The unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, the lowest level since 2007, prior to the recession.", "Broader measures of labor market slack have also moved lower, and participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about t wo years now, a further sign of improved conditions in the labor market given the underlying downward trend in participation  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 2 of 20   stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population.", "Looking ahead, w e expect that job conditions will strengthen somewhat furt her.", "Turning to inflation, the 12- month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures was nearly 1 \u00bd percent in October, still short of our 2 percent objective but up more than a percentage point from a year earlier.", "Core inflation\u2014which excludes energy and food prices that tend to be more volatile than other prices \u2014has risen to 1\u00be percent.", "As the transitory influences of earlier declines in energy prices and prices of imports continue to fade and as the job market strengthens further, we  expect overall inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next couple of years.", "Our inflation outlook rests importantly on our judgment that longer -run inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.", "Market -based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but are still low.", "Survey -based measures of longer -run inflation expectations are, on balance, little changed.", "Of course, we remain committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward this goal.", "Let me now turn to the economic projections that were submitted for this meeting by Committee participants.", "As always, they conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy , which, in turn, depend on each participant \u2019s assessment of the multitude of factors that shape the outlook.", "The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product rises from 1.9 percent this year to 2.1 percent in 2017 and stays close to 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, slightly above its estimated longer -run rate.", "The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year.", "Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs at 4.5 pe rcent, modestly below the  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 3 of 20   median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.", "Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.5 percent this year and rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.", "Overall, these economic projections are very sim ilar to those made in September:  GDP growth is a touch stronger ; the unemployment rate is a shade lower ; and inflation, beyond this year, is unchanged.", "Returning to monetary policy, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal funds rate is appropriate in l ight of the solid progress we have  seen toward our goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.", "We continue to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achi eve and maintain our objectives.", "That \u2019s based on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate \u2014that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel \u2014is currently quite low by hist orical standards.", "With the federal funds rate only modestly below the neutral rate, we continue to expect that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years.", "This view is co nsistent with participants \u2019 projections of appropriate monetary policy.", "The median projection for the federal funds rate rises to 1.4 percent at the end of next year, 2.1 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.9 percent by the end of 2019.", "Compared with the projections made in September, the median path for the federal funds rate has been revised up just \u00bc percentage point.", "Only a few participants altered their estimate of the longer -run normal federal funds rate, although the median edged up to 3 percent.", "Of course, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks.", "As many observers have noted, changes  in fiscal policy  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 4 of 20   or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook.", "Moreover, changes in fiscal policy are only one of the many factors that can influence the outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy.", "In making our policy decisions, we will continue \u2014as always \u2014to assess economic conditions relative to our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.", "As I have noted on previous occasions, policy is not on a preset course.", "Finally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities.", "As our statement says, we anticipate continuing this policy \u201c until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.", "Well, I would like to emphasize that this is a very modest adjustment in the path of the federal funds rate and involves changes by only, you know, some of, you know, some of the participants.", "The unemployment rate is perhaps a touch, as I said, a touch lower than previously ; you\u2019ve seen some modest downward revisions in that \u2014in that  projection.", "For this year, there was a slight u pward revision to inflation, and some of the participants , but not all of the participants , did incorporate some assumption of a change in fiscal policy into their projections.", "So the statement that I made , that  it would be useful to increase the productive capacity of the economy , reflects my concern that productivity growth has been very low.", "It\u2019s the ultimate determination of the evolution of living standards.", "Policies that would improve productivity growth would include policy changes that enhance education, training, workforce development ; policies that spur either private or public investment to enhance the quality of capital in the United States that workers have to work with;  and policie s that spur innovation or competition or the formation of new firms.", "I don\u2019 t think there \u2019s anything that I could say in general about what tax policy would do , but that \u2014and I really can \u2019t tell you what the F ed\u2019s response would be to any policy changes that are put into effect.", "I wouldn\u2019 t want to speculate until I  were more certain of the details and how they would affect the likely course of the economy.", "I\u2014you know, it \u2019s some thing I really just can \u2019t generalize about because, w hile it would be desirable to have tax policies that do increase the productive capacity  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 6 of 20   of the economy , an increase in the pace of productivity change is one of the factors  that does affect the economy \u2019s neutral rate.", "A  boost to prod uctivity could spur investment .", "As we have been saying , we estimate that the value of the neu tral federal funds rate is quite  low\u2014has \u2014and one of the reasons for that is s low productivity growth.", "And so it \u2019s very hard to ge neralize about it because it could affect that neutral rate.", "So let me say that our decision to raise rates is \u2014should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confi dence we have in the pr ogress  the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue .", "And the economy ha s proven to be remarka bly resilient.", "So it is a vote of  confidence in the economy.", "As you know, this was a decision that was well anticipated in markets , and I think it will have relatively small effect on market rates.", "It could boost very slightly some short -term interest rates that could have an effect on borrowing costs that are linked to them, but , overall, I think that households and firms will see very  modest changes from this decision.", "But , certainly, it\u2019 s important for households and businesses to understand that my colleagues and I have judged the course of the U .S.", "economy to be strong , that we \u2019re making progress toward our inflation and unemployme nt goals.", "We have a  strong labor market , and we have a resilient economy.", "So I would agree that \u2014and as  we said in our statement \u2014policy remains accommodative.", "The degree of accommodation I would characterize as moderate.", "As I\u2019ve emphas ized and said in the statement, we currently judge the neutral level of the federal funds rate to be pretty low.", "Remember that inflation is still below our objective.", "The C ommittee projects \u2014at least the median projection shows a very modest undershoot of estimates  of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment.", "The median unemployment rate here gets down to 4\u00bd percent, which is just a few tenths below the estimated longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate.", "And we think that that \u2019s appropriate because we want inflation to rise to our 2 percent  objective in a timely fashion.", "So there is not a substantial undershoot of the natural rate of unemployment.", "We \u2019re not seeing evidence in labor markets of very substantial upward pressures on labor that could signify extreme shortages of labor that could propel inflation higher in a very rapid way, and inflation is still operating below our objective.", "But , of course , the outlook is uncertain.", "We recognize that there are many sources of uncertainty affecting the outlook.", "And we will have to ad just our thinking as things evolve, as conditions \u2014conditions evolve, and we learn more about economic policy changes that could affect the outlook.", "Well, I believe my predecessor and I called for fiscal stimulus when the unemployment rate was substantially higher  than it is now.", "So, with a 4.6 percent  unemployment and a solid labor ma rket, there may be some additional slack in labor markets , but I would judge that the degree of slack has diminished.", "So I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment.", "But , nevertheless, let me be careful that I  am not trying to provide advice t o the new A dministration or to Congress as to what is the appropriate stance of policy.", "There are many considerations th at Congress needs to take account of and many bases for justif ying changing fiscal policy.", "I\u2019ve continued to highlight the importance of spurring productivity growth, that I think that would be something that \u2019s beneficial for the economy.", "Of course , it\u2019s also important for Congress to take account of the fact that , as our population ages , that the debt -to-GDP ratio is projected to rise , and that needs to continue to be taken into account.", "So I want to be clear that what I said in that speech in Boston is that an important research question is whether or not , in an economy with a very strong labor market , there might be changes that took place that permanently raised the labor force participation , training , and other thing s of the labor \u2014of the labor force that would be positives for the productive potential of our economy on a long -lasting basis.", "I never said that I favor running a high-pressure economy.", "And, you know, as you can see in the SE P projections of the particip ants\u2014and this has long been true not just in this forecast , but in earlier ones as well \u2014you see a modest undershooting.", "The under \u2014unemployment rate is projected to modestly undershoot , for several years, levels that are deemed to be normal in the longer r un.", "T hat\u2019s an appropriate policy  purely on the grounds that inflation is running below our objective.", "And while we do n\u2019t want to overshoot our 2 percent  objective, we also don\u2019 t want a  persistent undershoot of our 2 percent  objective, and that does  invol ve a labor market that may succeed in attracting more people off the sidelines into the labor market.", "But I do want to make clear that I have not recommended running a \u201chot\u201d economy as some sort of experiment.", "Well, I \u2019m not going to offer the incoming P resident advice about how to conduct himself in policy.", "We have been given the independence by Congress to make decisions about monetary policy in pursuit of our dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and inflation , and that is what I intend to stay focused on.", "\u2014the f inancial rate.", "So, okay, on financial regulation, I feel that we live d through a  devastating financial crisis that took a huge toll on our economy.", "And most members of Congress and the public came away from that exper ience feeling that it was important to take a set of steps that would result in a safer and stronger financial system.", "That has been our mission since the financial crisis for the last six or seven years.", "I think it \u2019s very important that we have reduced the odds that a systemically important firm could fail by requiring higher capital, higher liquidity , by performing stress tests that provide us another way of e nsuring that th e firms we count on to supply credit to households and businesses would be able to go on doing that even in the face of a severely adverse shock.", "The firms \u2014the largest firms have a great deal more capital than they did before the crisis.", "I would advise that \u2014and we have been trying to do this \u2014that it\u2019 s important to look for ways to relieve regulatory burden on community banks and smaller i nstitutions , to tailor regulation so that it\u2019 s appropriate for the systemic risk profile of the particular institutions.", "And the living wills process has been about that , and I think we \u2019ve made considerable progress in making sure that the  largest and most systemic firms conduct their businesses in a day -to-day way with some thought about \u2014with important  thinking in place about whether or not the way they are conducting their business would aid resolution in the event that they encountered a  severe negative shock.", "There may be some changes that could be made, and we \u2019ve suggested a few , like eliminating the burden of compliance with the Volcker  rule, or incentive compensation, regulations for smaller banks , or modestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to enhance d prudential supervision.", "So we did discuss the se topics in our meeting today.", "I would simply summarize by saying that all the  FOMC participants recognize that  there is considerable uncertainty about how economic policies may change and what effect they will have on the economy.", "And in so far as that  will affect monetary policy, of course we will have to factor those policies along with many other things, including the global environment and oil prices and other matters.", "We will have to factor that into our outlook and figure out what is an appropria te response.", "But we \u2019re operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment , and we have time to wait to see what changes occur and to factor those into our decisionmaking as we gain greater clarity.", "You mentioned the market moves.", "So I see the market mo ves as implicit forecast s about what impact these policies are likely to have on the economy.", "The changes \u2014the financial market changes that you described, particularly the increase in stock prices, the increase in longer -term rates , and the strengthening of the dollar , suggest that many market participants anticipate expansionary fiscal policies that would raise interest rate s somewhat in the United States relative to abroad and would cause a  strengthening in the dollar.", "But market participants were uncertain too, and I would expect changes in our understanding of what is going to happen to also affect market prices in financial markets as we move forward.", "My colleagues write down their best estimates of a normal longer -run unemployment rate.", "The median stands at 4.8 percent, so we \u2019re close, possibly \u2014the unemployment rate right now is ever so slightly below , but in the nei ghborhood.", "If we look at la rger, broader mea sures of slack , like the U -6 measure that includes involuntary part -time employment and those who are marginally attached to the labor force, t hey\u2019re slightly higher than pre -recession levels, but they \u2019ve come down considerably.", "We look a t a broad array of i ndicators of the labor market, a nd if you look at job openings or the hires  rate or the quits  rate or difficulty of hiring workers as reported in business surveys, you know, I would say the labor market looks a lot like the way it did before the recession , that it\u2019 s\u2014we\u2019re roughly comparable to 2007 levels when we thought the, you know, there was a normal amount of slack in the labor market.", "The labor market was in the vicinity of maximum employment.", "So I guess the way I think about it is that I was confirmed by the Senate to a four -year term.", "The term of the Fed Chair was not meant to coincide with that of the President , and there were good reasons for that , too.", "And so I do intend to serve out my four -year term.", "So, you know, I really don \u2019t want to comment on the level of stock prices .", "They may have been boosted by expectations about tax policy ; possible cuts in corporate tax rates that have been much discussed ; or by expectations about growth, possible reductions , and downside risk to the economy.", "But, you know, these are things tha t market participants are trying to view , along with the likely path of \u2014paths of interest rates, and I think all of that factors into movements and stock valuations.", "Well, I think rates of return in the stock market relative to \u2014remember that the level of interest rates is low , and , taking that into account, I believe it\u2019 s fair to say that they remain within normal ranges.", "Well, there have been many ways in which there have been compliance failures at large organizations , and you\u2019 ve seen a series of enforcement actions by the banking regulators over a range of practices that suggest s some breakdown of compliance or culture, whether it involves violations of sanctions or foreign exchange or LIBOR or other matters.", "We \u2019ve already beg un this year , broadly , of compliance and management of compliance risk in the largest corporations .", "One of the things we \u2019ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history and around the globe is that , very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a recession, that productivity doesn\u2019 t pick up to pre -recession levels and that there looks like there is a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy , which is called \u201c hysteresis.", "\u201d  And I raise d the question as to whether or not this might operate in the opposite direction as well.", "We have seen quite a few people who lost their jobs duri ng the G reat R ecession drop out of the labor force  and, you know, lose their ties and become discouraged and not reenter.", "And I raised the question a s to whether or not hysteresis could operate in the opposite direction.", "And that was a research question for economist s to see if there is any evidence, because it could be important in determining policy.", "But I didn\u2019t \u2014I didn\u2019 t draw any policy conclusions from that.", "And , as I indicated, I think the path that you see \u2014that the Committee has laid out in a tentative way that involves a modest degree of undershooting of normal longer -run levels of unemployment going down to around 4\u00bd percent would remain for a couple of years \u2014might provide some insight.", "So I was not recommending a substantially easier policy in order to test that hypothesis.", "It\u2019s important for market participants to have a sense of how we think about the economy and the appropriate path of policy , to look at incoming data , and to form their own judgments as to whether or not changes in policy would be appropriate.", "And while  it\u2019s not a prerequisite , if we \u2019re in good sync in terms of explaining what goes into our policy judgments , it\u2019s not surprising that it would often be true that moves are well anticipated by the market.", "I think anyone looking at incoming data can clearly see that we have enjoyed further progress both in the labor market and on inflation.", "And , therefore, there are good reasons why the market should have antic ipated a moved today.", "I haven \u2019t weighed in on either fiscal policy , specifics of evaluating policies.", "I\u2019m not going to weigh in either on the details of particular trade policies.", "There were a lot of manufacturing jobs lost over a long period of time and particularly after \u2014during the G reat R ecession.", "We\u2019ve had some recovery in manufacturing employment as the econom y\u2019s recovered.", "So, to some extent, manufacturing employment  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 18 of 20   depends on the progress of the economy, and we have seen some recovery.", "Over a long period  of time, technological change  is something that has been important in reducing manufacturing employment absolutely and as  a share of jobs in the economy.", "For decades, the pace of technological change in manufacturing has outstripped that in the economy as a whole.", "You mentioned worker assistance.", "So some of the forces that are acting on manufacturing and other sectors , including technological change and globalization\u2014e ven though most economists would judge the overall consequences of these developments for the economy to be positive, certainly there are groups of workers who were harmed by developments pertaining to glo balization and technology.", "And I think most economists and policymakers recognize that it \u2019s important to provide ways for workers who were harmed by these kinds of developments to be retrained for jobs so that they can succeed in the economy.", "And so, I m ean, I would agree \u2014without getting into any particular program and whether it\u2019 s sufficient , I do think that it\u2019 s important to recognize there are those who were harmed by these developments , and their concerns, I think, need to be addressed by policymaker s, certainly.", "So we \u2019ve indicated in our normalization principles that we expect to diminish the size of our portfolio over time l argely by ceasing reinvestments of principal rather  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 19 of 20   than by selling securities.", "We \u2019ve indicated that once the process of normalization of the federal funds rate is well under way, we would probably begin to allow our portfolio to run off.", "We want to feel that if the economy w ere to suffer an adverse shock, that we have some scope through traditional means of interest rate cuts to be able to respond to that.", "Now, there\u2019 s no mechanical r ule about what level of the federal funds rate we might deem appropriate to begin that process.", "It\u2019s not something that only depends on the le vel of the federal funds rate .", "It also depends on our judgment of the amount of momentum in the economy and poss ible concerns about downside risks to  the economy.", "So we \u2019ve not yet made this decision, but it is something that we have long planned, to begin to allow our balance sheet to run off.", "And we would end up, if all goes well, with a  substantially smalle r balance sheet than we have at  present.", "Well, I mean, we \u2019ve long been aware, a nd I\u2019ve spoken about previously disturbing trends in the economy, particularly rising wage inequality, income inequality, and the fact that a significant share of our population hasn\u2019 t been enjoying significant real wage gains , if any.", "And so these are long -standi ng concerns.", "These are not new phenomenon, but the recession was very severe and probably exacerbated developments that had  December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  Page 20 of 20   long been affecting many American workers and households.", "Now, the

attentive with respect to particular demographic groups in the labor market .", "We\u2019ve been focused on it \u2014it\u2019s not just since the election \u2014and are pleased to see that they are
