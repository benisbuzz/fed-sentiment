think one of  the most important lessons from the financial crisis is really the importan ce of the stability of the financi al system.", "And so we\u2014since the financial crisis, as you\u2019re aw are, we\u2019ve had a major focus on b uilding up our monitoring of financial conditions and financial  stability issues.", "We\u2019ve als o put in place many, many initiatives to strengthen the f

look at it the other way: You can ask, if all  of the tariffs that have been a nnounced are applied, what would be the effect at the aggregate le vel?", "One is loss of business confidence, which

U.S. economy.", "Oh, supply- side effects, yeah.", "You know, the idea is, you cut\u2014you reduce taxation on corporations and particularly\u2014and allow faster expensing for investment.", "The id ea is to encourage more investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes.", "So t he effects are very uncertain,

perform\u2014labor Page 12 of 29       September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL force participation has surpri sed us on the upside.", "There is a  long-run trend there, and we\u2019ve now had basically five flat  years.", "If you look\u2014if you look at labor force participation, since the fourth quarter of \u201913 till now, you really have a\u2014kind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of  a significant downward trend, thanks to aging and other factors.", "That\u2019s a gain of well more than a percentage point in  participation, so that\u2019s really\u2014 that\u2019s really a good thing.", "Those are people who are remaining  in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs, finding jobs .", "It\u2019 s one of the things that ha s allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further.", "And it\u2019 s a\u2014it\u2019s a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply side, that there may be more labo r supply than th e prior trend would indicate.", "So it\u2019s a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force.", "And, you know, we don\u2019t know how long it can continue.",

prices moving up.", "The tariffs Page 13 of 29      September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL might provide a basis for companie s to raise prices in a world where they\u2019ve

just talking about the effect on inflati on is, is it just a one-time increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling  higher inflation going forward?", "You know, don\u2019t see it yet, but we\u2014you\u2019re hearing\u2014I mean, broadly across the economy, it\u2019s not just tarif fs.", "You\u2019re hearing\u2014we\u2019re hearing a lot of talk of labor s hortages, of material costs in particular industries.", "We\u2019re hearing a lot, you know, what amount to supply -side constraints and things like that, but we\u2019re not seeing it.", "We\u2019re seeing a sort of modest  increase in wages, inflation  right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we\u2019re not seeing it yet.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a new point that forecasts two and  three out\u2014two or three years out are fairly uncertain.", "The dot plot  is individual FOMC particip ants who are writing down their individual views on the evolu tion of the economy and of appropr iate monetary policy.", "These are individual forecasts.", "I think market participants generally find that interesting information, and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose.", "You know, we put that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and  the idea was to provide assurance that we weren\u2019t trying to slo w down the economy, but, in fact, we were still\u2014interest rates were still going to be pushing to suppor t economic activity.", "Well, that\u2014you know, that purpose has been well served, and the language now doesn\u2019t really say anyth ing that\u2019s important to the way the Committee is thinking about policy going forward.", "And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we\u2019re taking them into account.", "But if you look at\u2014look at interest rates, you know, interest r ates\u2014look at long-term interest rates this year and short-term int erest rates this year, there\u2019 s very significant increases.", "And, you Page 15 of 29     September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL know, with your long and variable lag s, that should be\u2014that sho uld be having an effect over time.", "Okay, so in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, completely under the control of  the White House and, ultimately , the President.", "But these are\u2014these are really decisions for the Wh ite House, and, you know, we are\u2014think of us as just being c onsulted.", "I will say that I\u2019m v ery happy and excited about the team that we\u2019re putting together , and I\u2019m very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled.", "S o we\u2019re looking forward to getti ng some people confirmed.", "In terms of corporate debt, so t his is a\u2014this is a\u2014you know, I was an investor for a long time in areas that were very clo se to the leveraged lending markets.", "And, you know, the banks take much l ess risk than they used to.", "They\u2019re\u2014the\u2014they\u2019re Page 16 of 29       September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL essentially in the business of distributing these loans and bon ds rather than keeping them on their balance sheet, to a much greater  degree.", "But it\u2019s also true\u2014an d there\u2019s significant research on this\u2014that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending market s does have channels for affecting the real economy, if there\u2019s overheating and that kin d of thing in those markets, so we monitor that carefully.", "You know , the guidance is \u2014isn\u2019t binding, as you pointed out, that the leveraged lending isn\u2019t binding, a nd that\u2019s just\u2014that\u2019s just th e way that the law is interpreted.", "So it\u2019s something we\u2019re monito ring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate.", "So I thin k if you look at the\u2014look at the dot plot in the S EP, you\u2019ll see that the federa l funds rate, even after today\u2019s move, is below the longer-run neu tral estimate of every single participant that\u2014who submits a\u2014 an estimate of that.", "So that\u2019s why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you know, it\u2019s perfectly clear that there can\u2019t be a signal because, you know, by definition, that means an accommodative policy.", "So it wasn\u2019t because policy is not accommodative.", "You know, what we\u2019re g oing to be doing, assuming we Page 17 of 29         September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL stay on this path, is, we\u2019re going to be carefully monitoring i ncoming data from the financial markets and from the economy a nd asking ourselves whether our policy is achieving the goals we want to achieve\u2014you know, sustai n the economy, maximum emplo yment, stable prices.", "That\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it, and that does kind of a mount to thinking less about one\u2019s precise point estimate of the ne utral rate.", "And, as I mentioned, many of the participan ts have written that down, and  they\u2019ve written down really modest overshoots, you know, amoun ting to one rate hike kind of  thing, which wouldn\u2019t have a big effect on the economy.", "Maybe we\u2019ve underestimated the neutral rate.", "Maybe we\u2019ll  be raising our estimate of the n eutral rate and we\u2019 ll just go to that, or maybe we\u2019ll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or tw o rate increases beyond it.", "The question we\u2019re answering is, how  do we provide the economy just the right amount of support\u2014 not too much, not too little\u2014to susta in the recovery and achieve our statutory goals?", "The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was th e\u2014as I mentioned, I think, earlie r, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system.", "So I think if you look\u2014 if you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the econ omy, that\u2019s what was missing, and I think it\u2019s not missing anymore.", "We raised capital, liquidity.", "We  have stress tests, which force banks to understand\u2014the largest banks particularly\u2014to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that\u2019s at least as bad as th e financial crisis.", "So I think those are the rea lly important lessons, and, you know, we\u2014we\u2019re determined not to, you know, not to forget them .", "I saw the article you\u2019re talking about; the question is, did Congress take things away, emergency powers from the Fed?", "S o there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under Page 19 of 29         September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 13, section 13(3), to provide s upport to individual nonbanks, w hich is really holding companies and other companies.", "In exchange for that, we got orderly liqu idation authority and a resolution authority.", "You know, the third thing you ment ioned is the designation powe r.  So it\u2019s a really important power.", "In my mind, it should be used\u2014my thinking, it  should be used sparingly, and that means, you know, in situations where you have\u2014I mean, in principle, you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that\u2019s not a bank, and it could be very threatening\u2014or it could be capab le of creating systemic risk.", "And so I think it\u2019s a critical power to have.", "Yeah, we look\u2014of  course, we look at that very  carefully, and interest rates are going up acro ss a broad range of consumer bo rrowing, as they would when we raise short-term interest ra tes.", "And the other thing I\u2019ll say is, take\u2014if you take  housing, if you look at the NAR A ffordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was be fore the financial crisis.", "S o you\u2019re right that the cost of borrowing is going up, but it\u2019s going up from what were extraor dinarily low levels, and it is Page 20 of 29      September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL something that we watch carefully.", "You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very important channel through whic h interest rates work, and so we do monitor the effects.", "Well, at th e Fed, we are, you know, deeply co mmitted to the mission of CRA, which is for banks  to provide credit and other banking services in the communities they serve.", "And we  have also been of the view for some time that with the evolution of technology particular ly and changes\u2014changes in the  nature of banking, that it\u2019s an appropriate time\u2014it\u2019s past an a ppropriate time, but now it\u2019s ce rtainly an appropriate time to revisit the way we think about C", "So, in principle,  the\u2014these starred variables\u2014the long-run growth rate of the economy, the neutral ra te of interest, the n atural rate of unemployment\u2014don\u2019t move quickly.", "They move very gr adually.", "They\u2019re  pinned down b y longer-run forces, like demographics.", "In the case of the funds rate, it\u2019s more\u2014it\u2019s pr oductivity\u2014it\u2019s appetite for safe assets and demographics and other things, too.", "It\u2019 s a tenth we\u2019re talking about here, so\u2014but still, I think it\u2019 s a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate and poten tially the longer-run growth r ate.", "And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which  has been the trend.", "They don\u2019t change a lot, though, although they did\u2014it\u2019s interesting that  the neutra l rate changed quite sharply after the financial crisis in many di fferent models, and it\u2019s been slow to recover.", "I don\u2019t expect a dramatic recovery there, but, you know, we\u2014we\u2019re so bad at fore casting productivity.", "So, you know , some of the things that we\u2019d be looking at to tell us whether we\u2019re getti ng close to supply-side limits wo uld be, first, does job growth slow down?", "A slowing down in job grow th would be an indicator, you know.", "An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or infla tion could tell you that you\u2019re reach ing those points.", "You know, if headline growth slowed down, that\u2019 s another one.", "I think also, though, we\u2019ve seen s ometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we saw at the beginning of 2016, can ha ve a substantial effect pre tty quickly on our economy if it\u2019s a broad and significant tight ening.", "So, in terms of divergence, yes.", "So the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, heal thy labor market, inflation right on target, as I mentioned.", "So\u2014a nd we\u2019ve seen growth abroad, bu t growth, I think, both in advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed do wn a little bit.", "And in that world, you know, if the U.S. is stro nger, then that\u2019s just part  of the context, part of the environment that could mean a  higher dollar.", "It could be\u2014it co uld therefore mean that some of our demand will wind up being shared with other economies.", "That\u2019s the way the integrated international economy works.", "So you could see that, and, you k now, it\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019 s just all of the\u2014all things tha t go into thinking about, you know, the path of the economy.", "Page 23 of 29         September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL I would say, you know, we\u2019re not res ponsible for the dollar.", "O f course, the Treasury is responsible for managing the dol lar, but the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it had in 2017.", "So we\u2019ve said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal funds rate trains\u2014trade s within the target range.", "And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserv es and then, at the bottom end, a reverse repo facility.", "So we\u2014in June, when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on exce ss reserves by 20 basis points and raised the range by 25, and that move d federal funds sort of back into the range.", "The federal  funds rate traded in the low 19 0s, well within the range.", "We think it\u2019s principally a f unction just of a number of things , but particularly high Treasury supply, and\u2014which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well.", "You know, we look\u2014we look at a  range of indicators of wages, and I think the broader, the better.", "You really\u2014in a perfect\u2014a perfect wage measure would also include benefits, because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages, so I think it\u2019 s right to choose those broade r ones.", "If y ou look at the principal four that we look at\u2014we look at a w hole range of wage and benefit co st indicators\u2014they are all now showing
