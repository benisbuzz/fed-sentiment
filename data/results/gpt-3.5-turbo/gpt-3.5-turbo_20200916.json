["At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us \u2014maximum employment and price stability.", "Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.", "Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I made some important changes to our policy statement, including an update to our guidance for the likely path of our policy interest rate.", "Guided by our new Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we announced a f ew weeks ago, these changes clarify our strong commitment over a longer time horizon.", "Before describing today\u2019s policy actions, let me briefly review recent economic developments.", "Economic activity has picked up from its depressed second- quarter level, wh en much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus.", "With the reopening of many businesses and factories and fewer people withdrawing from social interactions, household spending looks to have recovered about three -quarters of its earlier decline.", "The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment  benefits, which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes.", "Activity in the housing sector has returned to its level at the beginning of the year, and we are starting to see signs of an improvement in business investment.", "The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our June Summary of September 16, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 2 of 32  Economic Projections.", "Even so, overall activity remains well below its level before the pandemic and the path ahead remains highly uncertain.", "In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained as many people returned to work.", "The unemployment rate declined over the past four months but remains elevated at 8.4 percent as of August.", "Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the med ian projection is 7.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.5 percent next year, and 4 percent by 2023.", "The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.", "In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics.", "The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.", "The pandemic  has also left a significant imprint on inflation.", "For some goods, including food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income.", "More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and overall, inflation is running well below our 2 percent longer -run objective.", "The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.7 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023.", "As the economy began its recovery, COVID -19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths also rose.", "The reimposition of some social -distancing restrictions as well as more cautious behavior by many individuals have  succeeded in slowing the spread of the virus.", "As we have emphasized September 16, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 3 of 32  throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check.", "Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.", "A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.", "The path forward will also depend on the policy actions taken across all parts of the government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed.", "The Fede ral Reserve\u2019s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.", "We remain committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.", "The changes we made in today\u2019s policy statement reflect our strategy to achieve our dual -mandate goals by seeking to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment and achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as we articulated in our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.", "We view maximum employment as a broad -based and inclusive goal and do not see a high level of employment as posing a policy concern unle ss accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.", "And we believe that achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time helps ensure that longer -term inflation exp ectations remain well anchored at our longer -run 2 percent objective.", "In turn, well -anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation objectives, particularly in the new normal in which interest rates are closer to their effective lower bound even in good times.", "September 16, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 4 of 32  Hence, as we say in our statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we \u201cwill aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over  time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.", "\u201d  We expect \u201c to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes \u201d\u2014including maximum employment \u2014\u201care achieved.", "\u201d  With regard to interest rates, we now in dicate that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to \u00bc percent target range

on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.", "\u201d In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our \u201c holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities at least at the current pace.", "\u201d  The se asset purchases are intended \u201cto sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.\u201d  We believe the strong policy guidance we are providing today will  serve the economy well by promoting our goals through the many possible paths the recovery may take.", "Of course, as we note in our policy statement, we \u201c would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could im pede the attainment of our [the Committee\u2019s] goals.\u201d  The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local gove rnments.", "Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and promoting a robust recovery.", "Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in September 16, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 of 32  very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.", "These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and appear to have restored the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels.", "We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled , in large part , by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.", "As I have emphasized befo re, these are lending powers, not spending powers.", "Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy.", "In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.", "Elected officials hav e the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.", "The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country.", "Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes.", "It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.", "We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.", "We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.", "His outstanding analysis and advice have been indispensable to the FOMC and have played a key role in the policy decisions that will define this era of the Federal Reserve.", "So we say in our postmeeting statement that we\u2019 ll continue to increase our securities holdings \u201c at least at the current pace\u201d  over coming months \u201c to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.\u201d   That latter part is an updating of our guidance to reflect what I \u2019ve been saying in these press conferences for some time and what other central banks have acknowledged, which is that the purchases ar e fostering accommodative  financial conditions as well.", "So we, we think our \u2014we think our  policy stance is appropriate today, and we \u2019re prepar ed to adjust it going forward as we, as we see appropriate.", "And today we believe that particularly this very strong forward guidance \u2014very powerful forward guidance that we\u2019ve announced today will provide strong support for the economy.", "Effectively , we\u2019re saying that rates will remain highly accommodative until the economy is far along in its recovery, and that, that  should be a very powerful statement in supporting economic activity.", "Now we \u2019re buying $120 billion in securities per month across the \u2014across the  Treasury curve.", "We do have the flexibility to adjust that tool and, and the  rate tool and, and  other tools as well.", "But as for right now, we think\u2014we think  that our policy setting is appropriate to support the ex pansion.", "We  did\u2014we  said from the beginning that we would first try to provide some support and stability and relief in the first phase of the crisis, the acute phase, a nd then we would support the expansion when it came.", "And it\u2019s well a long.", "So what we said in our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals and Monetar y Policy Strategy was that the C ommittee \u2019s policy decisions reflect \u201c its longer -run goals, its medium -term outlook, and its assessment [s] of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that coul d impede the at tainment of the C ommittee \u2019s goals.\u201d   So that \u2019s what we said about financial

goals.\u201d  But you asked specifically about , about  financial stability.", "One thing I would say is that financial \u2014that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense \u2014is not the first line of defense on financial stability.", "We look to more appropria te tools in the first instance as a first line of defense , and those would be regulation, supervision, high capital, high liquidity , stress testing \u2014all of those things, macroprudential tools.", "All of those things are, are really the first line of defense o n financial stability.", "But we always leave open the idea that we will not ignore September 16, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 of 32  those kinds of risks and other kinds of risks , more broadly, that could impede the attainment of our goals in, in setting  monetary policy.", "So , you know, what we said again  in the [Statement on] L onger -Run [Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy] \u2014you know, in our consensus

goals.\u201d   So the test would be, you know, does a majority of the C ommittee feel that , that  monetary policy is , is triggering that?", "We do monitor financial stability concerns , of course , intensely and regularly.", "We try to use our other tools on them, but we , we do keep them in mind as we think about monetary policy.", "And, you know, you don\u2019t \u2014you also don \u2019t see people , by and large , lifting off or raising interest rates above zero.", "I guess there are 4 exceptions out of a Committee o f 17 during that \u2014during the forecast period .", "So we don\u2019 t reach 2  percent , but we get very close to it in the forecast.", "We reach 2  percent \u2014I guess the median is 2  percent  at the end of 2023.", "It says that we expect that the current setting of , of our r ates will be\u2014what we  expect  [is] that it will be appropriate until such time as we reach 2  percent  inflation , that we feel that labor market conditions are consistent with our assessment of maximum employment, and that we \u2019re on track to achieve inflation moderate \u2014inflation moderately above.", "You asked about confidence, and I would say that thi s, this  very strong, very powerful guidance shows both our confidence and our determination.", "It shows our confidence that we can reach this goal and our determination to do so.", "Because it \u2014we think, looking at everything we know about inflation dynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades, we expect it will take some time.", "We expect that the economy will recover quickly now, but that that pace will slow as, as people go back to work.", "And we \u2019ll still have an area of the economy \u2014a big area of the economy\u2014that struggles.", "There will be slack in the economy.", "The economy will be below September 16, 2020   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 11 of 32  maximum employment, below full demand.", "And that will tend to wear \u2014to put downward pressure on inflation.", "So we think that once we get up closer to maximum employment, we think that inflation will come back , generally.", "And , I mean, that \u2019s sort of what happened during the last long expansion.", "Inflation does move up over time.", "We do expect that will continue today, a nd we expect that our , our guidance is powerful and will help that outcome.", "We think that \u2014that  effectively saying that policy will remain highly accommodative unt il the economy is very far along in its recovery should provide strong support for the economy and get us there sooner rather than later.", "Sur e.  So, first, if you look at the Summary of Economic P rojections that my colleagues and I filed for this meeting, what you\u2019 ll see is an expectation that the recovery will continue \u2014that it will continue at a reasonable pace through 2021, \u2019 22, and \u2019 23.", "You would expect that the third quarter should be  the fastest gains, and that , after that, the pace should slow down to a more norm al pace.", "In terms of fiscal policy \u2014you asked about fiscal policy.", "So , you know, one thing\u2014 I guess I would start by saying that the initial response from fiscal authorities was rapid.", "And we \u2019re seeing the results of that in \u2014today in income and household spending data, in the labor market data, in the construction data, in the data for business equipment spending, and the fact that businesses are staying in business, and , you know, the pace of de fault and things like that has really slowed.", "That said, my sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed.", "We\u2019ve also got struggling small businesses, especially those in the business of facing directly to the public.", "And we have state and local governments dealing with a drop in revenue at the same time spending has gone up, much of it related to the pandemic and economic effects.", "So , again, I would say, the fiscal support has been essential in , in the good progress we see now.", "And, finally, I\u2019 ll note that just about all\u2014 the overwhelming majority of , of private forecasters who, who project an ongoing recovery are assuming there will be substantial additional fiscal support.", "Well, s o we think that the  forward guidance we adopted today is appropriate and, as I mentioned, powerful.", "Effectively, what it says is that we\u2019ll, we will  keep policy where it is now \u2014keep the rate policy where it is now until unemployment reaches the Committee \u2019s assessments or levels that are\u2014sorry, not unemployment , labor market conditions reach levels that are consistent with the Committee \u2019s assessments of maximum employment , until inflation reaches 2  percent , and until it \u2019s on track to go above 2 percent  moderately for some time.", "So that \u2019s very strong forward guidance, and we think that that will be durable guidance that will provide significant support to the economy in coming years.", "So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  really our thinking on, on  forward guidance on rate s.

one month of 2 percent  inflation ; we said return to 2\u2014to achieve 2 percent  inflation.", "So just understand that, you know, we \u2019re strongly committed to achieving our goals and the overshoot.", "Oh, in terms of \u2014okay, in terms of \u2014so, what does \u201c moderate \u201d mean?", "It doesn\u2019t \u2014it means not very high above 2 percent .", "It means moderate.", "In terms of \u2014in terms of  \u201cfor a time, \u201d what it means is not permanently and not for a sustained period.", "It\u2019 s actually prett y straightforward.", "We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent  over time.", "And if we do that, inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent, and that \u2019ll help us achieve 2  percent  inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its ability to support the economy.", "So , in terms of the effects, so  I think what we\u2019ve done  is\u2014is more or less aligned with the consensus statement today.", "As I mentioned, I think over time it will provide very powerful support for this economy as we move forward.", "But I think , over time, again, guidance that we expect to retain the current stance until the economy  is\u2014has moved very far toward our goals is a strong and powerful t hing.", "And I think that will be supportive of the economy over time.", "In terms of additional fiscal support, I guess your question is, what would happen if \u2014yes, so, people have different assessments, and, and different participants in the FOMC made different assessments on their own.", "I think broadly, though, there is an expectation among private forecasters and among FOMC participants that there will be some further fiscal action.", "So , so far the economy has proven resilient to

evictions and foreclosures and, and, you know, things that will scar and damage the economy.", "So that \u2019s a downside risk.", "And , you know, no one \u2014no one  has any certainty around that, but , broadly speaking, if we don\u2019 t get that, then there would certainly be downside risks through the \u2014certainly through the channel I mentioned.", "So we \u2014you know, we monitor everything we think is important in the U.S. economy.", "And  in that \u2014in a broad sense, all of it goes into thinking about monetary policy.", "So , you know, disparities in, in income and in financial well -being by various demographic and racial categories is something we monitor carefully.", "But I would point to the relative stagnation of incomes for people at the lower end of the income spectrum and also lower mobility.", "So those are things that hold back our economy.", "We, we have interest rates and bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like that , but we can\u2019t \u2014we can\u2019t  get at those things through our tools.", "When we lower the federal funds rate, that supports the economy across a broad range of , of people and activities, but we
