The fact that yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose in line with nominal counterparts indicates a balanced approach. The unchanged longer-term inflation compensation implies that the FOMC may not view inflation as a significant concern, making it irrelevant for any hawkish or dovish policy adjustments."}, {"sentence": "Risk spreads on corporate bonds were stable at  relatively low levels, consistent with favorable indicators of corporate credit quality.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the risk spreads on corporate bonds in the US are stable and at low levels, indicating a positive outlook for corporate credit quality.

The mention of M2 growing moderately indicates a moderate expansion, while the reference to rising opportunity costs associated with monetary policy tightening implies a cautious approach.

The growth of small time deposits, which are influenced by market rates, picking up indicates an increase in interest rates.
