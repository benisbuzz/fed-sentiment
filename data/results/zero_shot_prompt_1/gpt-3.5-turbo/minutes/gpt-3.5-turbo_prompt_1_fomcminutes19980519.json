However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this information is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "The one-time effects of falling oil prices, lower  food prices, and recent appreciation of the dollar on foreign-exchange  markets provided only a temporary reduction of inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the temporary reduction of inflation caused by falling oil prices, lower food prices, and the appreciation of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets is not significant enough to impact US monetary policy. Therefore, it can be considered irrelevant in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "While some  reacceleration of reported rates of inflation was probably  unavoidable, sustained rapid money growth would risk even higher  inflation in future years.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the unavoidable reacceleration of reported inflation rates but warns against sustained rapid money growth, which could lead to even higher inflation in the future."}, {"sentence": "The durability of the economic expansion  would be jeopardized by price and wage decisions reflecting  expectations that the purchasing power of the dollar would decline at  faster rates in the future.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that if price and wage decisions anticipate a faster decline in the purchasing power of the dollar, it could jeopardize the durability of the economic expansion. This indicates a concern for maintaining stability and avoiding inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Once such expectations became imbedded in  the economy, even stronger policy actions would be required in order  to reestablish a downward trend of inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that if inflation expectations become deeply rooted in the economy, more aggressive policy measures would be necessary to bring inflation back down."}, {"sentence": "It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would  be held on Tuesday, May 19, 1998.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only states the date of the next meeting of the Committee.

The decline in exports, particularly to Asia, indicates a weakening global demand, which may prompt the Federal Open Market Committee to adopt a more accommodative approach to stimulate the economy.

The fact that consumer prices were little changed in January and February, with declines in energy prices offsetting increases elsewhere, indicates that there is no significant inflationary pressure. Therefore, it is irrelevant in terms of influencing a hawkish or dovish monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "At the producer level, falling prices for finished energy  goods in January and February pulled down the index of prices for all  finished items; excluding food and energy, prices were unchanged on  balance over the two months.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of falling prices for finished energy goods indicates a potential deflationary pressure, which could be seen as dovish. However, the fact that prices were unchanged on balance over the two months, excluding food and energy, implies a more neutral outlook."}, {"sentence": "Over the twelve months ended in  February, producer price inflation was negligible.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that producer price inflation has been minimal over the past year. As it does not provide any indication of future expectations or policy implications, it is irrelevant to assessing the stance of US monetary policy as hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Tight labor  markets appeared to be putting some upward pressure on labor  compensation, but the pickup was limited.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.

The rapid expansion of M2 and M3 indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did not anticipate such growth during its February meeting. This could lead to a more accommodative stance, as the unexpected expansion may require the committee to take measures to maintain stability."}, {"sentence": "On a quarterly  average basis, growth of both monetary aggregates picked up somewhat  in the first quarter from already robust rates in the fourth quarter.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates an increase in the growth of monetary aggregates, implying a potential need for tighter monetary measures to control inflation and maintain stability."}, {"sentence": "The increased demand for M2 was perhaps associated in part with the  reduced attractiveness of longer-term fixed rate market assets, whose  yields had declined significantly relative to the returns on liquid  investment components of M2.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the increased demand for M2, which is a measure of money supply, may be influenced by the decreased appeal of longer-term fixed rate market assets. This implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy as investors are favoring more liquid and short-term investments over longer-term ones."}, {"sentence": "In addition, households might have been  trying to rebalance asset portfolios that had become more heavily  weighted in equities as a result of the run-up in stock prices.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses households' actions in rebalancing asset portfolios, which does not directly impact the decision-making process of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding interest rates or other monetary policy tools."}, {"sentence": "The  pickup in M3 growth reflected a surge in bank issuance of large time  deposits to finance strong demands for loans by businesses and  households.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

Despite the expectation of slower output growth, inflation is anticipated to increase due to tight labor markets and diminishing drag from non-oil import prices.

The mention of domestic demand exceeding expectations and likely to continue increasing rapidly implies a need for a less accommodative approach in key segments of financial markets."}, {"sentence": "Despite tightening labor markets, inflation prospects remained quite  favorable for a while as a number of factors--some temporary--helped  to damp near-term pressures on prices.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Despite tightening labor markets, the mention of favorable inflation prospects and temporary factors dampening near-term price pressures indicates a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Nonetheless, in the absence of  some slowing in the expansion, labor compensation probably would  continue to accelerate and increasingly outpace productivity, adding  to pressures on prices.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that if the expansion continues without any slowing, labor compensation will accelerate and outpace productivity, leading to increased pressures on prices.
