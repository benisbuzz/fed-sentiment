The speaker believes that if the outlooks for inflation and unemployment align with their expectations, the necessary conditions for raising interest rates will be met by year-end 2022. The mention of core PCE inflation running at 2.8 percent and projected to remain moderately above 2 percent indicates a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Moreover, my inflation projections for 2023 and 2024, which forecast inflation rates similar to the SEP medians, would by year-end 2022, to me, satisfy the \"on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time\" threshold specified in the statement.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.
