Although PCE price inflation is currently below the 2 percent objective, the FOMC expects it to gradually rise to the target with appropriate monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Although the unemployment rate is around a 50-year low, wages are rising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. Despite the low unemployment rate, the fact that wages are rising in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation indicates a balanced approach, neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "We are not seeing any evidence to date that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost-push pressure on price inflation.Although the fundamentals supporting household consumption remain solid, over 2019, sluggish growth abroad and global developments weighed on investment, exports, and manufacturing in the United States.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.

However, the sentence also mentions the FOMC's shift in policy to counter global growth headwinds and disinflationary pressures, which could indicate a more neutral stance. Overall, the implications on US monetary policy are likely to be neutral."}, {"sentence": "I believe this shift was well timed and has been providing support to the economy and helping to keep the U.S. outlook on track.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive view on the timing and effectiveness of a shift in US monetary policy.
