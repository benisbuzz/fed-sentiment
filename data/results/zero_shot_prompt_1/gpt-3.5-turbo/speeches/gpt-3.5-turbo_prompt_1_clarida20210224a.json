[{"sentence": "Vice Chair Clarida delivered identical remarks to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia's \"Live from America\" webinar series on February 24, 2021.It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today.1 I look forward to our conversation, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.Current Economic Situation and Outlook\r\nIn the second quarter of last year, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression, but economic activity rebounded sharply in the third quarter, supported by a robust and unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it provides background information on the economic situation and outlook rather than indicating any specific stance or direction."}, {"sentence": "More recently, the pace of recovery has moderated in part because of a winter resurgence in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.A number of macroeconomic data releases have been weaker than expected in recent months.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a moderated pace of recovery due to a winter resurgence in COVID-19 cases implies a need for continued support. Additionally, the weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data releases further support a dovish approach to stimulate the economy."}, {"sentence": "Spending on services has continued to remain well below pre-pandemic levels, particularly in contact-intensive sectors, including travel, leisure, and hospitality.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The ongoing low spending on services, especially in contact-intensive sectors like travel, leisure, and hospitality, indicates a weak economic recovery. This may prompt the Federal Reserve to maintain or adopt accommodative measures to stimulate growth and support these struggling sectors."}, {"sentence": "The pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed notably in recent months.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The mention of a notable slowdown in the labor market's improvement indicates a potential concern for economic growth, which could lead to a more cautious approach in implementing monetary measures."}, {"sentence": "Although more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost last spring have been regained, the unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.3 percent in January, and once one factors in the decline in the labor force since the onset of the pandemic and misclassification, the true unemployment rate is closer to 10 percent.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite the recovery of a significant number of lost jobs, the unemployment rate remains high, indicating a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of the true unemployment rate being closer to 10 percent highlights the need for continued support and stimulus measures."}, {"sentence": "Core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation is running at just 1.5 percent, and, for those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, price increases remain subdued.Of course, we have also received some encouraging data.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of Core PCE inflation running at just 1.5 percent and subdued price increases in pandemic-affected sectors indicates a lack of inflationary pressure, supporting a more accommodative approach. The mention of encouraging data could imply a neutral or slightly hawkish sentiment, but the overall focus on subdued inflation suggests a dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the housing sector, indicating a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The recovery is attributed to low mortgage interest rates, implying that the Federal Reserve may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent potential overheating in the housing market."}, {"sentence": "Business investment and manufacturing production have also rebounded robustly.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the US economy, indicating a robust rebound in business investment and manufacturing production. As a result, it implies a potentially hawkish stance on US monetary policy, as the strong economic indicators may lead to a more aggressive approach in tightening monetary measures."}, {"sentence": "And while the economy might not continue to grow at the once-in-a-century 33 percent annualized rate of growth reported in the third quarter of 2020, it is clear that the economy has turned out to be more resilient in adapting to the virus, and more responsive to monetary and fiscal policy support, than many predicted.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the US economy has shown resilience and adaptability to the virus, as well as responsiveness to monetary and fiscal policy support. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it does not explicitly indicate a shift towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Indeed, it is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) presented in the latest Summary of Economic Projections, released last December, most of my colleagues and I revised up our outlooks for the economy over the medium term, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2 In particular, the median FOMC participant projected in December that by the end of 2023\u00e2\u0080\u0094a little less than three years from now\u00e2\u0080\u0094the unemployment rate will have fallen below 4 percent, and PCE inflation will have returned to 2 percent.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC participants have revised up their outlooks for the economy, projecting a relatively rapid return to employment and inflation levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate. This indicates a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy in the future."}, {"sentence": "Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.While the winter surge in new COVID cases and the spread of new variants of the virus are cause for concern as well as a source of downside risk to the very near-term outlook, the welcome news on the development of several effective vaccines and the passage by the Congress in late December of a package of fiscal relief measures indicate to me that the prospects for the economy in 2021 and beyond have brightened and the downside risk to the outlook has diminished.Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework \r\nAt our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy. It discusses the recent FOMC decisions and the new monetary policy framework, but does not provide any implications or indications of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "As announced in the September statement and reiterated in the following statements, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.3 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as our maximum-employment mandate\u00e2\u0080\u0094are achieved.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC aims to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, indicating a willingness to maintain an accommodative stance until both inflation and maximum employment goals are achieved."}, {"sentence": "We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.In addition, in the December statement, we combined our forward guidance for the federal funds rate with enhanced, outcome-based guidance about our asset purchases.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) intends to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until specific labor market conditions are met and inflation reaches 2 percent. The inclusion of enhanced, outcome-based guidance for asset purchases further emphasizes a dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.The changes to the policy statement that we made over the past few FOMC meetings bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August.4 In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of \"shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094not \"deviations.\"", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The indication to continue increasing holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities until substantial further progress is made towards employment and price stability goals aligns with the Committee's new framework. The emphasis on \"shortfalls\" of employment indicates a focus on achieving maximum employment, which implies a more accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that a low unemployment rate alone will not lead to a tightening of monetary policy unless there is evidence of inflationary risks from other indicators."}, {"sentence": "With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the challenge\u00e2\u0080\u0094of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC acknowledges the challenge of maintaining inflation expectations at 2 percent due to the effective-lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate during downturns. This implies a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it \"seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,\" and\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the same sentence\u00e2\u0080\u0094that therefore \"following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\"", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC aims to anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent and is willing to tolerate inflation moderately above 2 percent for a period after persistent inflation below 2 percent. This indicates a willingness to support accommodative monetary policy to stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from \"flexible inflation targeting\" to \"flexible average inflation targeting.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the US monetary policy is shifting from a \"flexible inflation targeting\" approach to a \"flexible average inflation targeting\" framework. This indicates a dovish stance as it implies a willingness to tolerate higher inflation temporarily to achieve long-term average inflation targets."}, {"sentence": "\"5 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0094maximum employment and price stability\u00e2\u0080\u0094which remain unchanged.6Concluding Remarks\r\nWhile our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevailed at the business cycle peak reached last February.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current monetary policy strategy is in line with the dual-mandate goals of the Federal Reserve, which are maximum employment and price stability. It acknowledges the support provided by interest rate and balance sheet tools, but also highlights the need for time to fully recover economic activity and employment. The sentence is neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help ensure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust and rapid as possible.\u00a01.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the commitment to using all available tools to support the economy and promote a strong and rapid recovery from the challenging period."}, {"sentence": "The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee participants.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it simply states that the views expressed are personal and may not align with other members of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."}, {"sentence": "The most recent Summary of Economic Projections is available on the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides a link to access the most recent Summary of Economic Projections on the Board's website. It does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of monetary policy, whether hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "The statements issued following the September and subsequent FOMC meetings are available, along with other postmeeting statements, on the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about the availability of FOMC meeting statements on the Board's website. It does not indicate any hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The statement is available on the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to the implications of US monetary policy as it only provides a link to the Federal Reserve's website where the statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy can be found."}, {"sentence": "See Jerome H. Powell (2020), \"New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,\" speech delivered at \"Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for Monetary Policy,\" a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about a speech delivered by Jerome H. Powell at a symposium. It does not indicate any hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "See Richard H. Clarida (2020), \"The Federal Reserve's New Monetary Policy Framework: A Robust Evolution,\" speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington (via webcast), August 31; and Richard H.

Clarida discussing the Federal Reserve's new monetary policy framework. It does not provide any direct implications or insights on whether the policy is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}]
