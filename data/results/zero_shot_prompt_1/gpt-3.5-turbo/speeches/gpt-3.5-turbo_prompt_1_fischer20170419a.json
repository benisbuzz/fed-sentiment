[{"sentence": "In my remarks, I will discuss how U.S. monetary policy actions affect our foreign trading partners, with particular focus on how foreign economies have responded to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) ongoing normalization of policy rates.1Spillovers from the Fed's Unconventional Policies\r\nExtensive empirical research on spillovers--including by Federal Reserve and International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff members--indicates that spillovers from the actions of major central banks occur through several important channels.2 While the exchange rate is a key channel of transmission and gets a great deal of attention in the public debate about monetary spillovers, it is not the only channel.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it focuses on the spillovers from the actions of major central banks and the channels of transmission, rather than directly addressing the stance of US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "U.S. monetary policy also affects foreign economies by influencing U.S. domestic demand and by affecting global financial conditions.My reading of the evidence is that the Fed's highly accommodative monetary policy during the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath probably raised foreign gross domestic product (GDP) overall.3 While U.S. monetary easing caused the dollar to depreciate, which reduced foreign GDP by shifting demand toward cheaper U.S. goods, foreign economies benefited from a stronger expansion in U.S. domestic demand.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the impact of U.S. monetary policy on foreign economies is not irrelevant. The evidence indicates that the Fed's accommodative monetary policy during the Global Financial Crisis likely boosted foreign GDP. Although U.S. monetary easing led to a depreciation of the dollar and reduced foreign GDP through increased demand for cheaper U.S. goods, the overall benefit came from a stronger expansion in U.S. domestic demand. Therefore, this sentence implies a neutral stance on U.S. monetary policy's implications for foreign economies."}, {"sentence": "Moreover, U.S. monetary easing also stimulated foreign GDP by depressing foreign bond yields and raising the prices of risky assets.Of course, there were considerable differences in how foreign economies were affected by the Fed's policies.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that U.S. monetary easing had a positive impact on foreign GDP through the manipulation of foreign bond yields and risky asset prices. However, it also acknowledges that the effects varied across different foreign economies. In terms of US monetary policy, this sentence is irrelevant as it does not directly address the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or its implications on domestic monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Because the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) also experienced slow growth after the financial crisis, their central banks adopted similar policies.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the US monetary policy may have been influenced by the actions of central banks in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) due to their similar policies in response to slow growth after the financial crisis. However, it does not provide a clear indication of whether the US monetary policy is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "By contrast, the Fed's accommodative policies put further upward pressure on asset prices and currencies in some emerging market economies (EMEs) that were already experiencing rapid output growth.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the Fed's accommodative policies have a hawkish effect on asset prices and currencies in certain emerging market economies. It implies that the Fed's actions may contribute to increased inflationary pressures in these economies, which could potentially impact US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Thus, EME central banks had to navigate between tightening policy more--and hurting exports through a bigger exchange rate appreciation--and maintaining an accommodative stance closer to the Fed's, but with a higher risk of overheating.4 These tradeoffs faced by EME central banks underscore some of the challenges posed by monetary policy divergence with the United States--a tradeoff with which I am personally very familiar.Spillovers from Recent Policy Tightening\r\nMonetary policy divergence remains a familiar theme today, but the focus has obviously shifted to the consequences of tighter U.S. monetary policy for the global economy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence highlights the challenges faced by EME central banks in navigating between tightening policy and maintaining an accommodative stance. It implies that the consequences of tighter US monetary policy for the global economy are relevant and may have implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Policy divergence is an ongoing concern given that most AFEs and many EMEs have continued to pursue highly accommodative monetary policies that remain appropriate in light of their weaker cyclical positions and subdued levels of underlying inflation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the concern of policy divergence remains, as most Advanced Foreign Economies (AFEs) and Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) continue to pursue accommodative monetary policies. This indicates a dovish stance, as these policies are considered appropriate due to weaker cyclical positions and low levels of inflation."}, {"sentence": "Many observers point to the \"taper tantrum\" in 2013 as illustrating how monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve can potentially have strong contractionary effects on foreign financial conditions.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence highlights the potential contractionary effects of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve on foreign financial conditions, specifically referring to the \"taper tantrum\" in 2013. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it emphasizes the importance of considering the impact on global markets. However, it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "Subsequently, the expectation that a steadily improving U.S. labor market would call for tighter U.S. monetary policy--and hence imply greater monetary divergence with our trading partners--helped drive a sharp appreciation of the dollar between the middle of 2014 and the end of last year that was accompanied by capital outflows from many EMEs.Against this backdrop and the concerns it raises, the reaction in financial markets to the FOMC's decisions to increase the target range for the federal funds rate following its December 2016 and March 2017 meetings--by a cumulative total of 50 basis points--seems benign.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the sharp appreciation of the dollar and capital outflows from many emerging market economies (EMEs) were driven by the expectation of tighter US monetary policy. However, the reaction in financial markets to the FOMC's decisions to increase the federal funds rate seems benign, indicating a neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The yields on risky foreign bonds, especially in EMEs, have continued to decline to below historical norms, and global stock prices have risen.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The decline in yields on risky foreign bonds and the rise in global stock prices indicate a favorable economic environment, reducing the need for aggressive monetary measures."}, {"sentence": "The dollar has depreciated since mid-December, especially against EMEs, and the EMEs have experienced capital inflows.In my view, this favorable reaction partly reflects a view by market participants that the rate hikes are a signal of the FOMC's confidence in the underlying prospects for the U.S. economy that in turn has increased confidence in the global outlook: A strong U.S. economy is a major plus for the global economy.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The depreciation of the dollar and capital inflows in emerging market economies indicate that market participants view the rate hikes as a signal of the FOMC's confidence in the US economy. This increased confidence in the global outlook implies that a strong US economy is beneficial for the global economy."}, {"sentence": "But the main reason for the positive market reaction is that foreign output expansions appear more entrenched, and downside risks to those economies noticeably smaller than in recent years.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on foreign economies, indicating a potential shift towards a more hawkish stance in US monetary policy. The reduced downside risks and entrenched output expansions abroad may influence the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary measures."}, {"sentence": "In Europe, unemployment has fallen steadily; inflation and inflation expectations are moving toward central bank targets; and, while Brexit entails many unknowns, so far it has not resulted in significant financial market disruptions.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on Europe's economic conditions, with decreasing unemployment and inflation moving towards central bank targets. The mention of Brexit not causing significant financial market disruptions implies a neutral stance on its impact. Overall, this sentence is dovish as it indicates favorable economic trends and stability in Europe, which could influence a more accommodative US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "China's economy also appears to be on a more solid footing, which has helped stabilize the renminbi as well as support growth in other EMEs.The IMF staff has taken these developments into account in the April 2017 World Economic Outlook (WEO) and forecasts that world GDP growth will be noticeably higher over the next two years than in 2016--a slight upward revision relative to the October 2016 WEO.5 There may well even be some chance that foreign economies kick into gear enough that U.S. and foreign business conditions become reasonably well aligned, as occurred during the U.S. monetary tightening cycles that began in 1999 and in 2004.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the potential impact of foreign economies on US business conditions. It does not provide any indication of whether the Federal Reserve will adopt a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "In both of those episodes, U.S. exports grew substantially against the backdrop of a brisk expansion in foreign activity and a stable or even slightly depreciating dollar.Of course, it is hard to predict whether foreign economies continue to strengthen so that the global economy will move more in sync--as I hope--or if a substantial gap will remain between the business cycle positions of the United States and our foreign trading partners.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the positive impact of a strong foreign economy on US exports, but also highlights the uncertainty of whether this synchronization will continue. The mention of a \"substantial gap\" implies that the FOMC is cautious about potential divergences in business cycle positions, which could influence their policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "However, even if monetary policy divergence remains substantial, there is good reason to think that spillovers to foreign economies will be manageable.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the substantial divergence in monetary policy but implies that the spillovers to foreign economies will not have significant implications. Therefore, it is irrelevant to the US monetary policy outlook."}, {"sentence": "First, I expect that the Fed's removal of accommodation will be driven by a continued expansion of the U.S. economy; thus, foreign economies are likely to benefit from the developments that induce the FOMC to tighten.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the Federal Reserve will remove accommodation due to the expansion of the US economy, which may have positive effects on foreign economies as the FOMC tightens its policies."}, {"sentence": "Second, most foreign central banks should be able to mitigate an undesirable tightening of their own financial conditions through appropriate policy actions.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that foreign central banks have the ability to counteract any negative impact on their financial conditions, implying a neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "An important lesson of the taper tantrum was that effective communication and actions by major central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, were helpful in quickly pushing bond yields down to levels that these central banks regarded as appropriate to their economic situation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that effective communication and actions by major central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, played a crucial role in quickly reducing bond yields to levels deemed appropriate. However, it does not directly indicate a specific stance on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant to determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Third, many EMEs have markedly improved fundamentals--including smaller current account deficits and more anchored inflation expectations--that should allow them to better withstand the effects of U.S. tightening, though some vulnerabilities remain.Finally, I expect that U.S. policy normalization will be gradual under likely scenarios for the evolution of output and inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the improved fundamentals of many emerging market economies (EMEs) which should help them withstand the effects of US tightening. Additionally, it expects a gradual policy normalization in the US based on likely scenarios for output and inflation."}, {"sentence": "A gradual and ongoing removal of accommodation seems likely both to maximize the prospects of a continued expansion in the U.S. economy and to mitigate the risk of undesirable spillovers abroad.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"removal of accommodation\" implies a gradual tightening of monetary policy to prevent potential negative effects on the US economy and minimize spillovers abroad."}, {"sentence": "\"International Spillovers of Monetary Policy,\" IFDP Notes.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence, \"International Spillovers of Monetary Policy,\" IFDP Notes, is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance.
