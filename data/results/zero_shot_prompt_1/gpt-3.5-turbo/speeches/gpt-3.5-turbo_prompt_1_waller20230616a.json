It implies a dovish stance, as the Fed may prioritize addressing financial instability to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "This is in large part why the Federal Reserve monitors financial stability risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094to help ensure that banks, nonbank financial institutions, and financial markets can continue channeling credit to households and businesses.But this is a two-way street.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy.

However, it also emphasizes that the tools used to address financial stability are separate from those used for monetary policy.
