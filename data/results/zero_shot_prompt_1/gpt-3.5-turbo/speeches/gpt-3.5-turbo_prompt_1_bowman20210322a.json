The expectation of firms operating at reduced capacity for an extended period and needing financial assistance indicates a weaker economic outlook, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to maintain or implement accommodative measures to support the economy."}, {"sentence": "While obviously not conclusive, the visible relationship between state-level economic restrictions and small business damage is both striking and concerning.You may be tempted to ask why I am so focused on small businesses.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the relationship between state-level economic restrictions and small business damage, without directly addressing the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or its implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "For one, it is because the roughly 32 million small businesses in the United States comprise an important source of job growth in the macroeconomy, and they have an outsized impact on their local communities.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it focuses on the importance of small businesses in job growth and local communities, without providing any indication of the stance (hawkish, dovish, or neutral) towards monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Over the past decade, small businesses created 10.5 million net new jobs, accounting for roughly two-thirds of overall net new job creation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it focuses on the role of small businesses in job creation over the past decade.

The speaker acknowledges the expectation of inflation due to a stronger economy but emphasizes that pricing pressures are not expected to be excessive.
