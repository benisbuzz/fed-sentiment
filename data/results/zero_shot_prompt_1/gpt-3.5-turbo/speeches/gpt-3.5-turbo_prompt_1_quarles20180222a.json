[{"sentence": "I am very happy to be participating in this symposium on taking stock of the global economy a decade after the Global Financial Crisis, and I thank Hiroshi Watanabe for the invitation.1 I have been asked to provide an overview of the U.S. economy since the advent of the crisis in no longer than 10 minutes, so I could either talk very quickly or focus my comments on more recent developments, perhaps throwing in a bit of historical context when appropriate.To cut to the bottom line, the U.S. economy appears to be performing very well and, certainly, is in the best shape that it has been in since the crisis and, by many metrics, since well before the crisis.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or assessment of the current or future stance of monetary policy. It primarily focuses on the speaker's participation in a symposium and their overview of the US economy."}, {"sentence": "Recent volatility in equity markets is a reminder that asset prices can move rapidly and unexpectedly.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence is neutral in terms of US monetary policy. It acknowledges the recent volatility in equity markets and highlights the potential for rapid and unexpected movements in asset prices. However, it does not provide any indication of a specific stance or action by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), making it irrelevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "However, it is my assessment that the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound and much improved relative to earlier in the decade.One easy and important place to see that improvement is in the labor market.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy\" being sound and improved implies a positive outlook. Additionally, highlighting the improvement in the labor market indicates a positive sentiment, reinforcing the hawkish stance."}, {"sentence": "After peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, the unemployment rate fell rather steadily to 4.1 percent in January--the lowest level, outside of a period from 1999 to 2000, since the 1960s.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides historical data on the unemployment rate. It does not indicate any current or future stance on monetary policy, making it unrelated to the terms hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Job gains in recent months have continued at a pace that would be pushing the unemployment rate even lower if the labor participation rate had not stabilized in recent years, a welcome development and a sign that the strength of the labor market is pulling in or retaining workers who might otherwise be on the sidelines.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of job gains and the stabilization of the labor participation rate indicate a positive development in the labor market. It implies that the strength of the labor market is attracting or keeping workers, which is favorable for the economy."}, {"sentence": "Broader measures of labor market slack--for example, those that include individuals who are out of the labor force but say they want a job as well as those working with a part-time job but who would like to work full time--have largely returned to pre-crisis levels.While the labor market has shown steady improvement over the past decade, the post-crisis performance of gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been more disappointing, averaging just 2 percent per year over the past seven years.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the broader measures of labor market slack have improved significantly, indicating a tightening labor market. However, it also highlights the disappointing post-crisis GDP growth. While the sentence does not explicitly mention monetary policy, it implies a neutral stance as it provides information on both positive and negative aspects of the economy."}, {"sentence": "However, beginning with the second quarter of last year, growth has shown some momentum.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the US economy has experienced an increase in growth since the second quarter of the previous year. While it provides insight into the state of the economy, it is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not indicate a specific stance such as hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Over the past three quarters of 2017, real GDP increased at an average rate of almost 3 percent.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about the past performance of the real GDP. It does not indicate any specific stance or implications on monetary policy, making it unrelated to the terms hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "While headline growth stepped back a bit in the fourth quarter, largely on account of increased drag from higher imports and lower inventories, underlying final private domestic demand--which is a better indicator of economic momentum--grew at its fastest pace in more than three years.Recent survey data reveal a growing sense of economic optimism.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of underlying final private domestic demand growing at its fastest pace in more than three years indicates a strong economic momentum. Additionally, the reference to a growing sense of economic optimism from recent survey data further supports a hawkish outlook."}, {"sentence": "Consumer confidence has returned to pre-crisis levels.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of whether the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would adopt a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. Consumer confidence levels alone do not directly influence monetary policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "Business optimism is also apparent in survey data as well as in the strength of investment.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the economy, indicating a potentially hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of business optimism and strength of investment implies a favorable economic environment, which may lead to a more aggressive approach in monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In 2017, investment in capital equipment increased at the fastest pace since 2011, accelerating through the year to a double-digit rate in the second half.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it solely provides information about the pace of investment in capital equipment in 2017.

However, it also highlights the concern of lagging productivity growth, which is a common issue in advanced economies. Overall, the sentence implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Beginning in 2011, the annual growth rate of labor productivity has averaged only 3/4 percent, compared with an average 2-1/4 percent pace in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the recent annual growth rate of labor productivity has been significantly lower compared to the two decades before the financial crisis. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it indicates a potential concern for economic growth, which could influence a more dovish stance by the Federal Reserve."}, {"sentence": "Why productivity growth has been so weak defies easy explanation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the perplexing issue of weak productivity growth, which does not directly impact the decision-making process of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding interest rates or other monetary policy tools."}, {"sentence": "The weak pace of business investment is likely part of the story.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The acknowledgment of weak business investment implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may consider implementing accommodative measures to stimulate economic growth and investment, indicating a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In addition, some have argued that there has been a decline in business dynamism following the crisis; others do not link the slowdown to the crisis but rather to an exogenous slowdown in the rate of technological progress; and still others believe that productivity growth has not really slowed much at all and, instead, is just not being measured correctly in the official statistics.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses different perspectives on the decline in business dynamism, the slowdown in technological progress, and the measurement of productivity growth. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Regardless, given the importance of productivity growth for the long-run potential of the economy and living standards, it is vitally important that policymakers pursue policies aimed at boosting the growth rate of productivity.Another aspect of the economy that has attracted a lot of attention is the apparent low level of inflation despite the tightness in labor markets.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence is neutral as it discusses the importance of productivity growth and policymakers' efforts to boost it. It also mentions the low level of inflation despite tight labor markets, which is irrelevant to the sentence's focus on US monetary policy implications."}, {"sentence": "The 12-month increase in headline PCE prices was 1.7 percent in December, a touch below the Fed's 2 percent objective.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it highlights that the 12-month increase in headline PCE prices was below the Fed's 2 percent objective. This indicates that there may be room for the Fed to maintain or adopt a more accommodative stance to stimulate inflation."}, {"sentence": "After assessing the recent data, my take is that the current shortfall in inflation from target as most likely due to transitory factors that will fade through 2018, pushing inflation back up to target.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker believes that the current shortfall in inflation is temporary and will fade by 2018, indicating that they are not in favor of raising interest rates in the near future."}, {"sentence": "Suffice to say, a deviation from our target of a few tenths of 1 percentage point, especially one I expect to fade, does not cause me great concern.Against this economic backdrop, with a strong labor market and likely only temporary softness in inflation, I view it as appropriate that monetary policy should continue to be gradually normalized.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges a slight deviation from the target inflation rate but expects it to fade, indicating a lack of concern. With a strong labor market and temporary inflation softness, the speaker believes it is appropriate to continue gradually normalizing monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "An important component of this normalization was initiated in October, when we started to gradually scale back our reinvestment of proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency securities.With the balance sheet normalization plan set to remain on autopilot, barring a material deterioration in the economic outlook, the federal funds rate remains our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of scaling back reinvestment and the commitment to keeping the balance sheet normalization plan on autopilot indicate a tightening approach. The focus on the federal funds rate as the primary tool for adjusting policy stance reinforces this hawkish stance."}, {"sentence": "At our January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate between 1-1/4 percent and 1-1/2 percent.2 In this range, monetary policy remains accommodative.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC has decided to keep the federal funds rate unchanged, indicating a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The statement also mentions that monetary policy remains accommodative within the given range, further supporting the neutral outlook."}, {"sentence": "I anticipate further gradual increases in the policy rate will be appropriate to both sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent objective.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker anticipates gradual increases in the policy rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around the 2 percent objective, indicating a willingness to tighten monetary policy to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "Of course, it should go without saying that I will keep a close eye on economic indicators--and their implications for the outlook for inflation and real activity\u00e2\u0080\u0091\u00e2\u0080\u0091and adjust my views on appropriate monetary policy accordingly.I would like to wrap up with a word on the financial sector.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker will closely monitor economic indicators and adjust their views on monetary policy accordingly. It implies a neutral stance, as it emphasizes the need for vigilance and flexibility in response to inflation and real activity, rather than leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach. The mention of the financial sector is irrelevant to the implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The Federal Reserve and our colleagues at other agencies have now spent the better part of the past decade building out and standing up the post-crisis regulatory regime.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the efforts made by the Federal Reserve and other agencies in building and implementing the post-crisis regulatory regime, which does not directly relate to the stance of monetary policy being hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it clarifies that the views expressed are personal and do not represent the official stance of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."}, {"sentence": "See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), \"Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,\" press release, January 31, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180131a.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "I apologize, but I am unable to access external links or specific sources.
