[{"sentence": "It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of International Finance (IIF) Washington Policy Summit.1 I regret that we are not doing this session in person, but I do hope next time we will be gathering together in Washington.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Reserve. It primarily focuses on the speaker's regret about not meeting in person and expressing hope for future gatherings."}, {"sentence": "I look forward, as always, to a conversation with my good friend and one-time colleague Tim Adams, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.Current Economic Situation and Outlook\r\nIn the second quarter of last year, the COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it primarily discusses the current economic situation and outlook, without providing any indication of the stance or direction of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Gross domestic product (GDP) collapsed at a roughly 31.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2020, more than 22 million jobs were lost in March and April, and the unemployment rate rose from a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February to almost 15 percent in April.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence highlights the severe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the US economy, with a significant decline in GDP and a sharp increase in unemployment. Given the context, it is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it reflects past events rather than providing guidance on future policy actions."}, {"sentence": "Since then, economic activity has rebounded, and it is clear that the economy has proven to be much more resilient than many forecast or feared one year ago.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the US economy, indicating a rebound in economic activity and resilience. It implies a more hawkish stance as it highlights the economy's strength, which could potentially lead to a less accommodative monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "GDP grew by almost 8 percent at an annual rate in the second half of last year, and private forecasters project that GDP will grow roughly 6 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094and possibly 7 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094this year.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a strong economic growth with GDP growing at a high rate. The projection of GDP growth for this year indicates a continuation of this positive trend. These optimistic figures could be seen as hawkish, indicating a potential need for a more restrictive monetary policy to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "As shown in the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' projections for 2021 GDP growth is 6.5 percent.2 If these projections are realized, GDP will grow at the fastest four-quarter pace since 1984.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The projection of 6.5 percent GDP growth for 2021 suggests a strong economic expansion, potentially leading to a faster pace of monetary tightening by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."}, {"sentence": "And, as this is a virtual meeting of the IIF, I would be remiss if I did not highlight that if these projections for U.S. economic activity are realized, rising U.S. imports will serve as an important source of external demand to the rest of the world this year and beyond.As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have recently improved.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the potential impact of rising US imports on external demand and the recent improvement in the labor market conditions. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Employment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about two-thirds of the jobs that were lost in December and January.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence indicates a positive development in the employment sector, with a significant increase of 379,000 jobs in February. The recovery of two-thirds of the jobs lost in the leisure and hospitality sector suggests a potential boost to consumer spending. However, without further context, it is irrelevant to determine its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Nonetheless, employment is still 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level for the economy as a whole.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence indicates that despite some improvements in employment, there is still a significant gap from the pre-pandemic level. It is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any direct indication of the stance being hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "The unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.2 percent in February, and once one factors in the decline in the labor force since the onset of the pandemic and the misclassification of some workers on temporary layoff as employed, the true unemployment rate is closer to 10 percent.It is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the FOMC presented in the latest SEP released last week, my colleagues and I substantially revised up our outlook for the economy, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The acknowledgment of the elevated unemployment rate and the misclassification of workers implies a need for continued support. Additionally, the projection of a rapid return to employment and inflation aligns with a dovish approach of maintaining accommodative measures."}, {"sentence": "In particular, the median FOMC participant now projects the unemployment rate to reach 4.5 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.With regards to inflation, the median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up to 2.1 percent in 2023.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The projected decline in the unemployment rate suggests a tightening labor market, which may lead to potential inflationary pressures. Additionally, the projected inflation rates remaining above the 2 percent target indicate a need for policy measures to prevent overheating, making it less likely for the Federal Reserve to adopt a dovish or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "Over the next few months, 12-month measures of inflation are expected to move temporarily above our 2 percent longer-run goal, owing to a run of year-over-year comparisons with depressed service-sector prices recorded in the spring of 2020 and supply bottlenecks limiting how quickly production can respond in the near term.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The expectation of temporarily higher inflation above the 2 percent goal is attributed to specific factors such as depressed service-sector prices and supply bottlenecks. This indicates a willingness to tolerate inflationary pressures as transitory, implying a neutral or accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "However, I expect most of this increase to be transitory and for inflation to return to\u00e2\u0080\u0094or perhaps run somewhat above\u00e2\u0080\u0094our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2022 and 2023.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The expectation of inflation returning to or slightly above the 2 percent goal in the longer run indicates a balanced approach, neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework we adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 FOMC meeting.3 In our new framework, we aim for inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the outcome mentioned aligns with the new framework adopted by the FOMC in August 2020. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it aims to maintain inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, without indicating any hawkish or dovish bias."}, {"sentence": "This means that following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0094as has been the case for most of the past decade\u00e2\u0080\u0094monetary policy will aim for inflation to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the Federal Reserve aims to allow inflation to moderately exceed 2 percent for a period of time, in order to compensate for previous periods of inflation running below 2 percent."}, {"sentence": "And this brings me to the next topic.Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework \r\nAt our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any specific information about the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). It simply introduces the topic of recent FOMC decisions and the new monetary policy framework without indicating whether it is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "As announced in the September statement and reiterated in the following statements, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.4 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as our maximum-employment mandate\u00e2\u0080\u0094are achieved.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC aims to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, indicating a willingness to maintain an accommodative stance until both inflation and maximum employment goals are achieved."}, {"sentence": "We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.In addition, in our December FOMC statement, the Committee combined our forward guidance for the federal funds rate with enhanced, outcome-based guidance about our asset purchases.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) intends to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until specific labor market conditions are met and inflation reaches 2 percent. The mention of enhanced, outcome-based guidance for asset purchases further emphasizes a dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.The changes to the policy statement that we made over the past few FOMC meetings bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The indication to continue increasing holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities until substantial further progress is made towards employment and price stability goals aligns with the accommodative approach outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."}, {"sentence": "In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of \"shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094not \"deviations.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish shift in US monetary policy. The emphasis on \"shortfalls\" instead of \"deviations\" indicates a focus on achieving maximum employment, implying a more accommodative stance."}, {"sentence": "\"5 This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that a low unemployment rate alone will not lead to a tightening of monetary policy unless there is evidence of inflationary pressure. Therefore, the focus is on maintaining price stability rather than solely targeting low unemployment."}, {"sentence": "With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the challenge\u00e2\u0080\u0094of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC acknowledges the challenge of maintaining inflation expectations at 2 percent due to the effective-lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate during downturns. This implies a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the Committee's commitment to achieving inflation outcomes that anchor long-run inflation expectations at the 2 percent goal."}, {"sentence": "As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from \"flexible inflation targeting\" to \"flexible average inflation targeting.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the US monetary policy is shifting from a \"flexible inflation targeting\" approach to a \"flexible average inflation targeting\" framework. This indicates a dovish stance as it implies a willingness to tolerate higher inflation temporarily to achieve long-term average inflation targets."}, {"sentence": "\"6 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0094maximum employment and price stability\u00e2\u0080\u0094that remain unchanged.7Concluding Remarks\r\nWhile our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevailed at the business cycle peak reached last February.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current monetary policy strategy is in line with the dual-mandate goals of the Federal Reserve, indicating a neutral stance. It acknowledges the support provided by interest rate and balance sheet tools, but also highlights the need for time to fully recover, which is irrelevant to immediate policy implications."}, {"sentence": "We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy until the job is well and truly done to help ensure that the economic recovery will be as robust and rapid as possible.1.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy.
