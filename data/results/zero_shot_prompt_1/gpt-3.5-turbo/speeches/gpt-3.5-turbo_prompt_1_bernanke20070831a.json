The sharp decline in issuance of securities backed by alt-A and prime jumbo mortgages, along with the cancellation of adjustable-rate subprime lending programs, indicates that investors are concerned about higher-than-expected losses. This cautious approach by lenders may lead to a more conservative monetary policy stance."}, {"sentence": "A number of others that specialize in nontraditional mortgages have been forced by funding pressures to scale back or close down.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that certain lenders focusing on nontraditional mortgages are facing funding pressures, leading them to reduce their operations or shut down.
