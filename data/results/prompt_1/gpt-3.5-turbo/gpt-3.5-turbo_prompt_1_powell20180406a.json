It simply states the general objective of fostering a strong economy for the benefit of individuals, families, and businesses."}, {"sentence": "In pursuit of that overarching objective, t he Congress has assigned us the goal s of achieving maximum employment and stable prices, known as the dual mandate .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence highlights the dual mandate assigned to the Congress, which includes achieving maximum employment and stable prices. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it emphasizes the importance of these goals. However, it does not provide any indication of a specific stance or direction, making it neutral in terms of its implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Today I will review recent economic developments , focusing on the labor market and inflation, and  then touch briefly on longer -term growth prospects .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker will discuss recent economic developments, particularly the labor market and inflation, and briefly mention longer-term growth prospects. It does not provide any indication of a specific stance on US monetary policy, therefore it is irrelevant to determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "I will finish with a disc ussion of monetary policy.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only indicates the speaker's intention to conclude with a discussion of monetary policy, without providing any indication of whether the stance will be hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Recent Developments and the State of the Economy  After what at times has been a slow recovery from the financial crisis and the Great Recession, growth has picked up.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the recent developments in the US economy have led to an improvement in growth after a slow recovery from the financial crisis and the Great Recession. It implies a more positive outlook, which could be seen as a dovish signal for US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent at its peak in Oc tober 2009 to 4.1 percent, the lowest level in nearly two decades (figure 1).", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a positive trend in the US labor market, with a significant decrease in unemployment rate. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it suggests a potential shift towards a more hawkish stance, as a low unemployment rate may lead to concerns about inflationary pressures and the need for tighter monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Seventeen million jobs have been created in this expansion, and the monthly pace of job growth remains more than sufficient to employ  new entrants to the labor force (figure 2).", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the US economy, indicating a hawkish stance on monetary policy. The strong job growth and creation of seventeen million jobs during this expansion imply that the Federal Reserve may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "The labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) expect it to remain strong.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC expects the labor market to remain strong, indicating a positive outlook on the economy. This implies a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Inflation has continued to run below the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective but we expect it to move up in coming months and to stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Despite inflation running below the FOMC's target, the expectation is for it to increase in the future and stabilize around the desired 2 percent level. This indicates a willingness to maintain a neutral stance and potentially implement accommodative measures if needed."}, {"sentence": "Beyond the labor market, there are other signs of economic strength.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that besides the strong labor market, there are additional indicators of economic strength. Although it does not explicitly mention monetary policy, it implies a positive outlook, which could be seen as hawkish or supportive of maintaining the current policy stance."}, {"sentence": "Steady income gains, rising household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence continue to support consumer spending, which accounts for  about two thirds of economic output.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the US economy, indicating a potentially hawkish stance on monetary policy. The steady income gains, rising household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence are likely to encourage consumer spending, which is crucial for economic growth."}, {"sentence": "- 2 - Business investment improved markedly last year following two subpar years, and both business surveys and profit expectations point to further gains ahead.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the US economy, indicating a hawkish stance on monetary policy.

The mention of fiscal stimulus and accommodative financial conditions supporting household spending and business investment indicates a supportive approach. Additionally, the reference to strong global growth boosting US exports implies a positive outlook."}, {"sentence": "As many of you know, each quarter FOMC participants --the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Bank s--submit  their individual projections for growth, unemployment, and inflation, as well as their forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, which the Committee uses as the primary tool of monetary policy.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence indicates that FOMC participants submit their projections and forecasts for various economic factors, including the federal funds rate. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it highlights the importance of these projections in determining the appropriate path of the rate. However, it does not provide any indication of whether the projections are hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "These individual projections are compiled and published in the Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP.  FOMC participants  submitted their most recent forecasts t hree weeks ago, and those forecasts show a strengthening in the medium -term economic outlook (table 1).", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about the process of compiling and publishing individual projections. It does not indicate whether the projections are hawkish, dovish, or neutral, and does not provide any insight into the future direction of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "As you can see, participants g enerally raised their forecasts for growth in inflation -adjusted gross domestic product  (GDP) and lowered their forecasts for unemployment.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The fact that participants raised their forecasts for growth in inflation-adjusted GDP and lowered their forecasts for unemployment indicates an expectation of stronger economic conditions. This could imply a potential shift towards tighter monetary policy to prevent overheating, making it relevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In addition, many participants expressed  increased confidence that inflation would move up toward our 2 percent target.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates that many participants have gained confidence in inflation moving towards the 2 percent target. This implies a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding the target."}, {"sentence": "The  FOMC sees  the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC views the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, indicating that they do not lean towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "The State of the Labor Market  As I mentioned, the headline unemployment rate has declined to levels not seen since 2000.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the state of the labor market, indicating a potentially hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The decline in the headline unemployment rate to levels not seen since 2000 implies a strong job market, which may lead to a more aggressive approach in tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The median projection in the March SEP calls for unemployment to fall well below 4 percent  for a sustained period, something that has not happened since the late 1960s.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

It states that the level of maximum employment is not influenced by monetary policy, but rather by labor market factors. Additionally, it highlights that maximum employment is not directly measurable and is subject to change over time."}, {"sentence": "Real -time estimates of maximum employment are highly uncertain.2  Recognizing this uncertainty, the FOMC does not set a fixed goal for maximum employment.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC acknowledges the high uncertainty in real-time estimates of maximum employment and therefore does not establish a specific target for it. This approach indicates a cautious and flexible approach, which is neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "Instead, we look at  a wide range of indicators  to assess how close the economy is to maximum employment.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The use of \"a wide range of indicators\" indicates a comprehensive approach to evaluating the economy's proximity to maximum employment, without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "The headline unemployment rate is arguably the best single indicator of labor market conditions .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the headline unemployment rate is considered a significant factor in assessing labor market conditions. However, it does not directly indicate whether the sentence has hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "As I noted, the unemployment rate is currently at 4.1 percent, which is a bit below the FOMC\u2019s median estimate of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of the unemployment rate being below the FOMC's estimate implies that there may be room for further accommodative measures to support the economy."}, {"sentence": "H owever, the unemployment rate does not paint a complete picture.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the unemployment rate alone is not sufficient to fully understand the state of the economy. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it does not explicitly lean towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "For example, to be counted in the official measure as unemployed, a person must have actively looked for a job in the past four weeks.3  People who have not looked for work as recently are counted not as unemployed, but as out of the labor force , even though some of them  actually want a job                                                  1 See t he FOMC\u2019s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, amended effective January 30 , 2018, available on the Board\u2019s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the criteria for counting individuals as unemployed or out of the labor force. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "2 This fundamental uncertainty has been extensively studied, particularly with respect to the most commonly used measure of full employment --the so -called natural rate o f unemployment.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the study of fundamental uncertainty and the natural rate of unemployment, without providing any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The authors of one well -regarded study concluded that even when using sophisticated statistical techniques, the natural rate of unemployment could be as much as 1 -1/2 percentage points above or below their point estimate.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses a study on the natural rate of unemployment, which does not directly impact the decision-making process of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding interest rates."}, {"sentence": "See Douglas Stai ger, James H.

It simply states that some individuals who work part-time may desire a full-time job, which does not have direct implications on the monetary policy's hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "And still others who say that they do not want a job right now might be pulled into the job market if the right opportunity came along.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It implies that there are individuals who are currently not seeking employment but could potentially enter the job market if suitable opportunities arise.

It does not provide a clear indication of whether the FOMC's stance on monetary policy is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Figure 3 shows the headline unemployment rate and two  broader measures of unemployment, known as U -5 and U -6.4  U-5 includes the unemployed plus peo ple who say they want a job and  have looked for one in the past year  (though not in the past four weeks ).", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it provides information on the different measures of unemployment. It does not indicate any hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Like the headline unemployment rate, both U -5 and U -6 have declined significantly in recent years.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the decline in alternative measures of unemployment rates (U-5 and U-6) without providing any indication of the Federal Reserve's stance."}, {"sentence": "They are now at  levels seen before the financial crisis, though not quite as low as they w ere in 199 9 to 2000, a period of very tight job market conditions.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that interest rates are currently at levels similar to those before the financial crisis, indicating a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The reference to the job market conditions being tight in 1999 to 2000 is irrelevant to the current policy implications."}, {"sentence": "The left panel of the next chart shows that employers are having about as much difficulty now attracting qualified workers as they did 20 years ago  (figure 4).", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any direct implications on the stance of the Federal Reserve.

The high job vacancy rate, increased average time to fill job openings, and households reporting plentiful jobs indicate a strong labor market. This may imply a need for tighter monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "In addition, the proportion of workers quitting their jobs is high, suggesting that workers are being hired away from their current employers and that                                                  4 The o fficial unemployment rate  is known as U -3.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the proportion of workers quitting their jobs and the official unemployment rate, which do not directly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "5 These data are from the B ureau of Labor Statistics\u2019  Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS , and start in 2000.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about the source and timeframe of the data used in the analysis.

The fact that individuals are voluntarily leaving their jobs before securing a new one indicates a level of confidence in the job market, which could imply a stronger economy and potentially support a more accommodative monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "While the data I have discussed thus far do point to a tight labor market, other data are less definitive.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. Although the data mentioned indicate a tight labor market, the presence of less definitive data implies a cautious approach. Therefore, it does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish policy stance, making it irrelevant in determining the direction of US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of working age individuals who are either  working or actively looking for a job, has remained steady for about four years  (figure 6).", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence is neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy.

It also mentions that employers are more open to hiring and training workers they previously wouldn't have considered. Wage growth has remained moderate but has picked up compared to earlier in the recovery. This information is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of whether the Federal Reserve will adopt a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "Weak productivity growth is an important reason why we have not seen larger wage gains in recent years.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that weak productivity growth has hindered significant wage gains in recent years. It implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it highlights a key factor that may justify a cautious approach to interest rate hikes, prioritizing economic growth over inflation concerns."}, {"sentence": "At the same time, the absence of a sharper ac celeration in wages suggests that the labor market is not excessively tight.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that although there is no significant increase in wages, implying a non-excessive tightness in the labor market, it does not provide a clear indication of whether the policy will be hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "I will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor market strengthens further.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker is indicating that they will be monitoring wage growth, implying that if it continues to increase, it may lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "6 For disability transition rates, see Ernie Tedeschi (2018) , \u201cWill Employment Keep Growing?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications related to the stance of the Federal Reserve.

It acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding certain indicators but implies that many of them indicate a labor market close to maximum employment."}, {"sentence": "Assessments of the maximum level of employment are uncertain, however, and subject to revision.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is uncertain about the maximum level of employment and acknowledges the possibility of revising their assessments.

The mention of a substantial improvement in the labor market indicates positive economic conditions, while the reference to low inflation implies that there is no immediate need for a hawkish approach to tighten monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Indeed, inflation has continued to run below our 2 percent longer -run objective (figure 9).", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it acknowledges that inflation has remained below the 2 percent objective.

It solely states a fact about the indexes being consistently below 2 percent for the past half-dozen years."}, {"sentence": "This persistent shortf all in inflation from our target has led some to question the traditional relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate, also known as the Phillips c urve.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a persistent shortfall in inflation and questioning the traditional relationship between inflation and unemployment indicates a concern about weak inflationary pressures. This could imply a willingness to maintain accommodative monetary policy to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "Given how low the unemployment rate is, why aren\u2019t we seeing higher inflation now?", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that despite the low unemployment rate, the absence of higher inflation raises concerns. This indicates a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy, as the focus may be on supporting economic growth rather than combating inflation."}, {"sentence": "As th ose of you who carefully read the minutes of each FOMC meeting are aware-- and I know there are some of you out there --we had a thorough discussion of inflation dynamics at our January meeting.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC had a detailed discussion on inflation dynamics during their January meeting.

The acknowledgment of a weaker link between labor market tightness and inflation implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may be less inclined to raise interest rates in response to low unemployment rates, as they consider the relationship less reliable."}, {"sentence": "Participants also noted that other factors, including inflation expectations and transitory changes in energy and import prices, can affect inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that participants in the FOMC acknowledge the influence of various factors, such as inflation expectations and temporary fluctuations in energy and import prices, on inflation.
