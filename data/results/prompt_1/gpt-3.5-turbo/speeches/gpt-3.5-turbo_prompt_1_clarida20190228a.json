[{"sentence": "Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the 35th Annual Economic Policy Conference of the National Association for Business Economics.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it expresses gratitude for participating in a conference and does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Before we begin our conversation, I want to share a few thoughts about the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.1Current Economic Situation and Outlook\r\nThe U.S. economy expanded at a robust pace in 2018, and my baseline outlook for 2019 foresees somewhat slower but still-solid growth in the year ahead.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it provides a general overview of the current and projected economic situation without indicating any specific stance or direction towards monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In July, just about four months from now, the current economic expansion will become the longest on record.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the duration of the current economic expansion, which does not directly indicate whether the policy will be hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "The Federal Reserve is charged by the Congress with achieving and sustaining a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and the economy is as close as it has been in many years to meeting these goals.The unemployment rate is near the lowest level recorded in 50 years, and average monthly job gains have continued to well outpace the increases needed over the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability being close to being achieved implies that the current policy may lean towards tightening to prevent potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Most measures of nominal wage growth are running at or somewhat above the 3 percent pace, and recent wage gains have been strongest for lower-skilled workers.Moreover, the strength of the labor market appears to have encouraged people to join the labor force and others, who might have left it, to continue working.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of nominal wage growth running above 3 percent and stronger wage gains for lower-skilled workers indicates a potential need for tighter monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures. Additionally, the strength of the labor market attracting more people to join and continue working implies a positive economic outlook, further supporting a hawkish stance."}, {"sentence": "The labor force participation rate--the share of people who are either working or looking for work--has moved up 1/2 percentage point over the past year, and the participation rate of prime-age workers (those 25 to 54 years old) has risen about 1-1/2 percentage points over the past few years.Inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), is estimated to have been a little bit below 2 percent of late, largely because of recent declines in energy prices.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the labor force participation rate has increased, particularly among prime-age workers. Additionally, it mentions that inflation has been slightly below 2 percent due to declines in energy prices. These factors are relevant to US monetary policy as they provide insights into the strength of the labor market and potential inflationary pressures. However, the sentence does not explicitly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "However, core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, is estimated to have been about 2 percent.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that core PCE inflation, a better indicator of future inflation, is estimated to have been around 2 percent. This indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it aligns with the Federal Reserve's target inflation rate."}, {"sentence": "Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower, on net, since last summer, though they have increased some recently, and some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of market-based measures of inflation compensation moving lower implies a lack of inflationary pressure, while the slight recent increase and unchanged survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations indicate a neutral outlook."}, {"sentence": "That said, taken together, the evidence suggests that measures of expected inflation are at the lower end of a range that I consider to be consistent with our price-stability goal of 2 percent PCE inflation.While my baseline outlook for growth, employment, and inflation is a positive one, a number of crosscurrents that are buffeting the economy bear careful scrutiny.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of expected inflation being at the lower end of the desired range indicates a dovish sentiment, as it may warrant accommodative measures. However, the acknowledgement of crosscurrents requiring scrutiny implies a cautious approach, which can be seen as hawkish. Overall, the sentence reflects a balanced and cautious stance, making it neutral."}, {"sentence": "Global growth is slowing, particularly in China and Europe.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that global growth is slowing, specifically in China and Europe. As the FOMC focuses on US monetary policy, this information is relevant but does not directly indicate a stance. Therefore, it can be considered neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Global policy uncertainty remains elevated.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that global policy uncertainty is still high. Although it does not directly address US monetary policy, it implies a cautious approach may be necessary. Therefore, it can be considered as a dovish signal for US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "And financial conditions have been volatile, making efforts to extract signal from noise more challenging.Monetary Policy\r\nAs I have indicated in recent speeches, monetary policy at this juncture needs to be especially data dependent, with the federal funds rate now in the range of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run neutral level.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current financial conditions have been volatile, which makes it more challenging to interpret signals and make decisions regarding monetary policy. It emphasizes the need for data dependency in determining the appropriate course of action. Therefore, it is relevant to US monetary policy and implies a neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "Moreover, with employment and inflation now at or close to our dual-mandate objectives, the FOMC in its January statement indicated it can afford to be patient as we assess the need for further adjustments in our policy stance.2 Going forward, we need, I believe, to be cognizant of the balance we must strike between (1) being forward looking and (2) maximizing the odds of being right given the reality that the models that we consult are not infallible.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC acknowledges that employment and inflation are in line with their objectives, allowing them to be patient in assessing the need for further policy adjustments. They emphasize the importance of finding a balance between being forward-looking and recognizing the limitations of their models."}, {"sentence": "For example, were a model to predict a surge in inflation, a decision for preemptive hikes before the surge is evident in actual data would need to be balanced against the considerable cost of the model being wrong.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the need for a careful balance between preemptive interest rate hikes in response to predicted inflation surges and the potential costs of incorrect predictions by the model."}, {"sentence": "Given muted inflation and stable inflation expectations, I believe we can be patient and allow the data to flow in as we determine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to strike this balance.We also decided at our January meeting to maintain our current operating regime\u00e2\u0080\u0091\u00e2\u0080\u0091a \"floor\" system--for implementing monetary policy.3 The FOMC will continue to set the stance of policy by establishing the target range for the federal funds rate.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"muted inflation\" and \"stable inflation expectations\" indicates that the FOMC believes there is no immediate need for rate adjustments. The decision to maintain the current operating regime further supports a neutral or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "The interest on excess reserves rate will be our primary tool to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the interest on excess reserves rate will play a crucial role in maintaining the federal funds rate within the desired range. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it focuses on the operational tool rather than indicating a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "In this regime, we will provide an ample supply of reserves in the banking system to ensure that we remain on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve and that the federal funds rate is insulated from shocks to reserve demand and supply.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. By providing an ample supply of reserves, the central bank aims to keep the federal funds rate stable and unaffected by changes in reserve demand and supply, indicating a cautious and accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "With this decision on our operating regime made, the Committee can now decide on the appropriate timing and pace for concluding our balance sheet drawdown.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the decision on the operating regime has been finalized, allowing the Committee to focus on determining the timing and pace of concluding the balance sheet drawdown. It is neutral in terms of US monetary policy as it does not indicate a specific inclination towards being hawkish or dovish."}, {"sentence": "In the longer run, the ultimate size of the balance sheet will be determined by the demand for Federal Reserve liabilities such as currency and reserve balances.Finally, in November, we announced a review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the longer-term determination of the balance sheet size and the review of the Federal Reserve's policy strategy, tools, and communications practices. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In this review, we will listen carefully to a broad range of stakeholders offering a full range of perspectives from across the country, and we will draw on these insights as we assess how best to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability in the most robust fashion possible.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The focus is on gathering diverse perspectives to assess the best approach for achieving maximum employment and price stability, without indicating a preference for hawkish or dovish actions."}, {"sentence": "Taking these viewpoints on board, the FOMC will begin its own discussions this summer on how we might refine our framework and will provide a public assessment after the review is completed.4Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to our conversation.\u00a01.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is open to considering changes to its framework for US monetary policy. It implies a neutral stance as it does not indicate a clear preference for either hawkish or dovish policies."}, {"sentence": "The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee participants.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it simply states that the views expressed are personal and may not align with other members of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."}, {"sentence": "I am grateful to Brian Doyle of the Federal Reserve Board staff for his assistance in preparing this text.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it expresses gratitude towards an individual for their assistance in preparing a text, without providing any indication of the stance or implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), \"Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,\" press release, January 30.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence refers to a press release by the Federal Reserve on January 30, 2019.
