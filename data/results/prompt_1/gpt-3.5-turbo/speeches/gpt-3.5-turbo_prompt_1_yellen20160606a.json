It solely states the average productivity growth rate from 2007:Q4 to 2016:Q1."}, {"sentence": "By comparison, business-sector productivity growth averaged 1-1/2 percent per year over the two decades from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, and then it averaged 2-3/4 percent per year over the next dozen years until the latest recession began.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses historical trends in business-sector productivity growth. It does not provide any indication of the current or future stance of monetary policy, making it unrelated to the terms hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Similarly, Fernald (2014) dates the most recent slowdown in measured productivity growth to before the great recession, in 2005.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses a study on productivity growth dating back to 2005, which does not provide any direct implications on the current stance of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The neutral rate is not directly observable and must instead be inferred from economic data, and estimates will vary depending on the methodology employed.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC acknowledges the challenge of determining the neutral rate, which is irrelevant to immediate US monetary policy decisions. The FOMC recognizes that estimates of the neutral rate can differ based on the methodology used, making it difficult to take a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "However, we know that the neutral rate must have been well below its historical norm in recent years, because with the actual real interest having been as low as it has been lately, the economy would have otherwise expanded much more than has been the case.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the neutral rate, which indicates a balanced monetary policy, has been below its historical norm in recent years. The low real interest rates have prevented the economy from expanding significantly, indicating a need for accommodative measures."}, {"sentence": "In recent years, the neutral rate has likely been held down below normal levels because of the factors I discussed earlier, including persistently weak growth abroad, the high exchange value of the dollar, low rates of household formation, and weak productivity growth.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the neutral rate has been kept below normal levels due to various factors, such as weak global growth, a strong dollar, low household formation rates, and sluggish productivity growth. These factors imply a dovish stance on US monetary policy, as they indicate a need for accommodative measures to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "As I have noted before (see Yellen, 2015b), there is empirical evidence to support the conclusion that the neutral rate is currently not far from zero.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the neutral rate, which indicates the stance of monetary policy, is currently close to zero. This implies a dovish stance, as it indicates a need for accommodative monetary policy to stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "The targeted federal funds rate, currently 0.37 percent, less the 12-month core inflation rate for personal consumption expenditures through April, equals about negative 1.2 percent.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence indicates a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The negative real interest rate (federal funds rate minus inflation rate) suggests an accommodative approach, aiming to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and spending."}, {"sentence": "There are unconventional policy tools that could be employed to provide further support to aggregate demand, if necessary, and the efficacy and costs of using those tools would be weighed by the FOMC, as appropriate.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is open to using unconventional policy tools to support aggregate demand if needed. The mention of weighing the efficacy and costs implies a neutral stance, as the FOMC will carefully consider the potential impact before deciding on any hawkish or dovish actions."}, {"sentence": "However, so long as these tools are considered imperfect substitutes for the federal funds rate as an instrument of policy, the argument that the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates represents a source of asymmetric risk remains valid.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges that the tools used are imperfect substitutes for the federal funds rate, implying a cautious approach. It also highlights the argument that the lower bound on interest rates poses asymmetric risks, indicating a preference for a more accommodative or neutral policy stance."}, {"sentence": "Uncertainty about where the target range for the federal funds rate will be in the long run provides another reason why increases in policy rates cannot be on a preset path.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of uncertainty about the long-term target range for the federal funds rate implies a cautious approach, indicating that policy rate increases cannot follow a predetermined path."}, {"sentence": "I view the median value of 3-1/4 percent from the March SEP as being a reasonable guess for the longer-run normal rate.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The speaker considers the median value of 3-1/4 percent from the March SEP as a reasonable estimate for the longer-run normal rate, indicating a balanced perspective without leaning towards a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "But FOMC participants have lowered their estimates of the longer-run normal rate over time, and as new evidence comes in and we see how economic conditions evolve, further changes, in either direction, are likely.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC participants have a neutral stance on US monetary policy. They acknowledge the possibility of future changes in either a hawkish or dovish direction depending on the evolving economic conditions and new evidence."}]
