[{"sentence": "It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting.1 I regret that we are not meeting in person, but I look forward, as always, to a conversation with my good friend and one-time colleague Tim Adams.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Reserve.

This implies that the Federal Reserve may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a strong 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a robust, if perhaps somewhat slower, pace in the second half of the year.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The strong 6.4 percent GDP growth in the first half of the year, along with the expectation of continued robust growth in the second half, indicates a positive economic outlook, potentially warranting a less accommodative monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or stance on the future direction of interest rates or monetary measures. It solely discusses the potential GDP growth rate, which does not directly impact the monetary policy stance of being hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "That said, the data also indicate that a surge in COVID-19 cases in the summer and supply-chain bottlenecks held back economic activity in the third quarter.As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite the negative impact of COVID-19 cases and supply-chain issues on economic activity in the third quarter, there has been improvement in the labor market. However, it does not provide a clear indication of the stance on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Job gains as measured by the payroll survey have averaged 550,000 per month over the past three months.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a strong job market with consistent monthly job gains. It suggests a positive outlook on the US economy, which could be seen as hawkish or supportive of a more aggressive monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Labor market progress this year, as measured by the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, has been notable, with this index of 24 labor market indicators since December 2020 closing two-thirds of its shortfall relative to its pre-pandemic level.2 Nonetheless, factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving obligations and ongoing fears of the virus, continue to weigh on employment and participation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the labor market has made significant progress, as indicated by the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators. However, it also acknowledges that pandemic-related factors still have a negative impact on employment and participation. Overall, this information is relevant to US monetary policy as it provides insights into the current state of the labor market, but it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "Thus, the course of the labor market, and indeed that of the economy, continues to depend on the course of the virus.Since February 2020, core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price inflation is running at a 2.9 percent annual pace that is well above what I would consider to be a moderate overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run goal for inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the stance or direction of the policy. It primarily discusses the course of the labor market, economy, and inflation, but does not provide any explicit hawkish, dovish, or neutral implications."}, {"sentence": "Fully reopening the $20 trillion economy this year is taking longer and costing more than it did to shut it down last year.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence implies that the process of fully reopening the $20 trillion economy in the US is proving to be more challenging and expensive than the initial shutdown. However, it does not provide a clear indication of the stance on US monetary policy, thus it is irrelevant in determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "In particular, the reopening has been characterized by significant sectoral shifts in both aggregate demand and supply, and these shifts are causing widespread bottlenecks and triggering substantial changes in the relative price and wage structure of the economy.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the reopening of the economy has led to significant changes in both demand and supply, resulting in bottlenecks and changes in prices and wages. These observations are relevant to US monetary policy as they indicate potential inflationary pressures, which could influence the Federal Reserve's stance."}, {"sentence": "A similar reopening dynamic is playing out in other advanced economies, such as Canada and the United Kingdom.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the reopening dynamic in other advanced economies like Canada and the United Kingdom. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "As these relative price adjustments work their way through the economy, measured inflation rises.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that as relative price adjustments occur, inflation increases. This implies a hawkish stance on US monetary policy, as rising inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt tighter monetary measures to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "But I continue to believe that the underlying rate inflation in the U.S. economy is hovering close to our 2 percent longer-run objective and, thus, that the unwelcome surge in inflation this year, once these relative price adjustments are complete and bottlenecks have unclogged, will in the end prove to be largely transitory.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker believes that the recent surge in inflation will be temporary and that the underlying rate of inflation is close to the desired objective. Therefore, it implies that there may not be a need for immediate tightening measures."}, {"sentence": "And this is a forecast that is shared by the vast majority of economists in the private sector, such as those surveyed by Bloomberg and Blue Chip.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the forecast mentioned is widely supported by economists in the private sector, as indicated by surveys conducted by Bloomberg and Blue Chip. However, it does not provide any direct implications on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether the policy stance is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "That said, I believe, as do most of my colleagues, that the risks to inflation are to the upside, and I continue to be attuned and attentive to underlying inflation trends, in particular measures of inflation expectations, including the Board staff's index of common inflation expectations.3 As Chair Powell has indicated, if we did see indicators of inflation expectations moving up and running persistently above levels consistent with our price stability mandate, monetary policy would react to that.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the risks of inflation increasing and emphasizes the importance of monitoring inflation expectations. They also mention that if inflation expectations rise persistently, monetary policy would respond accordingly, indicating a willingness to tighten policy if necessary."}, {"sentence": "But that is not the case at present.The September Decision and the Forward Guidance in Our FOMC Statement \r\nLet me now say a few words about the decisions reached at our September FOMC meeting.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information about the stance of the FOMC's decisions or the implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Since our December 2020 meeting, the Committee has indicated that it will continue to maintain the pace of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchases at $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until \"substantial further progress\" has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.4 At our September meeting, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward these goals, and I myself believe that the \"substantial further progress\" standard has more than been met with regard to our price-stability mandate and has all but been met with regard to our employment mandate.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker believes that the \"substantial further progress\" standard has been met for price stability and is close to being met for employment. This implies a potential shift towards tapering or reducing asset purchases in the future."}, {"sentence": "If progress continues broadly as expected, the Committee in September judged that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. If progress continues as expected, the Committee anticipates a potential reduction in the pace of asset purchases in September. This indicates a shift towards tightening monetary policy, reflecting a less accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "At our meeting, we also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic conditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the Committee's guidance.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is considering tapering asset purchases once economic conditions meet their criteria. It is a neutral statement as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "While no decisions were made, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering of our asset purchases that concludes around the middle of next year may soon be warranted.It is important to note that any future decision the Committee might make with regard to the pace of asset purchases will not be intended to carry a signal about the timing of a future decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, a policy decision for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The participants believe that if the recovery continues as expected, a gradual tapering of asset purchases may be appropriate by the middle of next year. However, it is irrelevant to interpret this decision as a signal for the timing of a future decision to raise the federal funds rate."}, {"sentence": "As we reaffirmed in September, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4\u00a0percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) intends to maintain the current low interest rates until labor market conditions improve and inflation reaches and exceeds 2 percent. This indicates a cautious approach to tightening monetary policy, prioritizing maximum employment and inflation targets over immediate rate hikes."}, {"sentence": "At least half of the 18 FOMC participants in their Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) submissions projected that these necessary threshold conditions for liftoff will be met by December 2022, and all participants but 1 project that these conditions will be met by December 2023.5 These projections are entirely consistent with the new monetary policy framework adopted unanimously by the Committee in August 2020.6 In the context of our new framework, as I have noted before, while the effective lower bound (ELB) can be a constraint on monetary policy, the ELB is not a constraint on fiscal policy, and appropriate monetary policy under our new framework, to me, must\u00e2\u0080\u0094and certainly can\u00e2\u0080\u0094incorporate this reality.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the majority of FOMC participants expect the necessary conditions for liftoff to be met by December 2022 and all but one participant expect them to be met by December 2023. These projections align with the new monetary policy framework. The sentence is irrelevant to the current stance of US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "Indeed, under present circumstances, I judge that the support to aggregate demand from fiscal policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the nearly $2 trillion in accumulated excess savings accruing from (as yet) unspent transfer payments\u00e2\u0080\u0094in tandem with appropriate monetary policy, can fully offset the constraint, highlighted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, that the ELB imposes on the ability of an inflation-targeting monetary policy, acting on its own and in the absence of sufficient fiscal support, to restore, following a recession, maximum employment and price stability while keeping inflation expectations well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal.7Thank you very much for your time and attention.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the combination of fiscal policy and appropriate monetary policy can fully offset the constraint imposed by the ELB on inflation-targeting monetary policy. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it emphasizes the need for both fiscal and monetary support to achieve maximum employment and price stability."}, {"sentence": "I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Tim.References\r\nAhn, Hie Joo, and Chad Fulton (2020).", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications related to the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
