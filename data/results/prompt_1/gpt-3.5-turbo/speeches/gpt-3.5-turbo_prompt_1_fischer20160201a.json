[{"sentence": "I am looking forward to a lively discussion.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. It simply expresses anticipation for an engaging conversation, which does not directly impact monetary policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "To get things started, I thought I could provide some background on recent monetary policy decisions.1As you all know, at our December meeting my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/4 to 1/2 percent.2 This increase came after seven years during which we kept the federal funds rate at what we call the ELB--the effective lower bound.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy implications as it provides background information on a past decision to raise the federal funds rate. It does not indicate any stance or direction (hawkish, dovish, or neutral) for future policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "This ultra-low rate was in keeping with our congressional mandate to pursue a monetary policy that fosters maximum employment and price stability, which we define as 2 percent inflation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence indicates a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of pursuing a monetary policy that fosters maximum employment and price stability aligns with the Federal Open Market Committee's mandate. The reference to defining price stability as 2 percent inflation suggests a neutral approach towards inflation targeting."}, {"sentence": "Our decision in December was based on the substantial improvement in the labor market and the Committee's confidence that inflation would return to our 2 percent goal over the medium term.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of substantial improvement in the labor market and confidence in inflation returning to the 2 percent goal indicates a positive outlook, implying a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy in the future."}, {"sentence": "Employment growth last year averaged a solid 220,000 per month, and the unemployment rate declined from 5.6 percent to 5.0 percent over the course of 2015.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a strong employment growth and a decrease in the unemployment rate, suggesting a positive outlook on the US economy. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it supports a hawkish stance, indicating potential for tightening monetary measures."}, {"sentence": "Inflation ran well below our target last year, held down by the transitory effects of declines in crude oil prices and also in the prices of non-oil imports.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of inflation running well below the target indicates a need for accommodative measures. The transitory effects of declines in crude oil prices and non-oil imports imply that these factors are temporary and should not be a cause for concern."}, {"sentence": "Prices for these goods have fallen further and for longer than expected.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that prices for certain goods have experienced a more significant and prolonged decline than anticipated. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it may influence the Federal Reserve's decision-making process. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether this development would be considered hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Once these oil and import prices stop falling and level out, their effects on inflation will dissipate, which is why we expect that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term, supported by a further strengthening in labor market conditions.I would note that our monetary policy remains accommodative after the small increase in the federal funds rate adopted in December.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the expectation of rising inflation to 2 percent over the medium term, supported by a strengthening labor market. However, it also highlights that the monetary policy remains accommodative, indicating a cautious approach rather than a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "And my colleagues and I anticipate that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that we expect to prevail in the longer run.Given the large size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, the FOMC is employing new tools to implement monetary policy.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"gradual increases\" and the expectation that the federal funds rate will remain below longer-run levels indicate a cautious approach. The reference to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and the use of new tools further emphasize a dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "In particular, to raise the federal funds rate we increased the interest rate we pay on reserve balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. By increasing the interest rate on reserve balances, the Federal Reserve aims to tighten monetary conditions, indicating a willingness to raise the federal funds rate. This move reflects a more aggressive approach towards controlling inflation and potentially slowing down economic growth."}, {"sentence": "We also employed an overnight reverse repurchase facility, through which we interact with a broad range of firms to help provide a soft floor for the federal funds rate consistent with our target range.3 These new tools have worked well, and the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates have increased slightly, as expected.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the use of the overnight reverse repurchase facility has been effective in maintaining the federal funds rate within the target range. The slight increase in short-term interest rates indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We will continue to monitor financial market developments closely, and we can make adjustments to our tools if necessary to maintain control over money market rates.At our meeting last week, we left our target for the federal funds rate unchanged.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The statement indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will closely monitor financial market developments and make adjustments to their tools if needed to maintain control over money market rates. However, it also mentions that the target for the federal funds rate was left unchanged at the previous meeting, indicating a lack of immediate hawkish or dovish actions."}, {"sentence": "Economic data over the intermeeting period suggested that improvement in labor market conditions continued even as economic growth slowed late last year.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it acknowledges the slowing economic growth but emphasizes the continued improvement in labor market conditions. This indicates a cautious approach towards potential policy changes, prioritizing employment stability over short-term economic fluctuations."}, {"sentence": "But further declines in oil prices and increases in the foreign exchange value of the dollar suggested that inflation would likely remain low for somewhat longer than had been previously expected before moving back to 2 percent.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of further declines in oil prices and increases in the foreign exchange value of the dollar implies that inflation is expected to stay low for a longer period. This indicates a cautious approach towards raising interest rates, aligning with a dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "In addition, increased concern about the global outlook, particularly the ongoing structural adjustments in China and the effects of the declines in the prices of oil and other commodities on commodity exporting nations, appeared early this year to have triggered volatility in global asset markets.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the global outlook, including structural adjustments in China and declines in commodity prices, has caused volatility in global asset markets. However, it does not provide a clear indication of the stance on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "If these developments lead to a persistent tightening of financial conditions, they could signal a slowing in the global economy that could affect growth and inflation in the United States.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that if the mentioned developments result in a continuous restriction of financial conditions, it could indicate a global economic slowdown that may impact growth and inflation in the United States. The implications are dovish as it highlights concerns about potential negative effects on the US economy."}, {"sentence": "But we have seen similar periods of volatility in recent years that have left little permanent imprint on the economy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It implies that despite recent periods of volatility, they have had little lasting impact on the economy. Therefore, it indicates that the FOMC may view these fluctuations as irrelevant in terms of shaping their policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "As the FOMC said in its statement last week, we are closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.4Now, I expect that in a few minutes one of you will ask not about what we did at our last meeting, but rather what we are going to do at the next one.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments, labor market, inflation, and risks to the outlook. The mention of future expectations indicates a focus on upcoming decisions, but does not provide a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish bias."}, {"sentence": "The world is an uncertain place, and all monetary policymakers can really be sure of is that what will happen is often different from what we currently expect.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence reflects a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the world and emphasizes that outcomes often deviate from current expectations. It does not provide any specific indication of a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance."}, {"sentence": "That is why the Committee has indicated that its policy decisions will be data dependent.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. By stating that policy decisions will be data dependent, it implies that the Committee will closely monitor economic indicators before making any changes, indicating a cautious and balanced approach rather than a hawkish or dovish bias."}, {"sentence": "That is, we will adjust policy appropriately in light of economic and financial events to best foster conditions consistent with the attainment of our employment and inflation objectives.As you know, in making our policy decisions, my FOMC colleagues and I spend considerable time assessing the incoming economic and financial information and its implications for the economic outlook.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC will adjust monetary policy based on economic and financial events to achieve their employment and inflation objectives. It indicates a neutral stance, as it emphasizes the need to assess incoming information before making policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "But we also must consider some other issues, two of which I would like to mention briefly today.First, should we be concerned about the possibility of the unemployment rate falling somewhat below its longer-run normal level, as the most recent FOMC projections suggest?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. It merely raises a question about the unemployment rate falling below its longer-run normal level, without expressing any specific policy implications."}, {"sentence": "In my view, a modest overshoot of this sort would be appropriate in current circumstances for two reasons.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker believes that a slight inflationary overshoot would be suitable due to the current circumstances. This implies a willingness to tolerate higher inflation temporarily to support economic recovery."}, {"sentence": "First, other measures of labor market conditions--such as the fraction of workers with part-time employment who would prefer to work full time and the number of people out of the labor force who would like to work--indicate that more slack may remain in labor market than the unemployment rate alone would suggest.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that there may still be significant slack in the labor market, despite the unemployment rate alone not reflecting it. This implies that the Federal Reserve may maintain its accommodative stance to support the labor market's recovery."}, {"sentence": "Second, with inflation currently well below 2 percent, a modest overshoot actually could be helpful in moving inflation back to 2 percent more rapidly.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of inflation being below 2 percent and the suggestion of a modest overshoot being helpful in moving inflation back to 2 percent indicate a willingness to tolerate higher inflation, which aligns with a dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Nonetheless, a persistent large overshoot of our employment mandate would risk an undesirable rise in inflation that might require a relatively abrupt policy tightening, which could inadvertently push the economy into recession.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the concern that a persistent large overshoot of the employment mandate could lead to an undesirable rise in inflation. To prevent this, a relatively abrupt policy tightening might be necessary, which could inadvertently push the economy into recession."}, {"sentence": "Monetary policy should aim to avoid such risks and keep the expansion on a sustainable track.In this context, I would point out that at our January meeting, we reaffirmed our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy with an adjustment to clarify that our inflation goal is symmetric.5 That is, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below our objective.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding risks and maintaining a sustainable economic expansion. The mention of reaffirming the inflation goal as symmetric indicates a balanced approach, which is neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "In my view, even if inflation was expected to return to 2 percent over time, persistent deviations from our goal in either direction could cause economic harm and could ultimately unmoor longer-term inflation expectations.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the potential economic harm caused by persistent deviations from the 2 percent inflation goal, which could unsettle longer-term inflation expectations."}, {"sentence": "Of course, whether the Committee would take action to address a persistent deviation from its inflation objective would depend on the circumstances--and, in particular, on the outlook for employment and inflation and an assessment of the likely lags in the effects of monetary policy.My second topic is how best to integrate balance sheet policy with interest rate policy.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the integration of balance sheet policy with interest rate policy, rather than indicating a stance on the hawkish, dovish, or neutral approach towards addressing inflation deviations or the outlook for employment and inflation."}, {"sentence": "The Committee has indicated that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the Federal Reserve aims to hold only the necessary amount of securities to efficiently implement monetary policy in the longer run, without leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "But that statement leaves open the question of when we should begin to reduce the size of our balance sheet.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the question of when to start reducing the balance sheet, indicating a cautious approach. However, it does not provide a clear indication of whether the policy will be hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant in the near term."}, {"sentence": "Because the tools I mentioned earlier--the payment of interest on reserve balances and the overnight reverse repurchase facility--can be used to raise the federal funds rate independent of the size of the balance sheet, we have the flexibility to adjust the size of our balance sheet at the appropriate time.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has the flexibility to adjust the size of their balance sheet independently of the federal funds rate. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it highlights the tools available to manage the balance sheet without explicitly indicating a hawkish or dovish bias."}, {"sentence": "With the federal funds rate still quite low and expected to rise only gradually, I think there is some benefit to maintaining a larger balance sheet for a time.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of the federal funds rate being low and expected to rise gradually implies a cautious approach. Additionally, the suggestion of maintaining a larger balance sheet indicates a preference for accommodative measures, supporting a dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Doing so should help support accommodative financial conditions and so reduce the downside risks to the economic outlook in the event of a future adverse shock to the economy.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. By supporting accommodative financial conditions, the aim is to mitigate potential risks to the economic outlook in case of future adverse shocks."}, {"sentence": "Consistent with this view, the Committee has decided to continue to reinvest principal payments from its securities portfolio until normalization of the federal funds rate is well under way.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The decision to reinvest principal payments indicates a commitment to maintaining accommodative measures until the normalization of the federal funds rate is well advanced."}, {"sentence": "The decision about when to cease or begin phasing out reinvestment will depend on how economic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve.6Thank you.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the decision on when to stop or start reducing reinvestment will be based on the evolving economic and financial conditions and outlook. It implies a neutral stance, as it indicates a data-dependent approach rather than a clear hawkish or dovish bias."}, {"sentence": "I am grateful to William English for his assistance.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it expresses gratitude towards an individual and does not provide any indication or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."}, {"sentence": "My comments today reflect my own views and are not an official position of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it clarifies that the speaker's comments are personal opinions and not representative of the official stance of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee."}, {"sentence": "See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (2015), \"Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,\" press release, December 16, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20151216a.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant as it only provides a reference to a press release without any specific information about the FOMC statement or its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans are available at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides a link to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, without indicating any specific information or implications regarding the stance of the policy."}, {"sentence": "See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (2016), \"Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,\" press release, January 27, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20160127a.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant as it only provides a reference to a press release without any specific information about the FOMC statement or its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, amended effective January 26, 2016, is available on the Board's website at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals_20160126.pdf.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides a link to the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, without any indication of its content or implications on the hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "See the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans (see note 1) as well as the discussion under the heading \"System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy\" in the minutes of the September 2015 Committee meeting (www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20150917.htm).", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence refers to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans and the discussion on System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy in the minutes of the September 2015 Committee meeting.
