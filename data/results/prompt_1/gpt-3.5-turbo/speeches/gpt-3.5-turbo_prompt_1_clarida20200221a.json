[{"sentence": "Thank you to the conference organizers for inviting me here to discuss what former Chair Bernanke has famously referred to as a \"hall of mirrors\" problem: a situation in which a central bank's reaction function and financial market prices interact in economically suboptimal and potentially destabilizing ways.1 In my remarks today, I will lay out the way I think about the interplay between financial markets and monetary policy, with a focus on how I myself seek to integrate noisy but often correlated signals about the economy that I glean from models, surveys, and financial markets.2Three Observations\r\nI begin with three unobjectionable observations.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any direct implications or insights on the stance of monetary policy.

It emphasizes the importance of considering long and variable lags, indicating a proactive approach to policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "Policy decisions made today will have no effect on today's inflation or unemployment rates, so good policy needs to assess where the economic fundamentals are going tomorrow to calibrate appropriate policy today.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of assessing future economic fundamentals to determine appropriate policy today, indicating a cautious and balanced approach rather than a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Of course, financial markets are also forward looking.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence implies that financial markets play a significant role in shaping US monetary policy. It suggests a neutral stance as it acknowledges the forward-looking nature of financial markets without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "An asset's value today depends upon its expected future cash flows discounted by a rate that reflects the expected path of the policy rate plus an appropriate risk premium.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence reflects a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of considering future cash flows and the expected path of the policy rate, indicating a balanced approach to assessing an asset's value."}, {"sentence": "Thus, central banks and financial markets are looking at the same data on macro fundamentals to make inferences about the future path of the economy, and, of course, any decisions on the policy path made by the central bank will influence asset prices through the discount factor.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the central bank's decisions on the policy path will have an impact on asset prices through the discount factor. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it highlights the interplay between central banks, financial markets, and macro fundamentals. However, it does not explicitly indicate whether the implications are hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "So optimal monetary policy will (almost) always be correlated with asset prices.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the correlation between optimal monetary policy and asset prices is significant.

This indicates a dovish stance on US monetary policy, as they have been lowering their estimates due to low inflation and unemployment rates."}, {"sentence": "I would argue that these revisions to u* and r* indicate that the FOMC has been data dependent in this second sense and that these updated assessments of u* and r* have had an important influence on the path for the policy rate actually implemented in recent years.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC has been data dependent, considering revisions to u* and r*, which have influenced the implemented policy rate. It implies a neutral stance as it highlights the importance of updated assessments on monetary policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "Indeed, had the Fed not been data dependent in this second sense and remained closed to the possibility that the economy had changed and historical estimates of r* and u* needed to be revised, that stubbornness would have represented a material policy mistake.In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the Fed's data dependency is crucial in avoiding policy mistakes. It implies that being closed to the possibility of revising estimates of r* and u* would have been a hawkish stance, potentially leading to an inappropriate monetary policy.

It acknowledges that financial market signals are unreliable indicators of the economy's position, including inflation expectations and the neutral interest rate (r*).

However, it does not explicitly indicate whether the implications are hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The destination for the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of futures prices is in turn the sum of the market-implied r* plus market-implied expected inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the implied destination for the federal funds rate is determined by the combination of market-implied r* (neutral interest rate) and market-implied expected inflation. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it provides insight into the factors influencing the rate decision, but it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "But these signals from interest rate futures are only a pure measure of the expected policy rate path under the assumption of a zero risk premium.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the signals from interest rate futures are not a comprehensive indicator of the expected policy rate path, as they do not account for any risk premium. Therefore, it is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide a complete picture of the expected policy rate path."}, {"sentence": "For this reason, it is useful to compare policy rate paths derived from market prices with the path obtained from surveys of market participants, which, while subject to measurement error, should not be contaminated with a term premium.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the importance of comparing policy rate paths derived from market prices and surveys of market participants. It emphasizes that the latter should not be influenced by a term premium, indicating a cautious and unbiased approach."}, {"sentence": "Market- and survey-based estimates of the policy rate path are often highly correlated.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the correlation between market- and survey-based estimates of the policy rate path is significant. While it doesn't directly indicate a specific stance on US monetary policy, it highlights the importance of considering these estimates when formulating a monetary policy strategy. Therefore, it can be considered neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "But when there is a divergence between the path or destination for the policy rate implied by the surveys and a straight read of interest rate derivatives prices, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidence\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, derived from the surveys of primary dealers and market participants conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u00e2\u0080\u0094as I do on the estimates obtained from market prices.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker considers survey evidence, such as those from primary dealers and market participants, to be equally important as estimates obtained from market prices when there is a discrepancy between the two. This implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as the speaker does not favor one over the other, indicating a balanced approach."}, {"sentence": "Finally, as another reality check, I, of course, always consult the latest estimate of r* produced by the Laubach and Williams (2003) unobservable components state-space model, which, I should point out, includes no information on asset prices other than the short-term nominal interest rate itself.6Quotes from the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market can provide valuable information about both r* and expected inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC considers the estimate of r* produced by the Laubach and Williams model as a reality check for US monetary policy. The sentence also implies that quotes from the TIPS market can provide valuable information about r* and expected inflation. However, since the sentence does not explicitly state whether this information is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant to US monetary policy, its implications on US monetary policy are irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "TIPS market data, together with nominal Treasury yields, can be used to construct measures of \"breakeven inflation\" or inflation compensation that provide a noisy signal of market expectations of future inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence is neutral as it discusses the use of TIPS market data and nominal Treasury yields to construct measures of \"breakeven inflation\" or inflation compensation. It implies that these measures can provide a signal of market expectations of future inflation, but it does not directly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "But, again, a straight read of breakeven inflation based on TIPS curve forward real rates needs to be augmented with a model to filter out the liquidity and risk premium components that place a wedge between inflation compensation and expected inflation.It is again useful to compare estimates of expected inflation derived from breakeven inflation data with estimates of expected inflation obtained from surveys\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, the expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that a straight analysis of breakeven inflation based on TIPS curve forward real rates is insufficient and needs to be supplemented with a model to account for liquidity and risk premium factors. It also highlights the importance of comparing breakeven inflation estimates with survey-based expected inflation. This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "Market- and survey-based estimates of expected inflation are correlated, but, again, when there is a divergence between the two, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidence as on the market-derived estimates.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the correlation between market and survey-based estimates of expected inflation but emphasizes placing equal importance on survey evidence when there is a divergence. This indicates a balanced approach rather than a hawkish or dovish bias."}, {"sentence": "Again, here I also consult time-series models of underlying inflation, such as Stock and Watson (2007) and Cecchetti and others (2017), presented at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in 2017.7 At the Fed, the staff have estimated a state-space model decomposition of the common factor that drives a number of different measures of inflation expectations.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is actively considering various time-series models and research papers to analyze underlying inflation. It suggests a neutral stance as it highlights the Fed's efforts to gather information and understand the factors influencing inflation expectations."}, {"sentence": "As I look at all of this evidence from market signals, surveys, and econometric models, I judge that inflation expectations reside at the low end of the range I consider consistent with our price-stability goal of 2 percent personal consumption expenditure inflation in the long run.In both of the examples I have just discussed, the medium-frequency evolution of market-based, survey-based, and model-based estimates of r* and expected inflation have, over time, tended to move broadly together.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker is analyzing various indicators such as market signals, surveys, and econometric models to assess inflation expectations. Based on this analysis, the speaker concludes that inflation expectations are at the lower end of the range considered consistent with the 2 percent inflation goal. The sentence is neutral as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "When high-frequency market signals diverge from the survey- and model-based estimates, the potential benefit from increasing the weight on a signal derived from a forward-looking asset price versus backward estimates from models and slowly evolving surveys must be balanced against the cost of treating the noise in the asset price as a signal.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the need to carefully consider the trade-off between incorporating forward-looking asset prices and relying on backward estimates and surveys. The mention of balancing the potential benefit and cost indicates a cautious approach, neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "There is no unique way to do this, and judgment is required.In conclusion, while my colleagues and I are attuned to the potential for a hall of mirrors problem, in my experience this affliction is one the Federal Reserve guards against and does not suffer from.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. It discusses the potential for a \"hall of mirrors problem\" but states that the Federal Reserve is not affected by it."}, {"sentence": "My colleagues and I do look at developments in asset markets, but never in isolation and always in the context of balancing asset market signals with complementary signals from surveys and econometric models.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC members consider developments in asset markets, but they also take into account other signals such as surveys and econometric models. This balanced approach indicates that they do not solely rely on asset market signals, making it irrelevant to categorize it as hawkish or dovish."}, {"sentence": "It is fair to say that when signals from all three sources line up in the same direction\u00e2\u0080\u0094as, for example, has been the case with market-, survey-, and model-based estimates of r*\u00e2\u0080\u0094the effect of those combined signals, at least on my thinking about the policy path, is more material than when the signals provide conflicting interpretations.Thank you for your attention.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that when market-, survey-, and model-based estimates of r* align, it has a significant impact on the speaker's thinking about the policy path. This implies that the speaker's stance on US monetary policy is influenced by these signals, making it relevant to their decision-making process. However, it does not explicitly indicate whether the stance is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "I look forward to hearing from the other panelists and to our discussion.1.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the speaker's stance or preferences.
