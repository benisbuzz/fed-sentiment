The mention of torrid growth, labor supply shortages, and faster wage increases indicates concerns about potential inflationary pressures. This could imply a need for tighter monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy."}, {"sentence": "Wages are a large component of business costs that could pass through to prices more readily than increases in the cost of other inputs.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that if wages increase, it could lead to higher prices more quickly compared to other input costs.
