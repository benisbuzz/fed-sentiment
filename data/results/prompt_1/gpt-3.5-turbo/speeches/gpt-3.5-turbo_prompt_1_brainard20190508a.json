It focuses on acknowledging and appreciating the individuals present at a community listening session."}, {"sentence": "The Federal Reserve is undertaking a review to make sure we are carrying out the monetary policy goals assigned to us by the Congress in the most effective way we can.2 In conducting this review, we are reaching out to communities around the country in sessions like this to understand how you are experiencing the economy day to day.Two Goals\r\nSo what are the monetary policy goals the Congress assigned us?", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the Federal Reserve is undertaking a review to ensure effective implementation of monetary policy goals assigned by Congress. It is neutral as it does not provide any indication of whether the review will lead to a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and price stability.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence implies that the Federal Reserve's mandate from Congress is to use monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and price stability. It is neutral in terms of being hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant, as it simply states the Fed's responsibility without indicating a specific policy stance."}, {"sentence": "These two goals are what we refer to as our dual mandate.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it simply defines the term \"dual mandate\" without providing any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "By price stability we mean moderate and stable inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of price stability, which aligns with the Federal Open Market Committee's objective. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if the statement leans towards a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance."}, {"sentence": "Specifically, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\u00e2\u0080\u0094the group at the Fed responsible for determining monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094has announced that our goal is to keep inflation around 2 percent over time.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC's goal to maintain inflation around 2 percent over time suggests a balanced approach, neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "The maximum employment part of our dual mandate is straightforward: The Congress has directed us to achieve the highest level of employment\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thus the lowest level of unemployment\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is consistent with price stability.While the Congress has specified the goals for monetary policy and a set of tools or authorities to pursue them, it has allowed the FOMC to determine how to best go about achieving those goals.Reviewing How We Conduct Monetary Policy\r\nLast year, core inflation was very close to our goal.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "And the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a strong labor market, which could be seen as a hawkish signal for US monetary policy. A low unemployment rate suggests a potential for inflationary pressures, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish stance to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "We are undertaking our review to ensure we are well positioned to meet our goals for many years to come.We also want to make sure that the way we are setting monetary policy is keeping up with the way the economy is changing, which I have been referring to as the \"new normal.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is taking a proactive approach by reviewing their monetary policy to align with the changing economy, indicating a neutral stance. It implies that they aim to maintain their goals and adapt to the \"new normal\" without leaning towards a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "For example, interest rates have stayed very low in recent years not only in the United States, but also in many other advanced economies.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it highlights the fact that interest rates have remained low not only in the US but also in other advanced economies. This implies a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy, indicating a preference for maintaining an accommodative stance."}, {"sentence": "For a variety of reasons, it seems likely that equilibrium interest rates will remain low in the future.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The expectation of low equilibrium interest rates in the future implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may continue to adopt accommodative measures to stimulate economic growth and maintain a loose monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Low interest rates present a challenge for the traditional ways of conducting monetary policy.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that low interest rates pose a challenge for the traditional methods of conducting monetary policy. It implies a dovish stance as it acknowledges the need for alternative approaches to address the impact of low interest rates on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "That is especially true in recessions when, in the past, the Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates by 4 to 5 percentage points in order to support household spending and business investment.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the Federal Reserve's historical practice of cutting interest rates significantly during recessions to stimulate household spending and business investment, indicating a willingness to take accommodative measures to support the economy."}, {"sentence": "But when equilibrium interest rates are low, we have less room to cut interest rates and thus less room to buffer the economy using our conventional tool.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that when equilibrium interest rates are low, the ability to cut interest rates as a conventional tool to stimulate the economy is limited, indicating a more cautious approach towards monetary policy adjustments."}, {"sentence": "For example, following the most recent recession in 2008 and 2009, we kept interest rates as low as the Committee thought they could go, which was close to zero, for many years.Another big change in the economy is that inflation doesn't move as much with economic activity and employment as it has in the past.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of keeping interest rates close to zero for many years after the recession indicates a cautious approach to stimulate economic growth. Additionally, the observation that inflation is less responsive to economic activity implies a neutral stance as it may require a different policy approach."}, {"sentence": "In many ways, the flatter Phillips curve has advantages: It means that the labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers that may have been sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in inflation, unlike what we saw in the 1960s and 1970s.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a flatter Phillips curve implies that the labor market can improve without causing inflationary pressures, which indicates a more accommodative approach to monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Similarly, inflation doesn't fall as much in recessions.But there is an important risk with today's low sensitivity of inflation to slack: It makes it more difficult to boost inflation to our objective of 2 percent on a sustainable basis.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the concern that the low sensitivity of inflation to economic slack makes it challenging to achieve the objective of 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis."}, {"sentence": "And, as we know from other countries, if inflation consistently falls short of the central bank's objective, lower inflation tends to get embedded in people's expectations.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that if inflation consistently remains below the central bank's target, it may lead to lower inflation expectations among the public. This could have implications for US monetary policy as it may influence the central bank to adopt a more dovish stance to stimulate inflation and meet its objectives."}, {"sentence": "Expectations that inflation will remain low in turn can create a self-fulfilling dynamic with actual inflation, making it even more difficult for the central bank to boost inflation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the concern that expectations of low inflation can lead to a self-fulfilling cycle, making it challenging for the central bank to stimulate inflation. This implies that the central bank may adopt accommodative measures to counteract this effect."}, {"sentence": "And because inflation is reflected in nominal interest rates, that, in turn, can also reduce the amount of policy space the central bank has available to prevent the economy from slipping into recession.In fact, in recent years, central banks around the world have had to use a larger variety of policy tools than they traditionally used to respond to the financial crisis and support economic expansion.Some Issues to Explore\r\nGiven the new normal of low equilibrium interest rates and low sensitivity of inflation to slack, it is prudent to assess how well various approaches worked both here and around the world, with a view to identifying the best ways to promote the goals the Congress assigned to us.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that due to the relationship between inflation and nominal interest rates, the central bank's ability to prevent a recession may be limited. It acknowledges the need for central banks to use a wider range of policy tools in response to the financial crisis. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it calls for an assessment of different approaches to achieve the goals assigned by Congress."}, {"sentence": "As such, we will be looking widely at our tools and strategies, assessing not just the various approaches that were undertaken, but also approaches that have been proposed but not tried.One of those is the idea that the Federal Reserve should explicitly promise to \"make up\" for the fact that interest rates can't be cut as much as during past recessions.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"making up\" for the limited ability to cut interest rates during recessions implies a willingness to explore alternative approaches to stimulate the economy. The Federal Reserve is considering new strategies, indicating a potential shift towards a more accommodative stance."}, {"sentence": "The Federal Reserve could hold interest rates lower after a recession is over, perhaps by promising not to raise interest rates until inflation or the unemployment rate have reached a particular level.A related idea is average inflation targeting, meaning the Fed would aim to achieve its inflation objective on average over a longer period of time\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps over the business cycle.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The Federal Reserve may consider holding interest rates lower after a recession, indicating a willingness to support economic recovery. The idea of average inflation targeting also aligns with a dovish approach, as it implies a patient and accommodative stance towards achieving inflation objectives."}, {"sentence": "So if inflation fell short during a recession, the Federal Reserve would aim at inflation above target during the recovery and expansion.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the Federal Reserve would be willing to tolerate inflation above target during the recovery and expansion phase, in order to compensate for previous periods of inflation falling short during a recession."}, {"sentence": "This approach would also have aspects of a make-up policy, as policy would likely be kept easier\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, more accommodative\u00e2\u0080\u0094than otherwise during the period where inflation is above target.While such approaches sound quite appealing on their face, they have not yet been implemented in practice.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the approach of keeping policy easier and more accommodative during periods of above-target inflation is being considered, but it has not been put into practice yet."}, {"sentence": "There is some skepticism that a central bank would in fact prove able to support above-target inflation over a sustained period without becoming concerned that inflation might accelerate and inflation expectations might rise too high.Another idea I would like to hear more about involves targeting the yield on specific securities so that once the short-term interest rates we traditionally target have hit zero, we might turn to targeting slightly longer-term interest rates\u00e2\u0080\u0094initially one-year interest rates, for example, and if more stimulus is needed, perhaps moving out the curve to two-year rates.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of skepticism about the central bank's ability to support above-target inflation without concerns of inflation acceleration implies a cautious approach. Additionally, the idea of targeting longer-term interest rates for stimulus indicates a willingness to provide further support if needed, reinforcing the dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Under this policy, the Federal Reserve would stand ready to use its balance sheet to hit the targeted interest rate, but unlike the asset purchases that were undertaken in the recent recession, there would be no specific commitments with regard to purchases of Treasury securities.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is willing to use its balance sheet to adjust the targeted interest rate, but it does not make any specific commitments regarding purchases of Treasury securities, indicating a lack of dovish or hawkish bias."}, {"sentence": "Similar to make-up policies, such an approach could help communicate publicly how long the Federal Reserve is planning to keep rates low.I should emphasize that these are just a few ideas; there may be other good ideas, and part of the process we are engaged in involves looking around for other ideas.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"make-up policies\" and the exploration of alternative ideas indicate a willingness to consider different approaches. However, it does not explicitly lean towards a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance."}, {"sentence": "Just as the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is sponsoring today's event with representatives of its local community, so too are other Reserve Banks sponsoring similar events.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the sponsorship of events by various Federal Reserve Banks. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "And, in addition to presentations from prominent outside experts, we made sure to add panels to hear from community organizations, training institutions, and other groups that can give us insights on how monetary policy is affecting Main Street.Since I arrived at the Fed, I have put a premium on visiting communities all over the country to get a direct sense of how they are experiencing the economy.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it focuses on the Fed's efforts to gather insights from community organizations and training institutions. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In fact, my first such visit was in this District with community development staff from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses a personal experience and does not provide any information or implications related to the stance of the Federal Reserve."}, {"sentence": "Due to the wisdom of the Fed's original architects, the Federal Reserve System derives tremendous value from interacting with communities from all around the country.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Reserve. It simply highlights the value the Federal Reserve System derives from interacting with communities."}, {"sentence": "In 2015, we created a Community Advisory Council at the Federal Reserve Board, where we hear from a broad variety of community groups and others.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Reserve. It simply mentions the creation of a Community Advisory Council for gathering input from various community groups and others."}, {"sentence": "And many of the regional Federal Reserve Banks have similar councils, including the Richmond Fed's Community Investment Council.In our review this year, we are listening broadly and are seeking perspectives at the community level.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the existence of regional Federal Reserve Banks and their councils, without providing any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. It simply highlights the review process and the importance of community perspectives."}, {"sentence": "How is your community experiencing today's economy?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it pertains to the perception of the community's experience with the current economy, rather than providing any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Is everyone who wants a job able to get one?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it pertains to the labor market rather than monetary policy. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Are businesses finding it relatively easy to hire the workers they need?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the stance or implications on monetary policy. It focuses on the ease of hiring workers for businesses, which does not directly relate to the hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance of the policy."}, {"sentence": "What about inflation and pricing power?", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is concerned about inflation and pricing power. It implies a hawkish stance as the committee is likely to adopt a more cautious approach towards monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures and maintain control over pricing power."}, {"sentence": "And what about the availability and cost of credit\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether it be to start or expand a small business, buy a car to get to work, or invest in owning a home or getting a degree?", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence highlights the importance of credit availability and cost for various purposes. While it does not directly address US monetary policy, it reflects a neutral stance by emphasizing the potential impact on economic activities."}, {"sentence": "I look forward to hearing your views on these and other questions.1.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. It simply expresses an interest in receiving opinions on various matters, without directly addressing monetary policy decisions or implications."}, {"sentence": "I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it expresses gratitude towards an individual for their assistance in preparing a text, without providing any indication of the stance or implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it clarifies that the remarks expressed are personal opinions and not reflective of the official stance of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."}, {"sentence": "Janet L.
