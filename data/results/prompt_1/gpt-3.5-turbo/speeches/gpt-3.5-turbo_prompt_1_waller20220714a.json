[{"sentence": "Thank you, Mike, and thank you to the Global Interdependence Center for the invitation to speak to you today.1 Let me start at the place that all remarks about U.S. monetary policy should start, which is with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.2As I discuss below, we have a very strong labor market, with an unemployment rate that is below the median of policymakers' expected longer-run level, and high inflation that is far above our target.3 We are achieving our mandate when it comes to maximum employment, but we are far from achieving our goal of stable prices.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it primarily focuses on expressing gratitude and acknowledging the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. It does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of monetary policy, making it unrelated to the terms 'hawkish', 'dovish', 'neutral', or their implications."}, {"sentence": "Consequently, while any monetary policy decision has implications for achieving maximum employment, and I will address those implications in a moment, the FOMC is now, and must be, utterly focused on moving inflation down toward our 2 percent target.We must be focused on reducing inflation because, despite a lot of talk about recession lately, the evidence from the labor market indicates the economy is on track, while inflation continues to be far too high.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC is emphasizing the importance of reducing inflation towards the 2 percent target, indicating a willingness to prioritize inflation control over maximum employment. The mention of the economy being on track and inflation being too high implies a need for tighter monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "It must be our focus because high inflation is the biggest challenge to sustaining our employment goal, and the greatest burden for individuals and families, especially lower- and moderate-income households that dedicate a larger share of their spending to necessities.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The focus on high inflation as the biggest challenge to employment goals indicates a cautious approach, prioritizing stability. The mention of lower- and moderate-income households highlights the need for policies that support economic recovery and address income inequality."}, {"sentence": "Inflation has to be our focus, every meeting and every day, because the spending and pricing decisions people and businesses make every day depend on their expectations of future inflation, which in turn depend on whether they believe the Fed is sufficiently committed to its inflation target.So let me be clear: I am going to vote to set policy in a manner that will reduce inflation and achieve our price stability goal, and today I will explain why I don't see that progress conflicting with our maximum-employment goal.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence reflects a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker emphasizes the importance of focusing on inflation and expresses a commitment to reducing it. They believe that progress in reducing inflation does not conflict with the goal of maximum employment."}, {"sentence": "Let me start with my view of the labor market and inflation, then turn to the implications for monetary policy, and conclude with where I think the economy is headed.A Puzzle: Very Tight Labor Market but Declining GDP\r\nAs many economists are discussing, recent economic data have created a puzzle.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the stance or direction of the policy. It merely introduces a puzzle related to the labor market and GDP, without mentioning any specific implications or policy actions."}, {"sentence": "The labor market continues to be very strong, but the real economy appears to be faltering.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. While the labor market remains strong, the indication of a faltering real economy implies a need for potential stimulus measures to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "How might gross domestic product (GDP) fall in the first half of 2022 while the economy created 2.7 million jobs in the same time period?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses a potential contradiction between GDP and job creation in the first half of 2022. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Is the labor market not as strong as it appears or is the economy doing better than the data suggests?To assess the strength of the labor market, there are numerous indicators of its health, and sometimes they point in different directions.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the possibility of the labor market not being as strong as it seems, but also considers the chance of the economy performing better than the available data indicates. The sentence emphasizes the need to consider multiple indicators, indicating a cautious and balanced approach, which is neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "Based on every major labor market indicator, the labor market is very strong and, in historical terms, very tight.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The indication of a very strong and tight labor market implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "The timeliest evidence for this strength was the jobs report that came out last Friday for the month of June, which found that the economy created 372,000 jobs.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a strong jobs report indicates a robust economy, which may lead to a potential tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "Now, I will admit my vision isn't what it used to be, but with revisions to May and April, it is hard to see any slowing in the pace of monthly job creation since February: 398,000 in March, then 368, 384, and 372.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). It solely discusses the speaker's vision and the pace of monthly job creation, without indicating any hawkish, dovish, or neutral views."}, {"sentence": "In the first half of 2022, the economy has created 2.7 million jobs.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a positive development in the US economy, suggesting a potentially hawkish stance on monetary policy. The strong job creation in the first half of 2022 may imply a need for the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary measures to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "That isn't a picture of a weakening job market.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it implies that the job market is not weakening. This could indicate a potential reluctance to implement aggressive monetary measures, such as interest rate hikes, in order to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "The unemployment rate in June was steady at 3.6 percent.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about the unemployment rate in June, without indicating any implications or potential changes in the policy."}, {"sentence": "It is often said that this is \"close to a half-century low\" and that is true, but you really have to go back 69 years, to 1953, to find the unemployment rate more than a couple tenths of a point lower than it was in June.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current unemployment rate is close to a historically low level, dating back to 1953. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it indicates a strong labor market, which could influence a more hawkish stance by the Federal Reserve in terms of potential interest rate hikes or tightening measures."}, {"sentence": "This is about as good a job market as any worker has ever seen.The June job report is consistent with other labor market indicators.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the job market, indicating a strong employment situation.

The mention of high job vacancies and the lack of significant change throughout the year implies that the FOMC may maintain its accommodative stance, as there is no urgent need for a hawkish or neutral shift in policy."}, {"sentence": "Job postings, measured by the Labor Department for May and by Indeed for June, have fallen a bit in recent months but are still at historically high levels, consistent with a very tight labor market.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite a slight decline in job postings, they remain at historically high levels, indicating a very tight labor market. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it implies a potentially hawkish stance, as the tight labor market may lead to inflationary pressures and support the case for tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "As a share of the labor force, weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance are near record lows and have been fairly steady all year.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current state of weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance in the US is near record lows and has remained relatively stable throughout the year.

This indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it implies a tight labor market and potential inflationary pressures. However, the mention of slowing economic activity in GDP suggests a more neutral stance as policymakers may need to consider the overall economic conditions before making any policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "The Commerce Department estimates that there was a modest contraction in real GDP for the first quarter of the year, and \"nowcasting\" projections of economic activity, such as the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker, foresee a similar contraction in the second quarter.6 There is also softness in recent spending data, which has been widespread across consumer spending, business investment, housing, and government purchases, as well as some weaker indicators for the manufacturing sector and a deterioration in consumer sentiment, which by some measures are at historically low levels.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that there are indications of a contraction in the US economy, with softness in spending data and weaker indicators for the manufacturing sector. These factors imply a dovish stance on US monetary policy as they signal a potential need for stimulus measures to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "Some argue that a recession has already started.But I don't see how that squares with the job creation data, the low unemployment rate, and overall strong labor market that I described earlier.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker dismisses the argument of a recession by highlighting positive job creation data, low unemployment rate, and a strong labor market, indicating a preference for maintaining current policy rather than implementing more aggressive measures."}, {"sentence": "In addition to the contrasting evidence in the labor market, there are several other reasons why I am very cautious about acting on the GDP estimates and on projections of an output slowdown.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a cautious stance towards acting on GDP estimates and projections of an output slowdown, indicating a neutral outlook on US monetary policy. The focus on contrasting evidence in the labor market implies a careful approach, rather than a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "One is that while first quarter real GDP is now estimated to have shrunk by 1.6 percent, according to another estimate, real gross domestic income (GDI) increased by 1.8 percent.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a divergence between GDP and GDI growth rates in the first quarter. Although the contraction in GDP indicates a weak economy, the increase in GDI implies a stronger income growth. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it may influence the Federal Reserve's assessment of the overall economic conditions. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this information is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "GDP and GDI are basically measuring the same activity in different ways, and in the past when such wide gaps in the two numbers have appeared initially, they tend to move toward each other when the data are finalized.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It highlights that GDP and GDI, although measuring the same activity differently, tend to converge when initial gaps appear. However, it does not provide any explicit indication of a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant impact on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We know that there were some unusual trade-related reasons for the low GDP number in the first quarter that are unlikely to be repeated, and revisions in both GDP and GDI could largely erase that contraction in output.And, the data that point to some slowing don't convince me that it will damage the labor market.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the low GDP number in the first quarter but believes it was due to unusual trade-related reasons that are unlikely to be repeated. They also express confidence that revisions in GDP and GDI could offset the contraction. Additionally, they state that the data indicating some slowing does not convince them that it will harm the labor market. Overall, this implies a cautious and less concerned approach towards the current economic conditions, indicating a dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Measures of manufacturing activity and indicators of future activity, such as the purchasing manager's index, have moderated but are still in expansionary territory.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that although measures of manufacturing activity have slowed down, they are still in expansionary territory. This indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it neither leans towards a hawkish nor a dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Rather than a recession, the softening data seem consistent with the pandemic-related transition underway since last year among consumers from spending on goods to spending on services.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the softening data, which indicates a shift in consumer spending patterns, is not indicative of a recession but rather a result of the ongoing transition from goods to services due to the pandemic."}, {"sentence": "And we should expect that as policy tightening feeds through the economy it will dampen household and business spending decisions\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is the objective of our policy tightening.Past experience has shown that job creation and the unemployment rate are timely indicators of a recession, more timely than quarterly GDP.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the objective of policy tightening is to dampen household and business spending decisions, indicating a desire to slow down economic growth. The mention of job creation and unemployment rate as timely indicators of a recession further supports a hawkish approach."}, {"sentence": "I will watch all the data carefully, but the factors I just cited, along with the evident strength across different measures of the labor market, leave me feeling fairly confident that the U.S. economy did not enter a recession in the first half of 2022 and that the economic expansion will continue.Persistently High Inflation\r\nNow let's talk about inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the possibility of a recession and the continuation of economic expansion, rather than addressing the topic of inflation."}, {"sentence": "Yesterday's report on the consumer price index (CPI) for June was a major league disappointment.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence is dovish as it suggests that the consumer price index (CPI) report for June was significantly below expectations, indicating a potential slowdown in inflation.

The high inflation rate of 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years, suggests a potential need for the Federal Reserve to adopt a more aggressive stance to control inflation, possibly through tightening monetary policy measures."}, {"sentence": "Core, which came down slightly in the last couple months, has averaged over 6 percent this year, and is too high as well.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of core inflation being too high indicates a concern about rising prices. This could imply a potential need for tighter monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "No matter how you look at the data, inflation is far too high and my job is to move it down toward our 2 percent target.We know that supply shortages and bottlenecks, including the tight labor market, have contributed to the high inflation readings we are observing.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the high inflation and emphasizes their responsibility to bring it down towards the 2 percent target. They attribute the high inflation to supply shortages and bottlenecks, including the tight labor market."}, {"sentence": "We also know that the surge in demand during the pandemic that was driven by excess saving, significant fiscal stimulus, and accommodative monetary policy also has contributed to the high inflation we are now experiencing.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the surge in demand during the pandemic, fueled by excess saving, fiscal stimulus, and accommodative monetary policy, has contributed to the current high inflation. It implies a dovish stance as it acknowledges the role of monetary policy in driving inflation."}, {"sentence": "There is some research estimating how much of this inflation came from supply problems and how much from high demand.7 The main point is that both played a large part in driving the inflation that we have seen over the past year.But the causes of inflation don't affect my approach to policy because in writing the FOMC's mandate, Congress did not say \"Your goal is price stability unless inflation is caused by supply shocks, in which case you are off the hook.\"", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the causes of inflation and the FOMC's mandate. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance towards monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We want to reduce excessive inflation, whatever the source, in part because whether it comes from supply or demand, high inflation can push up longer-run inflation expectations and thus affect spending and pricing decisions in the near term.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The focus on reducing excessive inflation, regardless of its source, indicates a proactive approach to maintain price stability. The mention of inflation expectations impacting spending and pricing decisions emphasizes the importance of controlling inflationary pressures in the near term."}, {"sentence": "These decisions can then push up prices even more and make inflation harder to get under control.I pay attention to both surveys of the public's inflation expectations and measures of inflation expectations derived from trading of inflation-indexed securities.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker pays attention to both surveys and trading measures of inflation expectations. This indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the importance of monitoring inflation, without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "I prefer the latter market-based measures, which are down from recent peaks but still elevated.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The preference for market-based measures indicates a focus on economic indicators, while acknowledging their decline from recent highs. However, the fact that they remain elevated implies a cautious approach, neither hawkish nor dovish, but rather a balanced and vigilant stance."}, {"sentence": "The Board staff combines various surveys and market-based measures in our Index of Common Inflation Expectations, which has moved up slightly in recent months after being flat for a long time.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a slightly hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The increase in the Index of Common Inflation Expectations indicates a potential rise in inflation, which may influence the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "We need to avoid expectations rising so much that they become a factor that drives inflation higher.The Path of Monetary Policy\r\nSo, based on persistently high inflation and the very tight labor market that I have described, let's talk about the implications for monetary policy.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the need to avoid expectations that could drive inflation higher, indicating a concern for controlling inflation. Given the description of persistently high inflation and a tight labor market, it implies a potential tightening of monetary policy to address these concerns."}, {"sentence": "Since March, the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate three times for a cumulative 150 basis points.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it highlights the FOMC's actions of raising the federal funds rate three times since March, resulting in a cumulative increase of 150 basis points."}, {"sentence": "This is the fastest pace of tightening in close to 30 years.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the pace of tightening, referring to increasing interest rates or reducing monetary stimulus, is happening at a rapid rate, which indicates a more aggressive approach by the Federal Reserve."}, {"sentence": "At our last meeting, we raised the policy rate by 75 basis points, which is a large move by historical standards.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of raising the policy rate by a significant 75 basis points indicates a tightening approach. The phrase \"large move by historical standards\" further emphasizes the hawkishness, indicating a departure from previous norms."}, {"sentence": "That size increase was not an over-reaction to one data point on inflation\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was primarily the response to a sequence of excessively high inflation readings since the beginning of the year.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"excessively high inflation readings\" implies a concern about inflationary pressures. The size increase mentioned is likely a reference to a tightening of monetary policy to counteract inflation, indicating a less accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "It was appropriate given the lack of progress on inflation and clearly signals the FOMC's commitment to get inflation under control as soon as possible.The response of financial markets to the FOMC's policy actions and communications indicate to me that the Committee retains the credibility and the public confidence that is needed to make monetary policy effective.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates the FOMC's commitment to addressing inflation and their belief that their policy actions and communications have been effective, as reflected by the positive response of financial markets."}, {"sentence": "Longer-term interest rates have moved up to levels not far from those reflected in Committee members' estimates of the final destination for the federal funds rate in this tightening cycle, effectively implementing policy ahead of time.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The fact that longer-term interest rates have already reached levels close to the Committee's estimated final destination for the federal funds rate implies that policy tightening has been implemented earlier than expected."}, {"sentence": "The average rate for a 30-year conforming fixed rate home mortgage has increased by more than two percentage points since the end of 2021.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish implication on US monetary policy. The significant increase in the average rate for a 30-year conforming fixed rate home mortgage suggests a tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a more restrictive approach by the Federal Reserve to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "While there is some slowdown in home sales, lenders and borrowers are still doing business at these rates, which indicates that they believe the FOMC's policy intentions are credible, as broadly reflected in the interest rate paths in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).As I have said before, with inflation so high, there is a virtue in front-loading tightening so that policy moves as soon as is practical to a setting that restricts demand.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a slowdown in home sales and the need to front-load tightening to restrict demand indicates a willingness to take action to combat high inflation, reflecting a more aggressive approach towards policy tightening."}, {"sentence": "Getting there sooner will bolster the public's confidence that we can get inflation down and it will preserve options for adjusting the pace of tightening later if needed.With this view, it should not be surprising that looking toward the FOMC's next meeting July 26-27, and with the CPI data in hand, I support another 75-basis point increase, bringing the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent before August.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

It implies a neutral stance as it highlights the need for further information before making any hawkish or dovish decisions."}, {"sentence": "If that data come in materially stronger than expected it would make me lean towards a larger hike at the July meeting to the extent it shows demand is not slowing down fast enough to get inflation down.Based on what we know about inflation today, I expect that further increases in the target range will be needed to make monetary policy restrictive, but that will depend on economic data in the coming weeks and months.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker indicates a willingness to consider a larger interest rate hike in July if the data shows strong demand and insufficient inflation reduction. However, they also acknowledge the need for further increases in the target range to make monetary policy restrictive, depending on future economic data."}, {"sentence": "Between the end of July and the FOMC's September meeting, we will get two employment and CPI reports with data for July and August.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the upcoming employment and CPI reports, covering July and August, will be crucial in shaping the FOMC's decision-making process. It implies a neutral stance as it highlights the importance of these reports without indicating a clear bias towards a hawkish or dovish monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I will be looking for signs that inflation has started its move down toward our 2 percent target on a sustained basis.I anticipate a decline in inflation will come as actual and anticipated hikes by the FOMC cool demand for products and labor, which will help demand and supply come into a better balance.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker is looking for signs of inflation decreasing towards the 2 percent target, indicating a desire to tighten monetary policy. They anticipate that the FOMC's rate hikes will cool demand, leading to a better balance between demand and supply."}, {"sentence": "The decline in the rate of inflation will also be assisted by continued improvement in goods supply bottlenecks, which is occurring in some sectors, and an increase in labor force participation, which is still significantly lower than it was before the pandemic.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a decline in inflation rate, improvement in goods supply bottlenecks, and lower labor force participation indicates that the FOMC expects continued accommodative measures to support economic recovery."}, {"sentence": "I hope these supply recoveries happen, but my expectations for policy don't rely on it.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The speaker expresses a desire for supply recoveries but indicates that their expectations for policy decisions are not dependent on it, implying that it may not significantly impact the direction of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I expect rate increases will continue after July at a pace that is dependent on the incoming data.After the July meeting, further increases will be restricting demand.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the speaker anticipates ongoing rate increases, dependent on incoming data, and implies that after the July meeting, these increases may start to restrict demand."}, {"sentence": "Looking further in the future, I will need to see how the tightening this year is affecting the economy and bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent target.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.

It indicates that the speaker anticipates a restrictive monetary policy until there is a sustained decrease in core PCE inflation, emphasizing the importance of controlling inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Food and energy prices tend to be volatile, so focusing on core PCE inflation is a good guide to inflation pressures in the near and medium term.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on core PCE inflation, indicating a cautious approach to assessing inflation pressures, considering the volatility of food and energy prices."}, {"sentence": "Importantly, as futures prices for commodities\u00e2\u0080\u0094food, energy, raw materials\u00e2\u0080\u0094have declined recently, I am expecting total PCE inflation to decline in coming months.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of declining futures prices for commodities and the expectation of a decline in total PCE inflation implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may consider implementing accommodative measures to stimulate the economy."}, {"sentence": "But until I see a significant moderation in core prices, I support further rate hikes.In talking about where monetary policy is headed, it is helpful to get a fix on where it is right now.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

The mention of a \"neutral\" interest rate and the expectation that the federal funds rate will be close to neutral after a 75-basis point increase indicates a balanced approach, neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "But some would argue that monetary policy is actually further away from neutral, based on the fact that current inflation is so much higher than the federal funds rate.In my view, that rests on a flawed idea of how monetary policy affects spending decisions.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It argues that the belief of monetary policy being further away from neutral due to high inflation is flawed, as it overlooks the impact of monetary policy on spending decisions."}, {"sentence": "That's because spending decisions that require borrowing are based on an outlook that extends several years.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that spending decisions, which are influenced by the outlook for several years, are important for US monetary policy. It implies a neutral stance as it does not explicitly indicate whether the outlook is hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant to the policy."}, {"sentence": "This means taking into consideration longer-term real rates, which are tied to the expected path of policy and inflation over the next several years.As a result, I think that estimates of the real federal funds rate should be based on the expected policy rate one to one and a half years in the future.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the importance of considering longer-term real rates tied to the expected path of policy and inflation.
