[{"sentence": "It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the National Association for Business Economics International Symposium: A Vision of the Economy Post COVID.1 So much has happened since we last met in Washington in February 2020, but I am grateful that technology is allowing us to gather once again, if only virtually.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications related to the stance of the Federal Reserve. It primarily focuses on the speaker's gratitude for the opportunity to gather virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic."}, {"sentence": "I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Ellen Zentner, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.Current Economic Situation and Outlook\r\nIn February 2020, none of us could have imagined that in a few short weeks the COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it would deliver the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Gross domestic product (GDP) collapsed by more than 30 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 2020; more than 22 million jobs were lost, wiping out a decade of employment gains; the unemployment rate rose from a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February to almost 15 percent in April; and inflation plummeted in response to a collapse in aggregate demand that dwarfed the contraction in aggregate supply.But with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the economy has proven to be much more resilient than many forecast or feared one year ago.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite the severe economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy has shown resilience. However, it does not provide a clear indication of the stance on US monetary policy. Therefore, its implications on US monetary policy are irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "With timely support from monetary and fiscal policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094unprecedented in both scale and scope\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the rapid development and deployment of several effective vaccines, the economy stabilized and began a robust recovery in the second half of 2020 that both we and outside forecasters expect to pick up steam this year.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the US monetary policy has been effective in stabilizing the economy and supporting its recovery. The mention of \"timely support from monetary and fiscal policy\" implies a neutral stance, as it acknowledges the positive impact of both policies. Additionally, the expectation of a robust recovery indicates a positive outlook, which can be seen as slightly hawkish."}, {"sentence": "So far, the economic activity data we have received this year is consistent with this outlook.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the economic activity data received so far aligns with the current outlook. As it does not provide any indication of a specific stance towards US monetary policy, it is considered irrelevant in determining whether the stance is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "For example, GDP rose by an impressive 6.4 percent in the first quarter, with real final sales to private domestic purchasers up an eye-popping 10.6 percent.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a strong economic growth in the US, indicating a hawkish stance on monetary policy. The impressive rise in GDP and real final sales implies a potential need for the Federal Reserve to adopt a more restrictive approach to prevent overheating, making it relevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Household spending on goods is rising robustly, and spending on services is also picking up as contact-intensive sectors begin to reopen and recover.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The robust rise in household spending on goods and the picking up of spending on services indicate a strong recovery in the economy, implying that the Federal Reserve may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Business and residential investment have more than fully recovered from the 2020 collapse and are operating above pre-pandemic levels.However, after looking at the details of Friday's disappointing employment report, the near-term outlook for the labor market appears to be more uncertain than the outlook for economic activity.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. While business and residential investment have rebounded strongly, the uncertain near-term outlook for the labor market indicates caution. It does not provide a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Employment remains 8.2 million below its pre-pandemic peak, and the true unemployment rate adjusted for participation is closer to 8.9 percent than to 6.1 percent.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of employment being significantly below pre-pandemic levels and the higher adjusted unemployment rate indicate a need for continued support and stimulus measures to address the ongoing economic challenges."}, {"sentence": "At the recent pace of payroll gains\u00e2\u0080\u0094roughly 500,000 per month over the past three months\u00e2\u0080\u0094it would take until August 2022 to restore employment to its pre-pandemic level.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The reference to the slow pace of payroll gains and the extended timeline to restore employment indicates a need for continued accommodative measures to support the economy, making it relevant for policymakers."}, {"sentence": "But what this necessary rebalancing of labor supply and demand means for wage and price dynamics will depend importantly on the pace of recovery in labor force participation as well as the extent to which there are post-pandemic mismatches between labor demand and supply in specific sectors of the economy and how long any such imbalances persist.Readings on inflation on a year-over-year basis have recently increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating later this year.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the pace of recovery in labor force participation and the presence of post-pandemic labor imbalances will play a crucial role in wage and price dynamics. Additionally, it acknowledges recent increases in inflation readings, which are expected to continue rising before eventually stabilizing. Overall, this statement is neutral in terms of US monetary policy as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Over the next few months, 12-month measures of inflation are expected to move above our 2 percent longer-run goal, largely reflecting, I believe, transitory factors such as a run of year-over-year comparisons with depressed service-sector prices recorded last spring as well as the emergence of some supply bottlenecks that may limit how quickly production can rebound in certain sectors.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The expectation of inflation moving above the 2 percent goal indicates a potential need for tightening measures to control inflationary pressures caused by transitory factors like supply bottlenecks and depressed service-sector prices."}, {"sentence": "However, under my baseline outlook, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on underlying inflation, and I expect inflation to return to\u00e2\u0080\u0094or perhaps run somewhat above\u00e2\u0080\u0094our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2022 and 2023.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) intends to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until specific labor market conditions are met and inflation reaches 2 percent. The mention of enhanced, outcome-based guidance for asset purchases further emphasizes a dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress, measured relative to the December 2020 announcement, has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of \"shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094not \"deviations.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence from the FOMC indicates a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The commitment to continue increasing holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities until substantial further progress is made towards maximum employment and price stability goals suggests a supportive and accommodative approach. The emphasis on \"shortfalls\" rather than \"deviations\" in the FOMC's estimates of employment levels further reinforces the dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "\"4 This language means that, going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that a low unemployment rate alone will not lead to a tightening of monetary policy unless there is evidence of inflationary risks from other indicators."}, {"sentence": "With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the challenge\u00e2\u0080\u0094of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC emphasizes the importance of keeping inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, indicating a commitment to maintaining price stability.

Chair Powell's indication of transitioning from \"flexible inflation targeting\" to a \"flexible form of average inflation targeting\" implies a more accommodative approach, aiming to allow inflation to run above target for some time, which aligns with a dovish monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "\"6 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0094maximum employment and price stability\u00e2\u0080\u0094that remain unchanged.7Concluding Remarks\r\nNotwithstanding the recent flow of encouraging macroeconomic data, the economy remains a long way from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy.
