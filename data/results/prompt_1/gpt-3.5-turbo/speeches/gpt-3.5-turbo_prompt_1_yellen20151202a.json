Therefore, it can be considered irrelevant in terms of influencing policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "In Laubach and Williams (2003), for example, the standard error of the estimate of the neutral rate in one baseline model was about 2 percentage points on average.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses a statistical estimation of the neutral rate in a specific model, without providing any indication of the FOMC's stance or implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Moreover, one-sided estimates of the neutral rate--those available to policymakers, based only on data known at the time--are generally noisier than estimates of the neutral rate at some previous time that incorporate all the data available.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that relying solely on one-sided estimates of the neutral rate, which are noisier, is less accurate compared to incorporating all available data from previous times. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it emphasizes the importance of comprehensive data analysis rather than leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}]
