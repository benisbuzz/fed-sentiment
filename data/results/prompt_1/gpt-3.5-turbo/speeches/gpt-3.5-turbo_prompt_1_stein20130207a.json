[{"sentence": "The question I'd like to address today is this: What factors lead to overheating episodes in credit markets?1 In other words, why do we periodically observe credit booms, times during which lending standards appear to become lax and which tend to be followed by low returns on credit instruments relative to other asset classes?2 We have seen how such episodes can sometimes have adverse effects on the financial system and the broader economy, and the hope would be that a better understanding of the causes can be helpful both in identifying emerging problems on a timely basis and in thinking about appropriate policy responses.Two Views of the Overheating Mechanism\r\nI will start by sketching two views that might be invoked to explain variation in the pricing of credit risk over time: a \"primitive preferences and beliefs\" view and an \"institutions, agency, and incentives\" view.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses two views on the pricing of credit risk over time.
