The reliance on studies analyzing interest rate drops after purchase announcements indicates a cautious and balanced stance, rather than a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "But such event studies may not be an ideal means to predict the consequences of reducing our portfolio, in part because the economic and financial environment will be very different, and also because event studies do not measure effects that develop or reverse over time.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that relying solely on event studies to predict the consequences of reducing the portfolio may not be ideal.
