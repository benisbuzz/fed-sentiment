It acknowledges the possibility of a surge in demand and temporary supply bottlenecks, which may cause PCE inflation to temporarily rise above 2 percent. However, it also indicates that these pressures are transitory, and the focus is on the entrenched inflation dynamics that will prevail after the reopening phase."}, {"sentence": "Underlying trend inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent for many years.9 In addition, research suggests that although increasing labor market tightness may show through to wage inflation, the pass-through to price inflation has become highly attenuated.10 These results suggest that businesses tend to respond to increased labor costs by reducing margins rather than increasing prices later in the cycle.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy.

The approach emphasizes patience in closing the gap between current conditions and the desired outcomes, focusing on eliminating shortfalls from maximum employment and achieving inflation averaging 2 percent over time. This implies a preference for a patient approach rather than a preemptive one."}, {"sentence": "The preemptive approach that calls for a reduction of accommodation when the unemployment rate nears estimates of its neutral rate in anticipation of high inflation risks an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many of the most economically vulnerable Americans and entrenching inflation persistently below its 2 percent target.11 Instead, the current approach calls for patience, enabling the labor market to continue to improve and inflation expectations to become re-anchored at 2 percent.One simple illustration of this difference is the way in which FOMC communications under the new framework have shifted market expectations around the conditions associated with the lift off of the policy rate from the lower bound.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current approach of the FOMC is more dovish, as it emphasizes patience and allowing the labor market to improve before considering a reduction in accommodation.
