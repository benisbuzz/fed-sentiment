[{"sentence": "When I was asked to participate on this panel in the middle of last year, the prevailing metaphor regarding Federal Reserve balance sheet policy was \"as boring as watching paint dry.\"", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the speaker's personal experience and the metaphor used to describe Federal Reserve balance sheet policy.

The mention of operating in a framework of ample reserves indicates a preference for maintaining a larger balance sheet, which is typically associated with a more accommodative monetary policy. The statement also implies that active management of the reserve supply is not necessary, further supporting the dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "The Federal Reserve controls the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates primarily through the use of administered rates, including the rate paid on reserve balances and the offered rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence implies that the Federal Reserve has a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the control of short-term interest rates through administered rates. This suggests a proactive approach to potentially raise rates to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "This regime is sometimes referred to as a floor system, because the administered rates place a floor under the rate at which banks and others will lend in the federal funds market.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence explains the concept of a floor system in monetary policy, which is irrelevant to the current stance of US monetary policy. It does not provide any indication of whether the policy is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "In adopting this framework, the Committee stated its intention to continue operating as it has for the past decade.The announcement was an important step in our normalization process.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the Committee intends to maintain a similar approach to US monetary policy as it has in the past decade.

It is neutral in terms of US monetary policy as it does not indicate a specific inclination towards being hawkish or dovish."}, {"sentence": "Before providing more context on those decisions, let me first provide a little more detail around our decision to remain in the current framework of ample reserves.The most important factor in the decision was that the current system has worked very well.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. It simply explains the decision to remain in the current framework of ample reserves based on its successful performance."}, {"sentence": "It has supported the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the mentioned action has been beneficial in attaining the Federal Reserve's goals of maximum employment and price stability. However, it does not provide any indication of whether the mentioned action is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "And it has shown itself to be flexible and well suited to maintaining interest rate control through various changes in money markets, bank regulation, and the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the mentioned approach has been effective in adapting to changes in money markets, bank regulation, and the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.

The Fed plans to maintain a larger balance sheet and reserve supply, indicating a commitment to accommodative measures. The goal of remaining on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve implies a neutral approach to managing reserves."}, {"sentence": "I would note that reserves have already declined appreciably from their peak, falling by $1.2 trillion to a current level of around $1.6 trillion.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The decline in reserves indicates a decrease in excess liquidity, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more accommodative approach to stimulate economic growth and maintain stability."}, {"sentence": "At the same time, we have seen a substantial increase in our nonreserve liabilities, such as currency in circulation and the Treasury General Account balance.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) towards interest rates or the economy.

These factors could have implications for US monetary policy, as they may influence the stance of the Federal Reserve. Therefore, it is relevant to the assessment of monetary policy and could be seen as a neutral statement."}, {"sentence": "As I have discussed previously, bank holdings of reserves to meet LCR requirements could shift toward Treasury securities, as aggregate reserves decline, without much upward pressure on the federal funds rate.5 That said, even if uncertain, it is probably safe to say that reserve demand is much higher than before the crisis.As we work to calibrate ample reserves, there are some tradeoffs that are worth noting.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the shift of bank holdings towards Treasury securities due to declining aggregate reserves would not significantly impact the federal funds rate. However, it acknowledges the uncertainty and emphasizes the importance of reserve demand. Overall, the sentence implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "For example, we could operate with a level of reserve balances at the lower end of what might be considered ample.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of operating with lower reserve balances indicates a willingness to provide ample liquidity, which aligns with a more accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "In that case, there would likely be occasions when unexpected declines in the supply of reserves or increases in the demand for reserves would require an open market operation to offset temporary upward pressures on the federal funds rate.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that unexpected declines in reserves or increases in demand may lead to temporary upward pressures on the federal funds rate, indicating a potential need for open market operations.

The speaker proposes operating between extremes, indicating a balanced approach. The mention of a sizable quantity of reserves to buffer against shocks implies a cautious and prudent approach, which aligns with a neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "On those few days when that buffer is likely to be exhausted, we could conduct open market operations to temporarily boost the supply of reserves.With so much uncertainty over the level and slope of the reserve demand curve, a degree of caution is warranted.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of conducting open market operations to boost reserves indicates a potential dovish approach to maintain liquidity. However, the caution expressed due to uncertainty implies a more neutral stance, as the Federal Reserve may adopt a wait-and-see approach before making any hawkish or dovish decisions."}, {"sentence": "As outlined in the minutes of the January FOMC meeting, the Committee has discussed ending the reduction in the Fed's aggregate asset holdings sometime in the latter half of this year, with still-ample reserves in the system.6 At that point, one option discussed, without any decision being made at this point, is to hold the level of total assets roughly fixed for a time.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC has discussed ending the reduction in the Fed's asset holdings and potentially maintaining the level of total assets for a period.

While the total size of the balance sheet remains fixed, the changing composition of liabilities indicates a gradual adjustment. The mention of currency demand growing in line with the economy implies a neutral approach towards monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Over time, the gradual increase in nonreserve liabilities would displace reserves as the overall balance sheet remains fixed.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The gradual increase in nonreserve liabilities displacing reserves implies a reduction in the size of the balance sheet, indicating a more accommodative approach to monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "This plan would substantially reduce the pace of the decline in reserves, allowing us to gradually approach our assessment of the appropriate amount of reserves for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The plan aims to slow down the decline in reserves, indicating a cautious approach towards reaching the optimal level of reserves for effective implementation of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Of course, in the longer run, once we reach our preferred level of reserves, the balance sheet would have to resume growth to match a continued increase in demand for nonreserve liabilities.I would like to wrap up with a brief discussion of some of the other decision points we will encounter as we continue the process of normalizing our balance sheet.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that once the preferred level of reserves is reached, the balance sheet would need to grow to meet the demand for nonreserve liabilities. The discussion of decision points in normalizing the balance sheet implies a cautious and balanced approach, neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "In particular, what does the Committee judge to be normal in regard to the type and duration of assets that we will hold?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance.

The speaker favors reducing the holdings of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to zero, indicating a desire to unwind the balance sheet and potentially tighten monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In those principles, we also state that while we do not expect sales of MBS as part of the normalization process, later we would be open to limited sales to reduce or eliminate residual holdings of MBS.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of being open to limited sales of MBS to reduce holdings implies a potential shift towards a hawkish approach in the future, but it is currently irrelevant as it does not pertain to the ongoing normalization process."}, {"sentence": "In regard to duration, moving to shorten the duration of our holdings could increase the Fed's ability to affect long-term interest rates if the need arose.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of shortening the duration of holdings implies a potential reduction in bond purchases, which could signal a tightening of monetary policy. This action aims to increase the Fed's influence on long-term interest rates, indicating a more restrictive approach."}, {"sentence": "However, it might be preferable to have the composition of our Treasury holdings roughly match the maturity composition of outstanding Treasury securities, minimizing any market distortions that could arise from our holdings.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The focus is on maintaining a balanced composition of Treasury holdings to minimize market distortions, indicating a cautious approach rather than a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Over the course of our upcoming meetings, I look forward to what promises to be an interesting discussion on these issues with my colleagues.Finally, in assessing our balance sheet policy, it is important to point out that the Fed remains entirely focused on meeting its statutory dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or stance on the direction of interest rates or the Fed's future actions. It simply expresses anticipation for a discussion and reiterates the Fed's commitment to its dual-mandate objectives."}, {"sentence": "The normalization of the balance sheet is not a competing goal.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the normalization of the balance sheet is not seen as a conflicting objective, indicating a cautious approach towards tightening monetary conditions."}, {"sentence": "If ever it appears that our plans for the balance sheet are running counter to the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives, we would quickly reassess our approach to the balance sheet.1.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC states that if their plans for the balance sheet hinder the achievement of their dual-mandate objectives, they would promptly reassess their approach. This indicates a willingness to adjust their strategy if necessary, without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it clarifies that the remarks expressed are personal opinions and not reflective of the official stance of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."}, {"sentence": "For more information, see the Committee's Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, which is available on the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides a link to the Committee's Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, without any indication of the content or implications of the statement."}, {"sentence": "The Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans were adopted on September 16, 2014, and can be found on the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_policynormalization.pdf.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about the adoption date and location of the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, without indicating any hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "The FOMC adopted addenda to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans on March 18, 2015 (PDF), and on June 13, 2017 (PDF).", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only mentions the adoption of addenda to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans on specific dates, without providing any information about the content or implications of those addenda."}, {"sentence": "The survey is available on the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sfos/files/senior-financial-officer-survey-201809.pdf.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides a link to a survey on the Board's website, without any indication of the content or implications for monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "See Randal K.
