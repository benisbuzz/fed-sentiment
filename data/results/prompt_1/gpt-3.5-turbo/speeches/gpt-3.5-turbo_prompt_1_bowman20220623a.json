[{"sentence": "Thank you to the Massachusetts Bankers Association for the opportunity to speak to you today.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). It is a courtesy expression acknowledging the opportunity to address the Massachusetts Bankers Association."}, {"sentence": "It is often good to get away from Washington to gain some perspective, and it's always worthwhile for me when I can get some perspective from bankers.I will touch on some of the banking issues I expect are on your minds, but one of the biggest issues for everyone right now is inflation, what the Fed is doing to get inflation under control, and the implications for your businesses, your customers, and your communities.Inflation is the highest we have seen in the United States in 40 years and so far it shows little sign of moderating.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any direct information or implications regarding the Fed's stance on inflation or its monetary policy. It focuses on the speaker's personal perspective and the importance of gaining insights from bankers, without addressing whether the Fed's approach is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "At the same time, the economy is growing at a moderate pace, and the labor market is extremely tight, as indicated by a variety of measures including reports of many employers unable to find workers despite significantly raising wages.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a growing economy and an extremely tight labor market, with employers struggling to find workers despite raising wages, indicates potential inflationary pressures. This could imply a need for tighter monetary policy to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "That tightness is contributing to inflation, because labor is the largest input cost for producing goods and providing services.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the tightness in the labor market is leading to inflationary pressures. It implies a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it highlights the need for measures to address inflation by potentially tightening monetary conditions."}, {"sentence": "Inflation is a significant challenge for everyone, but it hits lower- and moderate-income people the hardest, since they spend a larger share of their incomes on necessities and often have less savings to fall back on.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence highlights the impact of inflation on lower- and moderate-income individuals due to their higher expenditure on necessities and limited savings. Although it acknowledges the challenge, it does not provide a clear stance on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in terms of determining a hawkish, dovish, or neutral approach."}, {"sentence": "Inflation is also a burden for businesses that must somehow balance unpredictable costs while setting prices that aren't so high that they discourage customers from purchasing.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence highlights the challenges businesses face in managing inflationary pressures and pricing strategies. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it emphasizes the need for a balanced approach to avoid discouraging customer purchases. However, it does not directly indicate a specific stance on monetary policy, making it neutral in terms of its implications."}, {"sentence": "Inflation that continues at these levels is a threat to sustained employment growth and to the overall health of the economy.The inflation data show that, after moderating slightly for a short time, price increases for motor vehicles have picked up again, energy prices rose sharply in May, and prices for food have risen more than 10 percent from a year ago.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The concern over inflation levels being a threat to employment growth and the overall health of the economy indicates a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures. The specific mention of rising prices for motor vehicles, energy, and food further supports this hawkish view."}, {"sentence": "The inflationary effect from the invasion of Ukraine has proven to be lasting for both energy and food commodity prices, with little prospect of the conflict or those price pressures abating very soon.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the inflationary effect caused by the invasion of Ukraine has had a lasting impact on energy and food commodity prices. It implies a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates that the conflict and price pressures are unlikely to decrease in the near future."}, {"sentence": "More broadly, global supply chain issues continue, in part because of the effect of ongoing COVID-19 lockdown policies in China that have slowed production and shipping.One important factor that we often point to in driving today's spending decisions and inflation outlook are expectations of future inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses global supply chain issues and the impact of COVID-19 lockdown policies in China. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Near-term expectations tend to rise as current inflation increases, but when inflation expectations over the longer-term\u00e2\u0080\u0094the next 5 to 10 years\u00e2\u0080\u0094begin to rise, it may indicate that consumers and businesses have less confidence in the Fed's ability to address higher inflation and return it to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) goal of 2 percent.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that if inflation expectations over the longer-term start to rise, it could indicate a lack of confidence in the Fed's ability to control inflation. This could have implications on US monetary policy, potentially leading to a more dovish stance as the Fed tries to regain confidence and address higher inflation."}, {"sentence": "If expectations move significantly above our 2 percent goal, it would make it more difficult to change people's perceptions about the duration of high inflation and potentially more difficult to get inflation under control.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that if expectations of inflation surpass the 2 percent goal, it could be challenging to alter people's perception of prolonged high inflation and potentially harder to manage inflation effectively."}, {"sentence": "As we see surveys like the Michigan survey report higher longer-term inflation expectations, we need to pay close attention and continue to use our tools to address inflation before these indicators rise further or expectations of higher inflation become entrenched.As I mentioned earlier, one force driving inflation is the extremely tight labor market.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of higher longer-term inflation expectations and the need to address inflation before it rises further indicates a concern about inflationary pressures. Additionally, the reference to the tight labor market as a force driving inflation implies a need for proactive measures to control inflation."}, {"sentence": "The benefits from a tight labor market are easy to see\u00e2\u0080\u0094the U.S. economy continued to add jobs at a pace of 400,000 per month for the past three months, which is remarkable considering the low number of people looking for work.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The strong job growth in a tight labor market indicates a robust economy, which may lead to a potential increase in interest rates to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "Today, most people who want to work can find a job, and wages and salaries have risen faster than they have in decades.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it focuses on the current state of employment and wage growth. It does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance on interest rates or its monetary policy direction."}, {"sentence": "Even with these gains, wages have not kept pace with inflation, which has made it much more difficult for many workers to make ends meet in the face of soaring housing, energy, and food costs.Job creation signals strong labor market demand, particularly in the current environment, with a large number of available jobs and fewer job seekers.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Despite job creation indicating a strong labor market demand, the fact that wages have not kept pace with inflation implies that the Federal Reserve may prioritize supporting workers' financial well-being over tightening monetary policy to control inflation."}, {"sentence": "In addition, the tightness of the labor market is exacerbated by a labor force participation rate that remains far below the pre-pandemic benchmark, representing millions of workers sitting on the sidelines.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The reference to a tight labor market and low labor force participation rate indicates that there is still significant slack in the economy, making it irrelevant to consider tightening monetary policy at this time."}, {"sentence": "Many of these are early retirees, some incentivized to retire during the pandemic, and those with family caregiving challenges including very high costs for childcare.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the demographics of early retirees and their reasons for retiring, including challenges related to family caregiving and childcare costs."}, {"sentence": "While the strong job market has brought some of these workers back into the workforce, it seems that many are still waiting or may not return, meaning that labor shortages will likely persist in many sectors of the economy.I've laid out many of the challenges, so now let me talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing to get inflation under control.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses labor shortages and inflation control, but does not provide any indication of whether the Federal Reserve's actions are hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "In the face of inflation that continues to be much too high and in light of the recent high readings, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points at our most recent meeting last week.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC's decision to raise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points suggests a proactive approach to combat high inflation, reflecting a tightening monetary policy to curb rising prices."}, {"sentence": "That increase followed two rate hikes totaling 75 basis points earlier this year, and we indicated that further increases will likely be appropriate in the months ahead.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of previous rate hikes and the indication of further increases in the future imply a willingness to tighten monetary policy to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "On June 1, the Fed took a separate step to tighten monetary policy by beginning to reduce its large balance sheet of securities holdings.I strongly supported the FOMC's decision last week, and I expect to support additional rate increases until we see significant progress toward bringing inflation down.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker supports the Fed's decision to tighten monetary policy by reducing its balance sheet and expects to support further rate increases until inflation decreases significantly."}, {"sentence": "Based on current inflation readings, I expect that an additional rate increase of 75 basis points will be appropriate at our next meeting as well as increases of at least 50 basis points in the next few subsequent meetings, as long as the incoming data support them.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker expects further rate increases in the near future, based on current inflation readings and as long as incoming data continues to support them."}, {"sentence": "Depending on how the economy evolves, further increases in the target range for the federal funds rate may be needed after that.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that if the economy continues to improve, there may be a need for additional increases in the target range for the federal funds rate in the future."}, {"sentence": "The case for further rate hikes is made stronger by the current level of the \"real\" federal funds rate, which is the difference between the nominal rate and near-term inflation expectations.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the current level of the \"real\" federal funds rate, which considers inflation expectations, strengthens the argument for additional rate hikes."}, {"sentence": "With inflation much higher than the federal funds rate, the real federal funds rate is negative, even after our rate increases this year.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Despite rate increases, the real federal funds rate remains negative due to inflation surpassing the federal funds rate. This implies a need for accommodative measures to address the disparity and maintain a neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "Since inflation is unacceptably high, it doesn't make sense to have the nominal federal funds rate below near-term inflation expectations.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the current nominal federal funds rate should be increased to align with near-term inflation expectations, indicating a concern about high inflation levels."}, {"sentence": "I am therefore committed to a policy that will bring the real federal funds rate back into positive territory.While I expect that the labor market will remain strong as the FOMC continues to tighten monetary policy, these actions do not come without risk.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The commitment to bring the real federal funds rate into positive territory indicates a tightening policy. However, acknowledging the risks associated with these actions shows a neutral tone towards the potential consequences."}, {"sentence": "But in my view, our number one responsibility is to reduce inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the priority of reducing inflation. It implies that the speaker believes controlling inflation should be the primary focus, indicating a potential inclination towards tighter monetary measures."}, {"sentence": "Maintaining our commitment to restore price stability is the best course to support a sustainably strong labor market.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. By emphasizing the commitment to restore price stability, it implies a focus on controlling inflation. This approach aims to support a sustainably strong labor market, indicating a cautious and accommodative stance."}, {"sentence": "The Fed's credibility, earned over decades of low inflation, is a powerful policy tool that is critical to our long-term success.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the Fed's credibility, built through maintaining low inflation over many years, is an important factor in their long-term success. It implies a dovish stance as it emphasizes the significance of credibility as a policy tool for the Fed's monetary decisions."}, {"sentence": "If that credibility erodes, it must be re-earned.As a step toward that goal, I also supported the Committee's action to begin reducing the Fed's balance sheet, which is providing unneeded economic stimulus making inflation worse.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker emphasizes the importance of maintaining credibility and supports reducing the Fed's balance sheet to address the issue of unneeded economic stimulus and worsening inflation."}, {"sentence": "The current balance sheet is composed of Treasury securities and a significant amount of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about the composition of the current balance sheet, without indicating any implications or potential changes in the policy stance."}, {"sentence": "Since the longer-term goal of the balance sheet reduction plan includes a Treasuries-only balance sheet, it would make sense to eventually incorporate MBS sales into the plan so that reaching this goal does not take too long.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The implication is that incorporating Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) sales into the balance sheet reduction plan would expedite the process of achieving a Treasuries-only balance sheet, aligning with the longer-term goal."}, {"sentence": "My longer-term goal would be to get the Fed out of the business of indirectly intervening in the real estate market.In closing, I know that inflation, and our efforts to lower it, may present challenges for banks.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker's goal of removing the Fed's indirect intervention in the real estate market implies a desire for a more neutral approach. Additionally, the mention of inflation challenges for banks indicates a cautious approach, aligning with a dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "The first session on your agenda this morning discussed interest rate risk, and I would be interested to learn how you are managing this risk so far and what you expect as the year progresses.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is concerned about interest rate risk and wants to know how it is being managed. It implies a neutral stance as it does not explicitly indicate a preference for a hawkish or dovish approach to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Many of your sessions and speakers overlap with the Fed's work in supervision and much of what I'm focused on, including innovation and how best to use technology like AI and fintech to level the playing field for banks.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it primarily discusses the overlap between the speaker's sessions and the Fed's work in supervision, as well as their focus on innovation and technology in banking. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Attracting and retaining talent, along with succession planning, are absolutely critical for long-term sustainability.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it focuses on talent management and succession planning, which do not directly impact the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding interest rates or other monetary policy tools."}, {"sentence": "One other matter is the recently issued Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) proposed rule that would significantly change supervisory implementation and qualifying activities.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the recently issued Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) proposed rule, which pertains to supervisory implementation and qualifying activities, rather than the monetary policy stance."}, {"sentence": "I strongly encourage you to review this proposal and comment so that banks subject to the CRA understand the changes and will be able to continue to effectively serve their customers and communities.I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these issues, and I look forward to our discussion.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it focuses on encouraging banks to review a proposal related to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and seeking their comments. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}]
