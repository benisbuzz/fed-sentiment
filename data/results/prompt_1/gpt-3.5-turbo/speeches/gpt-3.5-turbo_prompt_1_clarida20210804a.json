[{"sentence": "Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy\r\nWith the release of the gross domestic product (GDP) data last week, we learned that the U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year transitioned from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expected\u00e2\u0080\u0094or even dared to hope\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the spring of last year that the recovery in GDP, from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the U.S. economy has transitioned from economic recovery to economic expansion, as indicated by the release of the GDP data.
