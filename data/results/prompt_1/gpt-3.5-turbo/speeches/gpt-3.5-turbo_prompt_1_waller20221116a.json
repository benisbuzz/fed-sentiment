[{"sentence": "Thank you, Dean Kadan, and thank you for the opportunity to speak today about the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for the Federal Reserve's ongoing fight to reduce inflation.I will begin with some comments on the overall outlook for economic growth and then try to explain how tighter monetary policy this year is intended to dampen demand and put downward pressure on inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the need for tighter monetary policy to reduce inflation and dampen demand, suggesting a willingness to raise interest rates or implement other measures to achieve these goals."}, {"sentence": "One way is by influencing the labor market, so next I will give an update about labor market conditions and how I expect them to evolve.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker intends to provide an update on labor market conditions and their expected evolution, indicating a focus on economic factors. As it does not directly indicate a preference for tighter or looser monetary policy, it can be considered neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I'll then turn to the outlook for inflation, where we saw moderation in some measures in October, but to a level that remains unacceptably high.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of moderation in inflation measures implies a cautious approach, indicating a potential need for accommodative measures. The concern about inflation remaining unacceptably high further supports a dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "I'll finish up with how I expect monetary policy will evolve in the coming months to reduce inflation and return it to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent goal.Economic growth in the United States has slowed significantly in 2022, and I expect that slow growth to continue into next year.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The expectation of slow growth and the intention to reduce inflation indicate a cautious approach by the FOMC, which aligns with a dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "After shrinking slightly in the first half of this year, real gross domestic product rebounded in the third quarter to a 2.6 percent annual growth rate.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a positive economic growth in the US, suggesting a potential shift towards a more hawkish stance on monetary policy. The rebound in real GDP implies a stronger economy, which may lead to a possibility of tightening monetary measures to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "But all indications are that this was a temporary boost, and that weak growth has returned in the last quarter of this year and will persist into 2023.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that despite a temporary boost, weak growth has returned and is expected to persist into 2023. This implies a need for accommodative measures to support the economy, making a hawkish stance irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Consumer and business spending has softened, amid deteriorating business sentiment in most sectors of the economy and near-record-low readings on surveys of consumer attitudes about the economy.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The softening of consumer and business spending, along with deteriorating business sentiment, indicates a weakening economy. Additionally, near-record-low readings on consumer attitudes imply a lack of confidence, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more accommodative or neutral approach."}, {"sentence": "There is no secret about why\u00e2\u0080\u0094inflation is very high, something people are reminded of every day when they see the prices of things they buy go up.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the reasons behind high inflation, without providing any indication of the FOMC's stance. It does not convey a hawkish, dovish, or neutral perspective on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "On top of that, higher interest rates are raising borrowing costs for businesses and households.At any other time, I would be pretty unhappy about slowing growth, but not now.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Despite the concern about slowing growth, the speaker's lack of unhappiness implies a willingness to tolerate it due to the current circumstances, possibly indicating a preference for maintaining lower interest rates to support businesses and households."}, {"sentence": "If you believe, as I do, that supply bottlenecks in the economy have mostly abated and that elevated inflation is primarily a function of high demand, then slowing down economic growth is absolutely necessary to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker believes that supply bottlenecks have diminished and high inflation is mainly due to strong demand. Therefore, they argue that slowing down economic growth is crucial to achieve the 2 percent inflation target."}, {"sentence": "This slowing in activity is a sign that actions taken by the Federal Reserve this year to reduce inflation are working.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to reduce inflation are effective, as evidenced by the slowing in activity. This implies that the Federal Reserve may continue with its current accommodative stance or even consider further easing measures."}, {"sentence": "Let me take a few minutes to explain how.The Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy to reduce inflation primarily by raising short-term interest rates, which has the effect of boosting interest rates throughout the economy.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it simply explains the mechanism through which the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy to reduce inflation. It does not provide any indication of whether the policy stance is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Higher borrowing costs curtail spending and investment by households and businesses.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that higher borrowing costs have a negative impact on spending and investment.

The FOMC's pivot in response to labor data and inflation indicates a shift towards tightening monetary policy. The significant increase in rates for 30-year fixed-rate home mortgages further supports this hawkish stance."}, {"sentence": "Rates for triple-B corporate bonds have roughly doubled in 2022, and rates on higher yield debt have increased even more.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The significant increase in rates for triple-B corporate bonds and higher yield debt indicates tightening financial conditions, which may prompt the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to consider a more restrictive monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "As a result, there is a slowdown in the volume of financing in most markets, with some effect on various prices.The sector that has seen the most significant slowing is housing.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a slowdown in financing and a significant impact on housing sector.

However, since it does not directly address US monetary policy, it is irrelevant to determining whether the statement is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Housing may be the first but won't be the last sector of the economy where higher interest rates will have the effect of dampening demand and will ultimately help moderate price increases.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that higher interest rates will be implemented to dampen demand in the housing sector, which will help moderate price increases. This indicates a tightening monetary policy to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Our goal is to rein in demand, bringing demand and supply into better balance, which will help reduce upward pressure on inflation.One sector where improving this balance will be crucial is the labor market.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

The mention of wages rising quickly implies potential inflationary pressures, which may prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to maintain their 2 percent inflation objective."}, {"sentence": "But I do see tentative signs of some cooling in the labor market, which is vital to keep rising labor costs from putting upward pressure on inflation.The employment report published November 4 showed that payrolls grew by 261,000 in October.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"cooling in the labor market\" implies a slowdown in job growth, which could alleviate concerns about rising labor costs and inflationary pressures. The employment report's positive payroll growth in October is irrelevant to this dovish sentiment."}, {"sentence": "This increase, while large, was a step down from the pace earlier this year, when payrolls grew an average of 539,000 per month in the first quarter, 340,000 per month in the second quarter and 381,000 per month in the third quarter.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.

It acknowledges the expectation of slower sales growth, which could be seen as dovish, but also mentions signs of a moderation in wage growth, which could be interpreted as hawkish. Overall, the sentence implies a cautious and balanced approach, making it irrelevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The 12-month increase in average hourly earnings continued to slow in October and the 3-month change continued to run lower than the 12-month rate, a promising signal of ongoing moderation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The slowing increase in average hourly earnings and the lower 3-month change compared to the 12-month rate indicate a moderation in economic activity, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to maintain or even ease its current monetary policy stance."}, {"sentence": "Wage growth has been a contributing factor to inflation, especially in the service sector, so it is important to get the labor market into better balance to bring future wage growth down to a more sustainable level that will assist in moving overall inflation lower.Let me now turn to the outlook for inflation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy.

However, the decrease is not significant enough to be considered a major shift, so it can be considered relatively neutral."}, {"sentence": "Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, increased 0.3 percent in October from September, a marked step-down from the 0.6 percent readings in the previous two months and the average of 0.5 percent over the first nine months of 2022.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy.

The decline from the previous month implies a potential easing of inflationary pressures, which may influence the Federal Reserve to adopt a more accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "The step down in October was widespread, involving both a deceleration in services prices and the first decline in core goods prices since March.Though welcome news, we must be cautious about reading too much into one inflation report.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a step down in October, deceleration in services prices, and decline in core goods prices indicates a potential slowdown in inflation.

By focusing on core inflation (excluding volatile factors), the speaker believes it provides a more accurate indication of future inflation. This implies a preference for tightening monetary policy to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "This increase is much improved from the past several months but still very far from our 2 percent target.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy.

It only emphasizes the importance of previous decisions and acknowledges the time lags in the impact of monetary policy on economic activity and inflation."}, {"sentence": "In my view, the Committee will reach the terminal rate well before inflation reaches 2 percent because of the abundance of evidence that it takes months, and perhaps even longer, for the full effects of a rate increase to work through the economy.Considering the cumulative effect of tightening and the likely lags for policy doesn't mean these factors are more important than new information about the economy.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker believes that the Committee will reach the terminal rate (the highest level of interest rates in a tightening cycle) before inflation reaches 2 percent.

The mention of new information about the economy implies a neutral stance, as it suggests that such information could influence policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "On the contrary, new data, especially on inflation, are much more important now, well into the tightening cycle, than when the only direction for the federal funds rate to go was up\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and up by a lot.I am going to take a considerable risk here and employ an airplane simile to illustrate how I think of our past policy actions and where we are going.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of new data, particularly on inflation, during the tightening cycle.
