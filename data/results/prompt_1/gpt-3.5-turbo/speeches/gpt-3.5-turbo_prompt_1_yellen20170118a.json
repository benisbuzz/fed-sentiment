It discusses the observation of slower technological progress and diffusion, which does not indicate a specific monetary policy stance such as hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Others look at college graduation rates, which have flattened out after rising rapidly in previous generations.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses college graduation rates, which do not directly impact the decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding interest rates or other monetary policy tools."}, {"sentence": "And still others focus on a dramatic slowing in the creation of new businesses, which are often more innovative than established firms.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the slowing creation of new businesses and their innovation, without directly addressing the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) towards interest rates or monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "While each of these factors has likely played a role in slowing productivity growth, the extent to which they will continue to do so is an open question.2Why does slow productivity growth, if it persists, imply a lower neutral interest rate?", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the factors contributing to slowing productivity growth but states uncertainty about their future impact. The implication is that slow productivity growth could potentially lead to a lower neutral interest rate, making it relevant to monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "First, it implies that the economy's usual rate of output growth, when employment is at its maximum and prices are stable, will be significantly slower than the post-World War II average.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy.

This aligns with a policy aimed at stimulating economic growth and stability."}, {"sentence": "Because interest rates are the mechanism that brings the supply of savings and the demand for investment funds into balance, more saving and less investment imply a lower neutral interest rate.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that when there is an increase in saving and a decrease in investment, it leads to a lower neutral interest rate.

The mention of the longer-run neutral rate being a full percentage point lower than the previous estimate indicates a more accommodative approach, potentially implying a willingness to keep interest rates lower for longer."}, {"sentence": "If you are a borrower, it means that, although the interest rates you pay on, say, your auto loan or mortgage or credit card likely will creep higher, they probably will not increase dramatically.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.
