It is neutral as it does not provide any specific indication of a hawkish or dovish stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "From th at standpoint , the current picture is plain to see:  The labor market  is very strong, and inflation is much too high.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a \"very strong\" labor market implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent potential overheating. Additionally, the statement about \"inflation being much too high\" further supports a hawkish approach, indicating a potential inclination towards raising interest rates to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "My colleagues and I are ac utely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially o n those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence reflects a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC members acknowledge the negative impact of high inflation on vulnerable individuals, indicating a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy to avoid exacerbating hardships."}, {"sentence": "There is an obvious need to move expedit iously to  return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if  that is what is required to restore price stability.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the need to promptly transition from an accommodative stance to a more neutral level, and potentially even to more restrictive levels, to ensure price stability."}, {"sentence": "We are committed to restoring price stability while preserving a strong labor market.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The commitment to restoring price stability indicates a hawkish approach, while the emphasis on preserving a strong labor market reflects a dovish perspective. Overall, it implies a balanced approach to maintain both aspects, making it a neutral statement."}, {"sentence": "At our meeting that  concluded last week, we took several steps in pursuit of these goals:  We raised our policy in terest rate for the first time since the start of the pandemic and said  that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate  to reach our objectives.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the policy interest rate for the first time since the pandemic began and expressed the anticipation of further rate increases to achieve their objectives."}, {"sentence": "We also said  that we expect to  begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming mee ting.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of reducing the size of the balance sheet indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a hawkish approach focused on controlling inflation and potentially raising interest rates."}, {"sentence": "In my press conference, I noted that  action  could come as soon as our next meeting in May , though that is not a decision that we  have made.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates the possibility of taking action in the near future, specifically in May. However, it also emphasizes that no decision has been made yet, which slightly neutralizes the overall tone."}, {"sentence": "These actions, along with the adjustments we have made since last fall, represent a substantial firming in the stance of policy with the intention of restoring price stability.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"substantial firming\" and the intention to restore price stability indicate a tightening of policy to combat inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "In my comments today, I will first discuss the economic conditions that warran t these actions and then address th e path ahead for monetary policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker will analyze economic conditions and the future direction of monetary policy.

However, since it does not provide any indication of the current or future stance on monetary policy, it is irrelevant to assessing the implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We seek to foster another long expansion in order to realize those benefits again.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The focus on fostering another long expansion implies a desire to maintain accommodative measures to support economic growth, indicating a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The labor market has substantial momentum.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the labor market in the US is strong and gaining momentum. It implies a positive outlook on the economy, which could be seen as a hawkish signal for US monetary policy, indicating a potential inclination towards tightening measures."}, {"sentence": "Employment growth powered through the  difficul t Omicron wave, adding 1.75 million jobs over the past three months.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a positive trend in employment growth despite the challenges posed by the Omicron wave. It suggests a potentially hawkish implication on US monetary policy, as strong employment growth may lead to a more aggressive approach in tightening monetary measures to prevent overheating of the economy."}, {"sentence": "The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent,  near historic al lows, and ha s reached this level much faster than anticipated by most forecasters (figure 1) .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The rapid decline in the unemployment rate, reaching historic lows faster than expected, indicates a strong labor market. This may lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth and maintain price stability."}, {"sentence": "While disparities in emplo yment remain, j ob growth has been widespread across racial, ethnic, and demographic  groups .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that job growth has been widespread across different groups, indicating a positive trend in employment.

The tight labor market implies a potential need for tighter monetary policy measures to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "There are far  more job openings  going unfilled  today than before  the pandemic , despite today\u2019s  unemployment rate being higher.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The high number of job openings going unfilled despite a higher unemployment rate indicates a potential labor market mismatch. This could influence policymakers to maintain accommodative measures to support job creation and economic recovery."}, {"sentence": "I ndeed, there  are a record 1.7 posted job openings for each person who is looking for wor k.  R ecord numbers of people are quitting jobs each month, typically to take another job with higher pay.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a tight labor market with high demand for workers, indicated by the record number of job openings and people quitting jobs for better pay.

The fact that nominal wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, particularly for lower-wage workers, indicates a strong economy. This may lead to concerns about inflationary pressures, potentially prompting the Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish approach to monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "It is worth considering why the  labor market is so tight,  given that the unemployment rate  is actually higher than it was before the pandemic .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Despite the higher unemployment rate, the tight labor market raises concerns. This implies that the Federal Reserve may prioritize supporting the labor market over tightening monetary policy in the near term."}, {"sentence": "One explanation is that the natural rate of unemployment may be  temporarily elevated, so wage pressure is greater  for a ny given level of unemployment.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the current elevated natural rate of unemployment may lead to increased wage pressure, indicating a need for accommodative measures to support the labor market and stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "The sheer volume of hiring may have  - 3 -  taxed the capacity of the market to bring workers and jobs together.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the high level of hiring might have strained the ability of the market to match workers with available jobs.

It implies that as the mentioned factors fade, there will be reduced pressure in the job market, indicating a potential need for accommodative measures to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "A second source of l abor market tightness is  that the  labor force participation rate dropped sharply in the pandemic and has only partly recovered.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the drop in the labor force participation rate during the pandemic has contributed to labor market tightness. It implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it highlights the need for further recovery in the labor market before considering any hawkish measures."}, {"sentence": "As  a result, the labor force remains below its pre -pandemic trend (figure  3).", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the labor force is still below its pre-pandemic trend, indicating a potential weakness in the economy. This could have implications on US monetary policy, as it may influence the Federal Reserve to adopt a dovish stance to support economic recovery."}, {"sentence": "Total demand for labor , measured by total employ ment plus posted job openings, has  substantially recovered  and far exceed s the size of the workforce .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The substantial recovery in total demand for labor, surpassing the size of the workforce, indicates a tightening labor market. This could imply a need for a more restrictive monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "About half of th e shortfall in labor force participation is  attributable to retirements during the pandemic.1  History suggests that most of those reti rees are unlikely to reenter the workforce .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the impact of retirements on labor force participation during the pandemic. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Increases in l abor force participation  often  substantially lag declines in unemployment .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence implies that increases in labor force participation tend to occur at a slower pace compared to declines in unemployment. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it suggests a potentially dovish stance, indicating that the Federal Reserve may prioritize reducing unemployment over tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Overall, the labor market is strong but showing a clear imbalance of supply and demand.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. While acknowledging a strong labor market, it highlights an imbalance between supply and demand. However, it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance towards monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Our monetary policy tools cannot help with labor supply in the near term , but in a long expansion, the factors holding back supply wi ll likely ease .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. While acknowledging that monetary policy tools cannot address labor supply in the near term, it anticipates that the factors hindering supply will likely ease during a long expansion. Therefore, it does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish approach and is irrelevant to immediate policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "In the meantime, we aim to use our tools to moderate demand growth, thereby facilitating continued, sustainable increases in employment and wages.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The use of tools to moderate demand growth indicates a cautious approach to balance employment and wages, without leaning towards a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "1 See the discussion of labor force participation in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), Monetary Policy Report  (Washington:  Board of Governors, February),  https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20220225_mprfullreport.pdf .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence refers to a specific discussion on labor force participation in the Monetary Policy Report by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

The mention of a significant deterioration in the inflation outlook indicates a concern for low inflation, which may prompt the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to adopt a more accommodative stance to stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "The rise in i nflation has been much greater and more persistent than forecasters generally  expected.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish tone as it indicates that inflation has exceeded expectations and has been persistent. This could imply that the FOMC may consider adopting a more aggressive stance on monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "For example, at the time of our June 2021 meeting, every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  participant and all but one of 35 submissions in the Survey of Professional Forecasters predicted that 2021 inflation would be below 4 percent .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence indicates a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The unanimous prediction of FOMC participants and the majority of submissions in the Survey of Professional Forecasters suggesting inflation below 4 percent implies a cautious approach towards tightening monetary measures, reflecting a preference for maintaining accommodative policies."}, {"sentence": "Inflation came in at 5.5 percent.2  For a time, moderate inflation forecast s looked plaus ible\u2014the one -month headline and core inflation rate s declined steadily from April  through September .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of moderate inflation forecasts and the decline in headline and core inflation rates indicate a favorable outlook. This could imply that the Federal Open Market Committee may maintain or even ease its current accommodative stance."}, {"sentence": "But inflation moved up sharply in the fall, and , just since our December meeting , the median FOMC projection for year -end 2022 jumped from 2.6 percent to 4.3 percent.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish shift in US monetary policy. The significant increase in inflation and the upward revision of the FOMC projection for year-end 2022 indicate a more aggressive stance towards tightening monetary measures to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Why have forecasts been so far off?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. It simply questions the accuracy of forecasts, which does not directly impact monetary policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "In my view, an important part of the explanation is that forecasters widely underestimat ed the severity and persistence of supply- side frictions , which, when combined with strong demand, especia lly for durable goods, produced surprisingly high inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the forecasters' underestimation of supply-side frictions, along with strong demand for durable goods, led to unexpectedly high inflation. It implies a hawkish stance as it highlights the need for a potentially tighter monetary policy to address the inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "The pandemic  and the associated shutdown and reopening of the economy caused a serious upheaval in many parts  of the economy, snarling supply chains, constraining labor supply, and creating a major boom in demand for goods and a bust in s ervices demand.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the pandemic and its effects have had a significant impact on various aspects of the economy, leading to disruptions in supply chains and labor supply, as well as a surge in demand for goods but a decline in demand for services. However, it does not provide a clear indication of the stance on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in terms of its implications."}, {"sentence": "The combination of the surge in goods demand with  supply chain bottlenecks  2 This is headline personal consumption expenditures inflation on a Q4/Q4 basis.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses a specific measure of inflation, without providing any indication of the FOMC's stance on interest rates or its implications for monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The Survey of Professional Forecasters statistic is a count by the authors using the second quarter 2021 survey.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it merely provides information about the methodology used to conduct the Survey of Professional Forecasters.

However, without further context or information, it is difficult to determine whether these implications would be hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Prices soared  across the vehicles sector as b ooming demand was met by a sharp decline in global production during the summer of 2021, owing to shortages of computer chips .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests a potential inflationary pressure in the vehicles sector due to a combination of high demand and reduced global production caused by computer chip shortages. However, without further context, it is irrelevant to determine its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Production remains below pre -pandemic levels, and an expected sharp decline in prices has been repeated ly postponed.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The fact that production is still below pre-pandemic levels indicates a weak economy, while the repeated postponement of a sharp decline in prices implies a lack of inflationary pressure. Therefore, it implies that the Federal Reserve may maintain a neutral or accommodative stance to support economic recovery."}, {"sentence": "Many  forecasters, including FOMC participants , had been expecting inflation to cool in the second half of last year, as the economy started going back to normal after vaccines became widely  available.3  Expectations were that the supply- side damage would begin to heal.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that forecasters, including FOMC participants, anticipated a decrease in inflation and the healing of supply-side damage as the economy returned to normal after widespread vaccine availability."}, {"sentence": "Schools would reopen\u2014freeing parents to return to work\u2014and labor supply would begin bouncing back, kinks in supply chains would begin resolving, and consumption would start rotating back to services, all of which could reduce price pressures.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that as schools reopen and labor supply improves, supply chain issues are resolved, and consumption shifts back to services, there could be a reduction in price pressures. This indicates a potential easing of inflationary concerns, aligning with a dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "While schools are open,  none of the  other expectations has  been fully met .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications related to the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). It focuses on the status of schools and other expectations, but does not address monetary policy or its implications."}, {"sentence": "In fact, we are now headed once again into more COVID- related supply disruptions from China.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses COVID-related supply disruptions from China, which does not directly impact the monetary policy stance of the US."}, {"sentence": "It continues to seem likely that hoped- for supply- side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but  the timing and scope of that r elief are highly uncertain.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the possibility of supply-side healing in the future, but highlights the uncertainty surrounding its timing and scope. Therefore, it does not provide a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish stance, making it irrelevant for immediate policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "In the meantime,  as we set policy , we will be looking to actual  progress on these issues and not assuming  significant near -term supply -side relief.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will focus on real progress regarding certain issues, rather than assuming immediate relief from supply-side factors."}, {"sentence": "The P olicy Response As the magnitude  and persistence of the increase in inflation  became increasingly clear  over the second half of last year , and as the job market recovery accelerated beyond  3 See the minutes  of the June 2021 FOMC meeting, which are available on the Board\u2019s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides a reference to the minutes of the June 2021 FOMC meeting without directly discussing any hawkish, dovish, or neutral implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "- 6 -  expectations , the FOMC pivoted to progressively less accommodative monetary policy.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC has shifted its stance from being accommodative to less accommodative, indicating a move towards a more hawkish monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In June, the median FOMC parti cipant projected that the federal funds rate would remain at its effective lower bound through the end of 2022, and as the news came in, the projected policy paths shifted higher  (figure 5) .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The projection of the federal funds rate remaining at its effective lower bound through the end of 2022 indicates a cautious approach.
