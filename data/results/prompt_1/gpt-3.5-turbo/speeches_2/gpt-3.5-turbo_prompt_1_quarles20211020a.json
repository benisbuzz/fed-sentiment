The speaker acknowledges that inflation above 4 percent cannot be considered moderately above the 2 percent target. They raise concerns about the threshold of \"How high is too high?\" indicating a need for tighter monetary measures to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Moreover, the two questions are obviously related: we can tolerate inflation of 2.5 percent as supply returns to normal without dramatically affecting inflation expectations, for a much longer period than we can tolerate inflation of 4.5 percent.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to tolerate a higher inflation rate of 2.5 percent for a longer period, while a higher inflation rate of 4.5 percent is less tolerable. This implies a preference for tighter monetary policy to control inflation."}, {"sentence": "I cannot speak for my FOMC colleagues on this issue, but I will conclude with some thoughts of my own.In 2012, the FOMC formally adopted a longer-run inflation target of 2 percent, and since then, that target has been reaffirmed annually by the Committee including in our new framework adopted in August 2020.5 The key innovations in the new framework relative to the previous incarnation are designed primarily to address the risk that inflation and inflation expectations could settle below our 2 percent target.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the stance or direction of the policy.

It acknowledges the risk of longer-run changes in the economy reducing the equilibrium federal funds rate, indicating a need for accommodative measures to support economic activity."}, {"sentence": "In turn, a lower average level of interest rates would make it more difficult, on balance, for the Federal Reserve to respond to negative shocks to the economy with sizable cuts to interest rates.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that a lower average level of interest rates would limit the Federal Reserve's ability to respond to economic downturns with significant interest rate cuts, indicating a less accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "The inability to cut interest rates sufficiently can then reinforce downward pressures on inflation such that it begins to run persistently below the FOMC's 2 percent goal and causes inflation expectations to fall with it.As is well known by now, those revisions to the Fed's monetary policy framework put new emphasis on reaching maximum employment and introduced new flexibility in how to account for progress toward our price-stability goal by seeking inflation that averages 2 percent over time to ensure longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored at this level.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the inability to cut interest rates enough can lead to persistent low inflation and falling inflation expectations.

It implies that the Federal Reserve is willing to provide more support for economic activity to prevent inflation from falling below 2 percent.

It implies that the current high inflation rates do not pose a significant challenge to the new framework or any other reasonable frameworks for conducting monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "As I said earlier, when our price-stability and employment goals are not complementary, the framework calls for policy to depend on the remaining shortfall from our maximum-employment goal, on the extent to which inflation continues to exceed 2 percent, and on the amount of time we expect it will take for employment and inflation to meet our goals.I remain quite optimistic about the capacity and willingness of consumers and businesses to power a robust expansion as we put the COVID event behind us, even with the headwinds coming from the supply side.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker expresses optimism about the capacity and willingness of consumers and businesses to drive economic growth, despite headwinds from the supply side.
