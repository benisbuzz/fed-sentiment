[{"sentence": "I look forward to my conversation with Steve Liesman and to your questions, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.Current Economic Situation and Outlook\r\nIn the second quarter of last year, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it primarily discusses the current economic situation and outlook, rather than providing any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Economic activity rebounded robustly in the third quarter and has continued to recover in the fourth quarter from its depressed second-quarter level, though the pace of improvement has moderated.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive trend in economic activity, indicating a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. However, the mention of a moderated pace of improvement implies a more neutral approach, as the Federal Open Market Committee may be cautious about potential risks and uncertainties in the future."}, {"sentence": "Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level, supported in part by federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The strong household spending on goods, driven by federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, indicates a robust economic recovery. This may imply that the Federal Reserve could consider tightening monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "In contrast, spending on services remains well below pre-pandemic levels, particularly in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The mention of spending on services being well below pre-pandemic levels indicates a weak economic recovery, which may warrant continued accommodative measures by the Federal Reserve to support the struggling sectors like travel and hospitality."}, {"sentence": "In the labor market, more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained, as many people were able to return to work.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive development in the labor market, indicating a potential improvement in the US economy. However, it does not directly address the stance of US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Inflation, following large declines in the spring of 2020, picked up over the summer but has leveled out more recently; for those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, price increases remain subdued.While gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter downshifted from the once-in-a-century 33 percent annualized rate of growth reported in the third quarter, it is clear that since the spring of 2020, the economy has turned out to be more resilient in adapting to the virus, and more responsive to monetary and fiscal policy support, than many predicted.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that inflation has stabilized recently after increasing during the summer, but price increases in sectors affected by the pandemic are still low. Additionally, it highlights that the economy has shown resilience and responsiveness to monetary and fiscal policy support since the spring of 2020. Overall, this information is neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Indeed, it is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) summarized in the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), most of my colleagues and I revised up our outlook for the economy over the medium term, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2 In particular, the median FOMC participant projects that by the end of 2023\u00e2\u0080\u0094a little less than three years from now\u00e2\u0080\u0094the unemployment rate will have fallen below 4 percent, and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC participants have revised up their outlook for the economy, projecting a relatively rapid return to employment and inflation levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate. This indicates a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy in the future."}, {"sentence": "Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.While the recent surge in new COVID cases and hospitalizations is cause for concern and a source of downside risk to the very near-term outlook, the welcome news on the development of several effective vaccines indicates to me that the prospects for the economy in 2021 and beyond have brightened and the downside risk to the outlook has diminished.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a more hawkish stance on US monetary policy. Despite concerns about the recent surge in COVID cases, the positive news on vaccine development indicates a brighter economic outlook, reducing the downside risk. This implies a potential shift towards a less accommodative monetary policy in the future."}, {"sentence": "The two new SEP charts that we released for the first time following the December FOMC meeting speak to these issues by providing information on how the risks and uncertainties that surround the modal or baseline projections have evolved over time.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the release of new SEP charts and the evolution of risks and uncertainties surrounding projections. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "While nearly all participants continued to judge that the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated, fewer participants saw the balance of risks as weighted to the downside than in September.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a shift in the perception of risks among FOMC participants. It indicates a less pessimistic view compared to September, which could be seen as a dovish signal for US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Although a little more than half of participants judged risks to be broadly balanced for economic activity, a similar number continued to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation.The Latest FOMC Decision and the New Monetary Policy Framework \r\nAt our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Although risks for economic activity are seen as broadly balanced, the fact that a similar number of participants still perceive risks weighted to the downside for inflation indicates a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "As announced in the September statement and reiterated in November and December, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.3 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as our maximum-employment mandate\u00e2\u0080\u0094are achieved.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC aims to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, indicating a commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy until both inflation and maximum employment goals are achieved."}, {"sentence": "We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.In addition, in the December statement, we combined our forward guidance for the federal fund rate with enhanced, outcome-based guidance about our asset purchases.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) intends to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until specific labor market conditions are met and inflation reaches 2 percent. The mention of enhanced, outcome-based guidance for asset purchases further emphasizes a dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.The changes to the policy statement that we made over the fall bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August.4 In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of \"shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094not \"deviations.\"", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC will continue to pursue an expansionary monetary policy by increasing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. It indicates a dovish stance as the FOMC plans to maintain these purchases until substantial progress is made towards its employment and price stability goals. The reference to the new framework aligns with the dovish approach, emphasizing the focus on employment shortfalls rather than deviations."}, {"sentence": "This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that a low unemployment rate alone will not lead to a tightening of monetary policy unless there is evidence of inflationary risks from other indicators."}, {"sentence": "With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importance\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the challenge\u00e2\u0080\u0094of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC acknowledges the challenge of maintaining inflation expectations at 2 percent due to the effective-lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate during downturns, indicating a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it \"seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,\" and\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the same sentence\u00e2\u0080\u0094that therefore \"following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\"", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC aims to anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent and is willing to tolerate inflation moderately above 2 percent for a period after persistent inflation below 2 percent. This indicates a willingness to support accommodative monetary policy to stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from \"flexible inflation targeting\" to \"flexible average inflation targeting.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the US monetary policy is shifting from a \"flexible inflation targeting\" approach to a \"flexible average inflation targeting\" framework. This indicates a dovish stance as it implies a willingness to tolerate higher inflation temporarily to achieve long-term average inflation targets."}, {"sentence": "\"5 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0094maximum employment and price stability\u00e2\u0080\u0094which remain unchanged.6Concluding Remarks\r\nWhile our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevailed at the business cycle peak reached last February.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current monetary policy strategy is in line with the dual-mandate goals of the Federal Reserve, which are maximum employment and price stability. It acknowledges the support provided by interest rate and balance sheet tools, but also highlights the need for time to fully recover economic activity and employment. The sentence is neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help ensure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The use of phrases like \"committed to using our full range of tools\" and \"support the economy\" indicates a willingness to take accommodative measures to stimulate economic growth and ensure a strong recovery."}, {"sentence": "The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other Federal Reserve Board members or Federal Open Market Committee participants.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it simply states that the views expressed belong to the individual and may not represent the opinions of other members or participants. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The most recent SEP is available on the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides a link to access the most recent SEP (Summary of Economic Projections) on the Board's website. It does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of monetary policy, whether hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "See the FOMC statements issued after the September, November, and December meetings, which are available (along with other postmeeting statements) on the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information on where to find FOMC statements from previous meetings. It does not indicate any hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The statement is available on the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant as it only provides a link to the FOMC statement on the Board's website, without any specific information or implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "See Jerome H. Powell (2020), \"New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,\" speech delivered at \"Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for Monetary Policy,\" a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about a speech delivered by Jerome H. Powell at a symposium. It does not indicate any specific stance or implications on the monetary policy, making it unrelated to the classification of hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "See Richard H. Clarida (2020), \"The Federal Reserve's New Monetary Policy Framework: A Robust Evolution,\" speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington (via webcast), August 31; and Richard H.
