It implies that as the economy approaches full employment (reduced slack), economic growth is expected to slow down (moderate).

It emphasizes the importance of slowing down economic growth to match the rate of increase in productive capacity, in order to sustain the expansion without causing inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "In my testimony to the Congress in July, as part of the Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report, I noted that the U.S. economy had entered this transition phase, and that some moderation of economic growth over the remainder of the year seemed likely.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.
