It implies that tight labor markets do not necessarily lead to negative consequences like increased leverage or asset bubbles, indicating a more relaxed approach towards interest rates and monetary tightening."}, {"sentence": "These individual projections are published quarterly in the Summary of Economic Projections that accompanies the release of the minutes from the March, June, September and December meetings of the FOMC.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it simply explains the frequency and publication of individual projections in the Summary of Economic Projections.

This implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it indicates a similarity in approach rather than a clear indication of being hawkish or dovish."}, {"sentence": "However, while the Committee publishes participants' projections--including policy paths--in the SEP, it does not publish a \"consensus\" forecast, in contrast to some other central banks.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the publication practices of the Committee rather than indicating any stance on interest rates or economic outlook.

It simply states that the rule embodies key principles that central banks consider when setting policy, without indicating whether it leans towards a hawkish, dovish, or neutral approach."}, {"sentence": "First, a persistent movement in inflation requires a more than one-for-one response of the policy rate to stabilize inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.
