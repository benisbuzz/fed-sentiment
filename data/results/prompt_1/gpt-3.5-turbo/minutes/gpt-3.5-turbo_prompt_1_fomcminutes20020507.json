As it does not provide a clear indication of the stance on US monetary policy, it is irrelevant in determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "A pause in the expansion was not an unusual development during the early stages of a cyclical recovery, and the members generally viewed a pickup in growth as a reasonable expectation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.
