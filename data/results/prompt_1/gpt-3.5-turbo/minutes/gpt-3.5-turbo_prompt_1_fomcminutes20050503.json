Although there are signs of increased inflation pressures and pricing power, the mention of well-contained longer-term inflation expectations implies that the FOMC may not be overly concerned about immediate inflationary risks."}, {"sentence": "Interest rates           rose further the next day following the release of a larger-than-expected           increase in the CPI for February.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of interest rates rising further indicates a tightening monetary policy response to the larger-than-expected increase in the CPI, reflecting a more aggressive approach to control inflation."}, {"sentence": "Over subsequent weeks, however, these           increases were more than reversed by weaker-than-expected data on consumer           spending, consumer sentiment, and output.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the initial increases in US monetary policy were reversed due to disappointing data on consumer spending, sentiment, and output.

The rise of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, driven by disappointing news on employment and output abroad, may prompt the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to adopt a more accommodative stance to support the US economy."}, {"sentence": "The growth of M2 continued to be restrained by           increases in its opportunity cost resulting from rising short-term interest           rates.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

It acknowledges that recent inflation readings may have been influenced by pass-through effects from higher energy costs, indicating a potential temporary factor.
