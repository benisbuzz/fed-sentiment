It implies a dovish stance as the speaker is cautious about the progress made by the FOMC and the potential impact on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I\u2019m not the only one whose outlook has shifted.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that there has been a change in outlook among multiple individuals, indicating a shift in sentiment. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this shift is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Since the end of January, f inancial market  participant s have revised their outlooks  in a way that has led them to  mark up their  expectations for the federal funds rate at the end of 2023 by about a half percentage point.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish shift in US monetary policy. The fact that financial market participants have revised their outlooks and increased their expectations for the federal funds rate indicates a more aggressive stance towards tightening monetary conditions, potentially signaling a future increase in interest rates."}, {"sentence": "The shift in the data s tarted with a bang  on February 1, with a big  increase i n the number of job openings in December that reversed the gradual easing over  several months in what is a key indicator of tightness in the labor market.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a \"big increase\" in job openings in December indicates a tightening labor market, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This shift in data may prompt the Federal Reserve to consider a more aggressive approach, such as raising interest rates, to maintain price stability."}, {"sentence": "Part of the FOMC\u2019s plan to lower inflation is r educing this  excess tightness , which has been driving elevated wage growth  and contributing to high inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is taking a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. They aim to reduce excess tightness, which has been causing elevated wage growth and high inflation, indicating a focus on tightening monetary measures to combat inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "T he Job O penings and L abor T urnover Survey data can be noisy so, at times, there is a tendency to downplay large moves .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC considers the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data to be potentially unreliable due to its noisiness. Therefore, they may downplay significant changes in the data, indicating a neutral stance towards its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "But then on February 3, the job report for January show ed a stunning 517,000 increase in employment  and the unemployment r ate moved down to a level not seen in over 50 years .2  These data indicated  that, instead of loosening, the labor market was tightening.3  A little over a week later, o n Valentine\u2019s Day , instead of a box of chocolates, we got the  1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the job report for January showed a significant increase in employment and a decrease in the unemployment rate, indicating a tightening labor market. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it may influence the FOMC's decision-making process, potentially leading to a more hawkish stance."}, {"sentence": "2 Some have argued that the large change in payroll employment should be discounted because of  unusually warm  weather; however, estimates of weather -adjusted employment a re also quite large.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the argument of discounting the large change in payroll employment due to warm weather is not valid, as weather-adjusted employment estimates are still significant. It is neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "See Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2023), \u201cWeather -Adjusted Employment Change,\u201d webpage, https://www.frbsf.org/economic -research/indicators -data/weather -adjusted -employment -change.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it refers to a webpage on weather-adjusted employment change, which does not directly impact the decision-making process of the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates or other monetary policy tools."}, {"sentence": "3 Of course, more people finding jobs is good.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance. It simply states that an increase in employment is positive, without addressing the committee's hawkish, dovish, or neutral position."}, {"sentence": "But in the context of ongoing labor market tightness, this above trend number can c omplicate efforts to move the economy toward  price stability, on which my remarks go into more detail.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite the above trend number, the ongoing labor market tightness could complicate efforts to achieve price stability. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it acknowledges the potential challenges but does not explicitly lean towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "- 2 -  consumer price i ndex ( CPI) inflation report for January and revisions to 2022.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering the consumer price index (CPI) inflation report for January and revisions to 2022. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the implications on US monetary policy. Therefore, the sentence is irrelevant in assessing whether the policy stance will be hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "By this measure,  not only had inflation stopped declining in January, it also slowed a lot less in the second half o f last year than previously reported.4  Later that week , data on producer prices  and last week \u2019s report on personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) prices reinforced these two points .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that inflation has stopped declining and slowed less than previously reported. The data on producer prices and PCE prices further supported these points. These observations are relevant to US monetary policy as they indicate a potential shift towards a more hawkish stance."}, {"sentence": "Retail sales for January also came in much stronger than expected , sugg esting t he economy was slowing less than it had appeared just a month earlier , a picture that was confirmed by data on personal spending, which represents almost 70 percent of gross domestic product.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The stronger-than-expected retail sales and the indication of a slower economic slowdown imply that the economy is performing better than previously thought. This may lead to a potential tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "Continuing progress on inflation depends on lowering demand and moderating economic activity, and the  retail sales and spending data suggest that progress on reducing aggregate demand may have stalled .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of lowering demand and moderating economic activity indicates a cautious approach to inflation. The statement that progress on reducing aggregate demand may have stalled implies a need for further measures to stimulate the economy, making it relevant to monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Whether or not subsequent data confirm the setback  in progress last month, the FOMC  will do what i s needed to reduce inflation to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective over time .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC is determined to take necessary actions to decrease inflation and achieve the Committee's 2 percent objective, regardless of whether future data confirms the setback in progress last month."}, {"sentence": "It is possible there may be some  bumps on that path, but I assure you, the FOMC\u2019s dual mandate objectives will be achieved .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. While acknowledging potential challenges (\"bumps\"), it reassures that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains committed to achieving its dual mandate objectives, indicating a balanced approach rather than leaning towards a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Inflation has been elevated for  nearly two years due to an excess of aggregate demand relative to supply.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of elevated inflation implies a need for action to curb it, indicating a potential tightening of monetary policy to reduce aggregate demand and bring it in line with supply."}, {"sentence": "Even though the fiscal stimulus and goods supply constraints that contributed to that imbalance have mostly unwound and the FOMC has rapidly raised the target range for the federal funds rate, the lab or market remains very tight and aggregate demand has proved resilient to considerable increases in interest rates.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite the unwinding of fiscal stimulus and goods supply constraints, the labor market remains tight and aggregate demand has remained strong even with considerable increases in interest rates. This implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it indicates that the FOMC's previous actions have not had a significant impact on the overall economic conditions."}, {"sentence": "One implication of the strong labor market is that the FOMC\u2019s maximum employment goal has been achieved and monetary policy can be utterly focused on fighting inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The strong labor market implies that the FOMC has achieved its maximum employment goal, allowing them to shift their focus towards fighting inflation."}, {"sentence": "Any fear that we might face  two-sided risk in achieving our dual mandate was blown away by the January employment numbers.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the January employment numbers have alleviated any concerns about the possibility of facing risks in achieving the dual mandate. As a result, it implies a more positive outlook on the economy, which could be seen as hawkish or neutral for US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "But  4 Each year , with the release of the January CPI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recalculates seasonal adjustment factors.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the annual recalculation of seasonal adjustment factors by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which does not directly impact the hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance of the policy."}, {"sentence": "This adjustment result ed in noticeable  revisions to 2022 seasonally adjusted CPI prices .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only discusses adjustments and revisions to CPI prices in 2022. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance, thus having no implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "- 3 -  an excessively tight labor market complicates the path toward achieving price stability , because wages are growing faster than they have in decades, at a pace that may contribut e to keeping inflation elevated.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of an excessively tight labor market and wages growing faster than in decades implies concerns about inflationary pressures. This could lead to a more aggressive approach in tightening monetary policy to maintain price stability."}, {"sentence": "We see this excess pressure in the fast growth of services prices, where labor costs are a higher share of overall input costs and shortages of workers are reportedly most acute.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of excess pressure in services prices, higher labor costs, and shortages of workers indicates potential inflationary pressures. This could imply a need for tighter monetary policy to curb inflation, making it relevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Although inflation  has been coming down since the middle of last year, the recent data indicate that we h aven\u2019t made as much progress as we thought .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Despite the decrease in inflation, the recent data indicates that the progress made is not as significant as anticipated. This implies a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy, indicating a neutral or even slightly dovish outlook."}, {"sentence": "That assessment goes for both overall inflation, and \u201ccore\u201d inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices and is a good guide to future price increases .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the assessment of both overall inflation and \"core\" inflation is important for future price increases. It is neutral as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "And this holds for both CPI and PCE measures of inflation .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the statement applies to both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) measures of inflation. However, it does not provide any indication of whether the statement is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Core CPI inflation over  the last three months of 2022 was revised up from 3.1 percent ( at an annual rate) to now be 4.3 percent .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish implication on US monetary policy. The upward revision of Core CPI inflation suggests a higher inflation rate, which may prompt the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to adopt a more cautious or tightening stance to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Similarly , the 2022 fourth quarter  PCE inflation data was revised from 2.9 percent to 3.6 percent.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about the revision of the 2022 fourth quarter PCE inflation data. It does not indicate any stance or implications on monetary policy, making it unrelated to being hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "And  the three- month rate s increased  in January ; even measures that trim out the largest and smallest price changes saw increases .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that interest rates have increased in January, even when considering measures that exclude extreme price changes. This indicates a hawkish stance, implying a potential tightening of US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "These data underscore the view , as laid out in the FOMC\u2019s  December Summary of Economic Projections, that the fight to bring inflation down to our 2 percent  target will be slower and longer than many had expected just a month or two ago.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the FOMC acknowledges the slower and longer fight to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target, indicating a more patient and accommodative approach towards monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I don\u2019t want to brush aside the fact that we have made progress in reducing inflation , and there are indications that  further improvement  is coming.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges progress in reducing inflation and hints at the possibility of further improvement, indicating a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "T he three -month inflation  rate is running below the  12-month rate, which highlights the progress.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of inflation running below the 12-month rate indicates a potential concern about low inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy to stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "And there are reasons to be optimistic about continued improvement, including a sha rp deceleration in rent increases  since the middle of last year , which will start to get captured in inflation statistics only in the coming months.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a sharp deceleration in rent increases implies a potential decrease in inflation, which may lead to a more accommodative approach by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."}, {"sentence": "- 4 -  But recent data suggest that consumer spending isn\u2019t slowing that much, that the labor market continues  to run unsustainably hot, and that inflation is not coming down as fast as I had thought .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of consumer spending not slowing much, a labor market running unsustainably hot, and inflation not decreasing as expected indicates a need for tighter monetary policy to control potential overheating and inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "It could be that progress has stalled, or i t is possible that the numbers released last month were a blip , perhaps associated with unusually favorable weather, and that forthcoming data will show that economic activity and inflation resumed their decline.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the possibility of progress stalling or the previous numbers being a blip, but also anticipates forthcoming data showing a decline in economic activity and inflation. Therefore, it does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance and is irrelevant to immediate policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "Fortunately, we will get the next employment report and CPI release ahead of the March 21\u201322 FOMC meeting , information that will affect my assessment of the appropriate next step for monetary policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the upcoming employment report and CPI release will have an impact on the speaker's evaluation of the suitable next move for monetary policy. It implies a neutral stance as it acknowledges the relevance of the information without indicating a specific bias towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "If job creation drops back down to a level  consistent with the downward trajectory seen late last year and CPI inflation pulls back significant ly from the Janua ry numbers and resumes  its downward path, then I would endorse  raising the target range for the federal funds rate a couple more times , to a  projected terminal rate between 5.1 and 5.4 percent .5  On the other hand, if those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were release d.  I would be ver y pleased if the data we receive on inflation and the labor market this month  show signs of moderation, which would suggest that the February data releases were just a bump in the road and that progress is continuing.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that if job creation slows down and inflation decreases, the speaker would support raising the federal funds rate. This indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. However, if the data reports continue to show strong numbers, the policy target range may need to be raised even more. The speaker expresses a desire for data on inflation and the labor market to show signs of moderation, indicating a dovish sentiment."}, {"sentence": "But wishful thinking is not a substit ute for hard evidence, in the form of economic data.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of relying on concrete economic data rather than wishful thinking, indicating a cautious approach that is neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "After seeing promising signs of progress, we cannot risk a revival of inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC is concerned about the potential revival of inflation and emphasizes the need to avoid it, indicating a preference for tighter monetary measures to maintain price stability."}, {"sentence": "5 This estimate of the terminal rate would align with the central tendency of FOMC participants\u2019 projections  of the federal funds rate at the end of 2023.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the estimate of the terminal rate is in line with the average projection of FOMC participants for the federal funds rate in 2023. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it indicates a balance between hawkish and dovish views."}]
