The speaker believes that progress on inflation will be slow due to the current level of policy restraint, indicating a need for further tightening to effectively reduce inflation in a sustainable and timely manner."}, {"sentence": "It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a pre -set course.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.
