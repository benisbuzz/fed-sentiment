The speaker acknowledges the intention to implement tighter monetary policy to curb demand and reduce inflationary pressures, indicating a more aggressive approach towards managing the economy."}, {"sentence": "One way is by influencing the labor market, so next I will give an update about labor market conditions and how I expect them to evolve .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker intends to provide an update on labor market conditions and their expected evolution, indicating a focus on economic factors. While it does not explicitly state a stance on monetary policy, it implies a neutral tone as it does not lean towards hawkish or dovish views."}, {"sentence": "I\u2019ll then  turn to the outlook for inflation, where we saw moderation  in some measures in October , but to a level that remains unacceptably high.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of moderation in inflation measures implies a cautious approach, while the statement that the level remains unacceptably high indicates a willingness to take action to address it."}, {"sentence": "I\u2019ll finish up with how I expect monetary policy will evolve in the coming months to reduc e inflation and r eturn it to the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) 2 percent goal.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates an intention to reduce inflation and return it to the FOMC's 2 percent goal. This implies a potential tightening of monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Economic growth in the United States has slowed significantly in 2022,  and I expect that slow growth to continue into next year.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The acknowledgment of slowed economic growth and the expectation of its continuation indicate a cautious approach, implying a potential need for accommodative measures to support the economy."}, {"sentence": "After shrinking  slightly in the first half of this  year, real gross domestic product rebounded in the third quarter to a 2.6 percent annual growth rate.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a positive economic growth in the US, suggesting a potential shift towards a more hawkish stance in US monetary policy. The rebound in real gross domestic product implies a stronger economy, which may lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "But all indications are that this was a temporary boost,  and that weak growth has returned in the last quarter of this year  and will persist into 2023 .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The indication of weak growth persisting into 2023 implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may adopt accommodative measures to support the economy, rather than taking a hawkish approach by tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Consumer and business spending has softened, amid deteriorating business sentiment in most sectors of the economy and near -record -low readings on surveys of consumer attitudes about the economy.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The softening of consumer and business spending, along with deteriorating business sentiment, indicates a weakening economy. Additionally, near-record-low readings on consumer attitudes imply a lack of confidence, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more accommodative or neutral approach."}, {"sentence": "There is no secret about why\u2014inflation is very high, something people are reminded of every day when they see the prices of things they buy go up.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

It indicates a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "On top of that, higher interest rates are raising borrowing costs for businesses and households.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that higher interest rates are impacting borrowing costs for businesses and households. It implies a hawkish stance as it highlights the tightening of monetary policy, which aims to control inflation but may potentially slow down economic growth."}, {"sentence": "- 2 - At any other time, I would be pretty unhappy  about slowing growth, but not now .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges their usual concern about slowing growth, but indicates that it is currently irrelevant or not a priority due to the prevailing circumstances."}, {"sentence": "If you believe, as I do, that supply bottlenecks in the economy have mostly abated and that elevated inflation is primarily a function of high demand, then slowing down economic growth  is absolutely necessary to bring inflation  down to our 2 percent target .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the speaker believes supply bottlenecks have diminished and high inflation is driven by strong demand. Therefore, they argue for slowing down economic growth to achieve the 2 percent inflation target."}, {"sentence": "This slowing in activity is a sign that action s taken by the Federal Reserve this year to reduce inflation are working.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the Federal Reserve's actions to reduce inflation are effective, as evidenced by the slowing in activity. This implies that the Fed may maintain or even ease its current monetary policy stance."}, {"sentence": "The Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy to reduc e inflation primarily by raising short -term interest rates , which  has the effect of boosting  interest rates throughout the economy.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the Federal Reserve adopts a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. By tightening monetary policy and raising short-term interest rates, they aim to reduce inflation. This action has the effect of increasing interest rates across the economy."}, {"sentence": "Higher  borrowing costs curtail spending and investment by households and businesses.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that higher borrowing costs have a negative impact on spending and investment by households and businesses. It implies a potentially hawkish stance on US monetary policy, as it highlights the potential need for tighter monetary measures to control inflation and prevent excessive borrowing."}, {"sentence": "Since the FOMC pivoted in late 2021 in response to upwardly revised labor data and higher than anticipated inflation data , rates for  30-year fixed -rate home mortgages are up from around 3 percent  to 7 percent today.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC's pivot in response to labor data and inflation indicates a tightening approach. The significant increase in rates for 30-year fixed-rate home mortgages further supports this hawkish stance."}, {"sentence": "Rates for triple -B corporate bonds have roughly doubled in 202 2, and rates on higher yield debt ha ve increased even more.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The significant increase in rates for triple-B corporate bonds and higher yield debt indicates tightening financial conditions, which may prompt the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to consider a more cautious approach in terms of monetary stimulus."}, {"sentence": "As a result, there is a slowdown in the volume of financing in most markets, with some effect on various prices.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a slowdown in financing and its impact on prices. Although it does not explicitly mention monetary policy, it implies a potential economic slowdown.

However, it does not provide any direct implications on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in terms of its impact on monetary policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "- 3 -  Furthermore, housing  price s that were increasing at an annual rate of 20 percent as late as May slowed to about a 2  percent rate in October , according to data from Zillow .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that there has been a significant slowdown in housing price growth from 20 percent in May to about 2 percent in October, based on data from Zillow. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it indicates a potential shift towards a more neutral stance, as the rapid increase in housing prices has slowed down."}, {"sentence": "Housing may be  the first but won\u2019t be the last sector of the economy where higher interest rates will have the effect of dampening demand and will ultimately help moderate price increases.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that higher interest rates will be implemented to dampen demand in the housing sector, which will help moderate price increases. This indicates a tightening approach to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Our goal is to rein in demand, bringing demand and supply into better balance, which will help reduce upward  pressure on inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

Despite the slowed economic output, the emphasis on the labor market being very tight indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee may prioritize maintaining accommodative measures to support employment and stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "While there was roughly one job vacancy for every job seeker in what was a strong labor market before the pandemic, now there are almost two jobs for every person looking  for work .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a significant shift in the labor market, indicating a more favorable condition for job seekers. With almost two jobs available for every person looking for work, it implies a dovish implication on US monetary policy as it may reduce the urgency for aggressive measures to stimulate employment."}, {"sentence": "Wages have been rising more quickly than they have in decades, much faster than productivity growth plus 2 percentage points that I think of as consistent with the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent inflation objective.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of wages rising quickly implies potential inflationary pressures, which may prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to maintain their 2 percent inflation objective."}, {"sentence": "But I  do see t entative signs of some cooling in the labor market, which is vital to keep rising labor costs from put ting upward pressure on inflation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of cooling in the labor market indicates a potential slowdown, which could help prevent rising labor costs from fueling inflation."}, {"sentence": "The employment report published November  4 showed that payrolls grew by 261,000 in October.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence indicates a positive development in the US labor market, suggesting a potential improvement in the economy. However, without further context or information, it is irrelevant to determine its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "This increase, while large,  was a step down from the pace earlier this year , when payrolls grew an average of 539,000 per month in the first quarter, 340,000 per month in the second quarter and 381,000 per  month in the third quarter.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates a decrease in the pace of payroll growth compared to earlier this year, but does not provide any indication of whether this change is viewed as hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant by the FOMC."}, {"sentence": "At the same time, w e also saw  the unemployment rate tick up to 3.7 percent , though still close to its  more  than 50-year low.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of the unemployment rate ticking up slightly indicates a potential slowdown in the economy, but the fact that it remains close to its more than 50-year low implies a relatively strong labor market. Overall, this information does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, making it irrelevant for immediate monetary policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "Other labor market data are also showing evidence of slight cooling.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a slightly cooling labor market, which could be interpreted as a dovish signal for US monetary policy. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the overall implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Various surveys of job vacancies  are down from the ir peak s reached in March but are still historically very high.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that although job vacancies have decreased from their peak in March, they remain historically high. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it indicates a strong labor market.

It does not provide any indication of whether the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would adopt a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "These tentative signs of cooling are mixed with many stories of continued labor market tightness.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.

It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "And that is even with some expectation of slower sales growth in the next couple quarters.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite the anticipation of slower sales growth in the near future, it does not have a significant impact on US monetary policy. Therefore, it can be considered irrelevant in terms of its implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "That said , we are starting to see some tentative signs of a moderati on in wage growth.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.

However, the decrease is not significant enough to be considered a major shift, so it can be considered relatively neutral."}, {"sentence": "Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, increased 0.3 percent in October  from September , a marked step -down from the 0.6 percent readings in the previous two months  and the average of 0.5 percent over the first  - 5 - nine months of 2022.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The decrease in Core CPI from the previous two months and the average over the first nine months of 2022 indicates a slowdown in inflationary pressures, which may lead to a more accommodative stance by the Federal Reserve."}, {"sentence": "On a twelve -month change, core inflation came in at about 6.3 percent, down from 6.6 percent  the previous month.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence indicates a decrease in core inflation, suggesting a dovish stance on US monetary policy.
