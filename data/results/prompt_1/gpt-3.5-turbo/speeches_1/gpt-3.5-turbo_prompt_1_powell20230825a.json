The speaker emphasizes the Fed's commitment to bringing inflation down to the 2 percent goal, indicating a willingness to take necessary actions to tighten monetary policy if needed."}, {"sentence": "We have tightened policy significantly over the past year .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has implemented measures to restrict the availability of money in the economy, potentially to control inflation or stabilize the economy."}, {"sentence": "Although inflation has moved down from its peak \u2014a welcome development \u2014it remains too high.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The acknowledgment of inflation moving down from its peak is seen as a positive development, but the concern that it still remains too high indicates a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our obj ective.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The statement indicates a willingness to raise rates further and maintain a restrictive policy until inflation moves sustainably down. This implies a cautious approach to ensure inflation aligns with the objective, indicating a focus on controlling inflation rather than stimulating economic growth."}, {"sentence": "Today I will review our progress so far and discuss the outlook and the uncertainties we face as we pursue  our dual mandate goals.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker will assess the current situation and future prospects, considering the uncertainties, in relation to the dual mandate goals of the FOMC. It is neutral as it does not provide any specific indication of a hawkish or dovish stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I will conclude with a summary of what this means for policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker will provide a summary of the implications of the discussed matter on policy. While it does not explicitly indicate whether the summary will be hawkish, dovish, or neutral, it implies that it will be relevant to US monetary policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "Given how far we have come, at upcoming meetings we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The use of \"proceed carefully\" indicates a cautious approach, which aligns with a neutral stance. The mention of assessing incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks implies a data-dependent approach rather than a predetermined hawkish or dovish bias."}, {"sentence": "The Decline in Inflation So Far The ongoing episode of high inflation initially emerged  from a collision between very strong demand  and pandemic -constrained supply.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the high inflation experienced in the US was a result of a combination of strong demand and supply constraints caused by the pandemic. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it does not explicitly indicate a shift towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "By the time the Federal Open Market Committee raised the policy rate in March 2022, i t was clear that bringing down inflation would depend on both the unwinding of  the unprecede nted pandemic -related demand and supply distortions  and on our tightening of monetary policy , which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing  supply time to catch up.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of raising the policy rate and tightening of monetary policy indicates a willingness to combat inflation by reducing aggregate demand. The focus on unwinding pandemic-related distortions implies a proactive approach to address supply and demand imbalances."}, {"sentence": "While these two forces are now working together to bring down inflation, the p rocess still has a long way to go, even with the more favorable recent readings.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite the collaboration of these forces to reduce inflation, the process is far from complete, even with recent positive indicators. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it acknowledges the ongoing efforts without indicating a clear inclination towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "On a 12 -month basis, U.S. total, or \u201cheadline,\u201d PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation peaked at 7 percent in June 2022 and declined to 3.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence indicates that U.S. headline PCE inflation peaked at 7 percent in June 2022 and subsequently declined to 3 percent on a 12-month basis.

The focus on the positive impact for households and businesses implies a supportive approach towards maintaining accommodative measures."}, {"sentence": "But food and energy prices are influenced by global factors that remain volatile, and can provide a misleading signal  of where inflation is headed .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that food and energy prices, which are influenced by global factors, may not accurately indicate the direction of inflation. Therefore, it implies that these factors are irrelevant in determining US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In my remaining comments,  I will focus on core PCE inflation, which omits the food and energy components.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The speaker plans to discuss core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, suggesting a balanced approach to assessing inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "On a 12 -month basis, core PCE inflation peaked at 5.4 percent in February 2022 and declined gradually to 4.3 percent in July  (figure 1, panel B) .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates that core PCE inflation in the US reached its highest point at 5.4 percent in February 2022 and then gradually decreased to 4.3 percent in July.

However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the implications on US monetary policy. Therefore, the sentence is irrelevant in assessing the monetary policy stance as hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "As the pandemic and its effects have waned, production  and inventories  have grown, and supply has improved .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the pandemic's impact on the economy has diminished, leading to increased production, inventories, and improved supply. These positive developments may indicate a more hawkish stance on US monetary policy as the economy recovers."}, {"sentence": "At the same time, higher interest rates have weigh ed on demand .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that higher interest rates have negatively impacted demand. This implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy, as it indicates a concern for the potential negative effects of tightening monetary conditions on economic activity."}, {"sentence": "Interest rates on auto loans have nearly doubled  since early last year , and customers report feeling the effect of higher rates on affordability.2  On net, motor vehicle inflation has declined sharply because of the combined effects of these supply and demand factors.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The increase in interest rates on auto loans has negatively impacted affordability for customers, leading to a decline in motor vehicle inflation. This indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee may consider a more accommodative approach to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "Similar dynamics are playing out for core goods inflation overall.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the dynamics of core goods inflation are similar to other factors affecting US monetary policy. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this information is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant to the policy stance."}, {"sentence": "As they do, the effects of monetary restraint should show through more fu lly over time.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the effects of monetary restraint will become more apparent over time.

Despite the recent decline in core goods prices, the fact that core goods inflation remains significantly higher than its pre-pandemic level indicates potential concerns about rising inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Sustained progress is needed, and restrictive monetary policy is called for to achieve that progress.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes sustained progress requires a restrictive monetary policy, implying a willingness to tighten monetary conditions to achieve their goals."}, {"sentence": "In the highly interest -sensitive housing sector, the effects of monetary policy became apparent soon after liftoff.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the effects of monetary policy on the interest-sensitive housing sector were noticeable shortly after the liftoff. It implies a hawkish stance as it indicates that the policy actions had an impact on the sector, highlighting the importance of monitoring and potentially adjusting the policy to maintain stability."}, {"sentence": "Mortgage rates doubled over the course of 2022, causing housing starts and sales to fall and house price growth to plummet.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests a negative impact on the housing market due to the doubling of mortgage rates in 2022.

Some of it likely reflects higher interest rates and the softening in real household income grow th over the past couple of years .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the slowing in rent growth is likely influenced by higher interest rates and the softening in real household income growth. These factors could be seen as dovish for US monetary policy, as they indicate potential economic challenges and may warrant a more accommodative stance."}, {"sentence": "But    - 4 - Measured housing services inflation lagged these changes , as is typical, but has recently begun to fall.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the measured housing services inflation has been slow to respond to changes, which is typical.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will closely monitor market rent data to assess the potential risks to housing services inflation, without indicating a clear inclination towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "The final category, nonhousing services, accounts for over half of the core PCE index and includes a broad range of services, such as health care, food services, transportation, and accommodations.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it provides information about the components of the core PCE index, which does not directly impact the decision-making process of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding interest rates."}, {"sentence": "Twelve -month inflation  in this sector has moved sideways since liftoff.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the inflation in this sector has remained relatively stable since the liftoff, indicating a neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Inflation measured over the past three and six months has declined, however, which is encouraging.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of declining inflation is encouraging, indicating a potential need for accommodative measures to stimulate the economy."}, {"sentence": "Part of the reason for the modest decline of nonhousing services inflation so far is that many of these services were less affected b y  the normalization of dislocations due to the pandemic is likely playing a role here as well.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the normalization of dislocations due to the pandemic has contributed to the modest decline in nonhousing services inflation. However, it does not provide a clear indication of whether this has a hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant implication on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "For example, the shifts in housing preferences  related to working from home  likely contributed to the increase in housing demand reflected in the sizable earlier increases in rents.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the shifts in housing preferences due to remote work have likely played a role in the significant rise in housing demand and rents.

However, without further context or information, it is difficult to determine whether this development is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "While nominal wage growth   - 7 - must ultimately slow to a rate that is consistent with 2 percent inflation, what matters for households is real wage growth.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence is neutral as it discusses the importance of real wage growth for households rather than indicating a specific stance on US monetary policy. It does not provide any indication of whether the policy will be hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Even as nominal wage growth has slowed, real wage growth has been increa sing as inflation has fallen.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. Despite the slowdown in nominal wage growth, the increase in real wage growth due to falling inflation indicates a positive impact on consumers' purchasing power, which may support a more accommodative stance by the Federal Reserve."}, {"sentence": "We expect this labor market rebalancing to continue.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the labor market rebalancing is expected to persist. As it does not provide any indication of the stance on interest rates or inflation, it is irrelevant to US monetary policy and its implications."}, {"sentence": "Evidence  that the tightness  in the labor market  is no longer easing could also call for a monetary  policy response .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that if the tightness in the labor market continues to persist, it may require a monetary policy response. This implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it acknowledges the need for potential adjustments without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Uncertainty and Risk Management along the Path Forward  Two percent is and will remain our inflation target.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. It simply states that the inflation target will remain at two percent, without addressing uncertainty and risk management."}, {"sentence": "W e are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to that level  over time .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the commitment to achieving a restrictive stance to bring down inflation. The focus on inflation indicates a willingness to prioritize price stability over other objectives, indicating a less accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "There are some challenges that are common to all tightening cycles.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the challenges faced during tightening cycles are common. It is neutral as it does not explicitly indicate a specific stance on US monetary policy. However, it implies that these challenges should be considered when formulating policy decisions, which could have implications on the overall approach taken by the FOMC."}, {"sentence": "For example, real interest rates are now positive and well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy ra te.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The fact that real interest rates are currently positive and significantly higher than the estimated neutral policy rate indicates a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "We see the current stance of policy as restrictive, putting  downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The use of the term \"restrictive\" implies a tightening of policy, which aims to slow down economic activity, hiring, and inflation."}, {"sentence": "But we cannot identify with certainty the neutral rate of interest, and thus there is always uncertainty about the precise level of monetary policy restraint .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC acknowledges the difficulty in determining the neutral rate of interest, leading to uncertainty regarding the appropriate level of monetary policy restraint. It implies a neutral stance as the FOMC recognizes the limitations in identifying the neutral rate, making it irrelevant to determine a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "That assessment is further com plicated by uncertainty about the duration of the lags with which monetary tightening affects economic activity and especially inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the uncertainty surrounding the time it takes for monetary tightening to impact the economy and inflation makes it difficult to assess the current state of US monetary policy. Therefore, it is irrelevant to determine whether the sentence has hawkish, dovish, or neutral implications."}, {"sentence": "Since the symposium a year ago, the Committee has raised the policy rate by 300 basis points , including 100 basis poi nts over the past seven months .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The Committee's decision to raise the policy rate by 300 basis points, including 100 basis points in the past seven months, suggests a tightening approach to control inflation and potentially slow down economic growth."}, {"sentence": "And we have  substantially reduced the size of our securities holdings .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The phrase \"substantially reduced the size of our securities holdings\" indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a hawkish approach focused on reducing stimulus and potentially raising interest rates."}, {"sentence": "Beyond these traditional sources of po licy uncertainty , the supply and demand dislocations unique to this cycle raise further complications through their effects on   - 8 - inflation and labor market dynamics.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the unique supply and demand dislocations in the current cycle complicate inflation and labor market dynamics, which could have implications on US monetary policy. However, it does not provide a clear indication of whether the implications are hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "For example, so far, j ob openings have declined substantially without increasing  unemployme nt\u2014a highly welcome but historically unusual result that appears to reflect large excess demand for labor.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The decline in job openings without increasing unemployment indicates a highly welcome result, implying a strong demand for labor. This may prompt policymakers to maintain or even expand accommodative measures to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "In addition, there is evidence that inflation has become  more responsive to labor market tightness than was the case in  recent  decades .8  These cha nging dynamics may or may not persist, and this uncertainty underscores the need for agile policymaking.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that inflation has become more sensitive to labor market conditions, indicating a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The changing dynamics and uncertainty emphasize the importance of flexible policymaking."}, {"sentence": "These uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening  monetary policy  too much against  the risk of tightenin g too little.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the uncertainties, both old and new, make it challenging for the FOMC to find the right balance between tightening monetary policy too much (hawkish) and tightening too little (dovish). It implies that the FOMC is cautious and aware of the potential risks, indicating a neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Doing too little could allow above -target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to employment.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of not doing too little to address above-target inflation, as it could lead to persistent inflation and negatively impact employment."}, {"sentence": "Doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that being overly aggressive in implementing measures could potentially cause unnecessary damage to the economy, indicating a cautious approach towards policy actions."}, {"sentence": "In such circumstances, risk -management considerations are critical.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that risk management is crucial in certain circumstances. Although it does not explicitly mention monetary policy, it implies a cautious approach, which can be seen as a dovish stance, prioritizing stability and potentially influencing US monetary policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "At upcoming meeting s, we will assess our progress based on the totality of the data and the evolving outlook and risks.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The use of \"assess our progress\" and \"totality of the data\" indicates a cautious approach, neither hawkish nor dovish. The focus on the evolving outlook and risks implies a willingness to adapt policy as needed."}, {"sentence": "Based on this assessment, we will proceed carefully as we decide whether to tighten further or, instead, to hold the policy rate constant and await further  data.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The use of \"proceed carefully\" indicates a cautious approach, while the mention of deciding whether to tighten further or hold the policy rate constant shows a balanced consideration. The reference to awaiting further data implies a data-dependent approach, which aligns with a neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "8 The relationship between labor market slack and inflation, often called  the Phillips curve relationship, is likely nonlinear, steepening in a tight labor market.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the relationship between labor market slack and inflation, known as the Phillips curve, becomes steeper in a tight labor market. This implies a hawkish stance on US monetary policy, as it indicates that as the labor market tightens, inflationary pressures may increase."}, {"sentence": "If the Phillips curve has steepened in this way, a small change in labor market tightness could result in a more substantial change in inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that if the Phillips curve has steepened, indicating a stronger relationship between labor market tightness and inflation, a slight change in labor market conditions could lead to a significant impact on inflation. This implies a potentially hawkish stance on US monetary policy, as policymakers may need to closely monitor and respond to even small changes in the labor market to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "It is difficult to know with precision how steep that relationship is in real time  or how it might evolve as labor market tightness changes.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the uncertainty in determining the exact relationship between labor market tightness and its impact on the economy, indicating a cautious approach. Therefore, it is irrelevant to categorize it as hawkish or dovish."}, {"sentence": "For more information on nonlinearities in this relationship, see Christoph E.
