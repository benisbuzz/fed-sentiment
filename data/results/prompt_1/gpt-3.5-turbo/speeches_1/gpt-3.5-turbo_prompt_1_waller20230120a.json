It highlights that a year ago, inflation was high and increasing rapidly, leading the Fed to swiftly and significantly tighten monetary policy. This indicates a proactive approach to combat inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "A t the end of December , the federal funds rate target was set in a range of 4 .25 percent to 4.5 percent, the highest in 15 years.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of the federal funds rate target being set at the highest level in 15 years suggests a tightening of monetary policy, reflecting a more aggressive approach to control inflation and potentially slow down economic growth."}, {"sentence": "Economic activity, meanwhile, has been holding up well.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current state of economic activity in the US is positive and stable. However, without further context, it is irrelevant to determine its implications on US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "After shrinking slightly in the first half of 2022, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the third quarter, and monthly data suggest it grew around 2 percent in the fourth quarter.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the US economy experienced a rebound in the third quarter of 2022, with a growth rate of 3.2 percent. However, the growth rate slowed down in the fourth quarter, estimated to be around 2 percent. This information is relevant for assessing the current state of the economy but is neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I expect such  slowing to continue in this quarter, which is both expected and desirable in our ongoing fight to lower inflation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The expectation of slowing economic growth in the current quarter is seen as desirable in the ongoing fight to lower inflation, indicating a preference for accommodative measures rather than tightening."}, {"sentence": "The FOMC\u2019s  goal in raising interest rates is to  dampen demand and economic activity  to support further reduc tions in inflation .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC aims to raise interest rates to decrease demand and economic activity, with the intention of achieving lower inflation rates."}, {"sentence": "And t here is ample evidence that this is exactly what is going on in the business sector.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that there is sufficient evidence indicating the described situation is occurring in the business sector.

The widespread slowdown in services activity, particularly in construction and real estate, indicates the negative impact of higher interest rates. This could potentially lead to a more cautious approach by the Federal Reserve in terms of raising rates further."}, {"sentence": "This slowing in business activity i s consistent with t he FOMC\u2019s goal of damp ing demand and reducing production so that it is in  better alignment with the productive capacity of the economy.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy.

The speaker emphasizes that the goal is not to halt economic activity, indicating a non-hawkish approach. They also mention closely monitoring certain sectors, implying a cautious and potentially dovish stance to ensure the moderation of economic activity continues smoothly."}, {"sentence": "Growth in consumer spending has also begun to slow.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth, is slowing down. This could have implications on US monetary policy as it may influence the Federal Reserve's decision to adopt a more dovish stance to stimulate economic activity and support growth."}, {"sentence": "While that growth was surprisingly strong through most of the second half of 2022, nom inal personal consumption expenditures growth slowed to 0.1 percent in November, and retail sales fell 1 percent.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a potential shift towards a more dovish stance in US monetary policy. The slowdown in nominal personal consumption expenditures growth and the decline in retail sales indicate a weakening in consumer spending, which may prompt policymakers to adopt a more accommodative approach to stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "We don\u2019t have spending data on goods and services for December, but retail sales fell another 1.1 percent.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy.

The mention of last year's decline in real incomes and higher borrowing costs implies a cautious approach towards consumer spending. The expectation of moderating consumer spending and prompt return of inflation to the target indicates a preference for maintaining accommodative measures."}, {"sentence": "Job one is maintaining  the progress we are making in lowering inflation, and moderation in consumer spending will support that progress.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Employment  - 3 - grew robustly in the leisure and health -care sectors, where labor shortages are reportedly  severe.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The robust growth in employment, particularly in sectors facing severe labor shortages, indicates a strong economy. This may imply a need for tighter monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "While the labor market is strong, it is also tight.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the labor market in the US is both strong and tight. It implies a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates a potential need for tighter monetary measures to prevent inflationary pressures resulting from a strong and tight labor market."}, {"sentence": "The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in December , matching the low reached before the pandemic, and the lowest in 53 years.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence indicates a positive development in the US labor market, with the unemployment rate reaching pre-pandemic levels and a historic low in 53 years. However, without further context, it is irrelevant to determine its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "But there are signs that demand for labor is moderating.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a potential shift towards a more neutral stance in US monetary policy. The mention of moderating labor demand indicates a possible slowdown in economic growth, which could prompt a less hawkish approach by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."}, {"sentence": "J ob openings reported in the November Job Openings and Labor Tur nover Survey and job postings from December \u2019s Indeed data are down from their recent peak s.

The decrease in job openings and temporary-help employment may indicate a potential shift towards hiring full-time workers, which could help maintain job stability. However, it does not provide a clear indication of whether the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will adopt a hawkish, dovish, or neutral approach in response to this trend."}, {"sentence": "A robust labor market, despite modest economic growth, is a plus for workers and allows the Fed  to focus on lower ing inflation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Despite modest economic growth, the robust labor market is seen as positive for workers. It also implies that the Fed can prioritize addressing lower inflation, indicating a cautious and accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "It shows that jobs  and income can hold up to the effects of higher interest rates , help ing the FOMC  continue its efforts to lower inflation to our 2 percent goal by further tightening monetary policy.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the FOMC believes that jobs and income can withstand the impact of higher interest rates, allowing them to pursue further tightening of monetary policy to lower inflation towards their 2 percent target."}, {"sentence": "A potential downside of a tight labor market is if labor costs , which heavily influence inflation, grow so fast t hat they  slow progress toward the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the concern that if labor costs grow too quickly due to a tight labor market, it could hinder progress towards the FOMC's 2 percent inflation objective. This implies a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy to avoid potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Wages and other measures of compensation accelerated as inflation surged in the second half of 2021 and wage growth remained high in 2022.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The acceleration of wages and compensation, along with high wage growth, indicates potential inflationary pressures. This could imply a need for the Federal Reserve to adopt a more restrictive monetary policy to curb inflation."}, {"sentence": "But a s overall inflation has begun to moderate in recent months, so ha ve some measures of growth in wages and other compensation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of inflation moderating and growth in wages and compensation slowing down indicates a less aggressive approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "For example, t he 12- month increase in average hourly earnings hit a recent peak of 5.6 percent in March ( which is when the Fed began raising interest rates) and has been falling gradually and fairly steadily since then, reaching an annual ra te of 4.6 percent in December.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the recent decrease in the 12-month increase in average hourly earnings indicates a slowing trend, which could be seen as dovish for US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The 3- month annualized change in average hourly earnings \u2014 - 4 - 4.1 percent  in December \u2014is running below the 12- month rate and is thus a signal of ongoing moderation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of the 3-month annualized change in average hourly earnings running below the 12-month rate indicates ongoing moderation, implying a cautious approach towards interest rate hikes to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "These are encouraging signs, but we need to see continued impro vement across various measures of labor costs, because additional moderation is needed to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal and because a significant  escalation in wage growth could drive up longer -range i nflation expectations .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The focus on the need for continued improvement in labor costs and the mention of moderation in inflation indicate a cautious approach. The concern about a significant escalation in wage growth driving up inflation expectations further supports the dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Those longer -range expectations  have been fairly s table through this period of very high inflation, and we want it to stay that way because escalating expectations could drive inflation higher.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC aims to maintain stable longer-range expectations to prevent escalating inflation. The focus on preventing inflationary expectations implies a cautious approach, indicating a hawkish stance."}, {"sentence": "Let me turn now to the outlook for inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the speaker is shifting the focus to discussing the future expectations of inflation. As it does not provide any specific stance or indication on the direction of monetary policy, it can be considered irrelevant to determining whether the US monetary policy is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Last week\u2019s report on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that inflation continued to moderate in December, which was very welcome news.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of inflation moderating in December is seen as welcome news, indicating a preference for a more accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "First, I am going to spell out why this was such good news, and then I am goi ng to turn around and explain why I am still cautious about  the inflation outlook and supportive of continued monetary policy tightening.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the positive aspects but remains cautious about the inflation outlook, indicating a balanced approach. The mention of \"continued monetary policy tightening\" implies a hawkish sentiment towards future actions."}, {"sentence": "Overall headline inflation fell a tenth of a percent month over month in December, the first monthly drop since May 2020.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The decrease in overall headline inflation indicates a potential slowdown in economic growth, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to maintain or adopt accommodative measures to stimulate the economy."}, {"sentence": "The 12- month change  in inflation peak ed at 9 percent i n June, and  has fallen every month since, t o 6.5 percent in December.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The decreasing trend in inflation from 9 percent to 6.5 percent indicates a decline in price levels, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more accommodative stance to stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "A big factor in  the monthly decline in headline inflation in December  was a significant drop in energy prices, which more than offset a n increase in food price s.  The FOMC targets head line inflation because food and energy are considerable expenses for most people, but they are more volatile than other components of the index, and by factoring them out, \u201ccore\u201d inflation c an provide a picture of where inflation is headed .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the significant drop in energy prices outweighed the increase in food prices, leading to a decline in headline inflation in December. The FOMC targets headline inflation as it considers food and energy expenses, but acknowledges their volatility. Therefore, this sentence is relevant to US monetary policy as it provides insight into the factors influencing inflation, but it does not indicate a specific stance of being hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Y early core inflation was down in December to 5.7 percent, from 6 percent in November and a peak of 6.6 percent in September.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The decrease in yearly core inflation indicates a decline in price levels, which may alleviate concerns about inflationary pressures. This could potentially support a more accommodative stance from the Federal Reserve."}, {"sentence": "Over   - 5 - the past three months, core CPI inflation has run at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent , a noticeable drop from earlier in 2022.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The noticeable drop in core CPI inflation over the past three months indicates a decrease in price levels, which may prompt the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to adopt a more accommodative stance to stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "Another encouraging sign is that higher inflation was less concentrated\u2014the share of categories of different goods and services with  inflation over 3 percent has declined in the past several months, from almost three fourths  in early 2022 to less than one half  in December .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The decline in the share of categories with inflation over 3 percent indicates a decrease in inflationary pressures. This could potentially lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "That \u2019s good news because it indicates that broader inflationary pressure across the economy is easing.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it highlights the positive aspect of easing inflationary pressure, indicating a potential decrease in the need for aggressive tightening measures."}, {"sentence": "Now, here \u2019s why I am cautious about these latest res ults and why I am not ready yet to substantially alter my outlook for inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a cautious stance towards altering the outlook for inflation, indicating a neutral position on US monetary policy. The speaker is not ready to make significant changes, implying a neutral or possibly dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Month- over-month c ore CPI inflation actually ticked up in December from November and is pretty much where it was in October  and where it was in March when we began raising interest rates .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current core CPI inflation has increased slightly, but remains at a similar level as in previous months. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it does not provide a clear indication of whether the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should adopt a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Although inflation measured over 12 months has been falling, December\u2019s reading is still close to where it was a year ago.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. Despite the falling inflation over the past 12 months, the fact that December's reading remains close to the previous year implies a relatively stable inflation rate. Therefore, it does not provide a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Core inflation was 6 percent year over year (YOY) in January 2022 and was 5.7 percent  YOY last month .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates that core inflation has increased slightly from the previous month. While it does not explicitly state the implications on US monetary policy, this information could be seen as potentially hawkish, as it suggests a continued upward trend in inflation."}, {"sentence": "So, while it is possible to take a month or three months of data and paint a rosy picture , I caution against doing so.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or stance on the direction of interest rates or the overall stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). It simply advises against drawing overly optimistic conclusions based on short-term data."}, {"sentence": "T he shorter the trend, the larger the grain of salt when swallowing a story about the future.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the importance of skepticism when interpreting short-term trends and future predictions, without directly addressing any specific monetary policy stance or implications."}, {"sentence": "Back in 2021 , we saw three consecutive months of relatively low readings of core inflation before it jumped back up.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It highlights a temporary decrease in core inflation followed by an increase. However, without further context or indication of the FOMC's reaction, it remains irrelevant to determine whether the implications are hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "I will be looking for the recent improvement in headline and core inflation to continue .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker expects the recent improvement in both headline and core inflation to persist, indicating a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Wages, as I indicated earlier, are another stream of data that I will be watching for evidence of continued progress to help ease overall inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker is closely monitoring wages as an important indicator for assessing the progress of overall inflation. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it emphasizes the need for evidence of continued progress rather than indicating a specific hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Though recent hourly earnings  data are a positive development, I need to see more evidence of wage  - 6 - moderation to sustainable leve ls.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of needing more evidence of wage moderation indicates a cautious approach, implying a preference for maintaining current policy rather than making any immediate hawkish changes."}, {"sentence": "The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s Wage G rowth Tracker has been running higher lately and has moderated less.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish implication on US monetary policy. The fact that the Wage Growth Tracker has been running higher lately and has moderated less indicates a potential increase in wages, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This could prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish stance by considering tightening monetary policy to control inflation."}, {"sentence": "The employment cost index for December  won\u2019t be out until the end of this  month.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Reserve. It simply states that the employment cost index for December will be released at the end of the month."}, {"sentence": "Over time, we need to see wages grow more in line with productivity growth plus 2 percentage points , consistent with the FOMC\u2019s inflation target .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the need for wages to grow in line with productivity growth plus 2 percentage points, which indicates a desire to control inflation and maintain price stability."}, {"sentence": "Six months ago, when inflation was escalating and econ omic output had flattened, I argued that a soft landing was still possible \u2014that it was quite plausible  to make progress on inflation without seriously damaging the  labor market.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that despite escalating inflation and flattened economic output, the speaker believes in the possibility of achieving a soft landing, making progress on inflation without harming the labor market."}, {"sentence": "I believe that monetary policy should continue to tighten, but using a comparison I employed in a speech a couple months ago, the view from the cockpit  is very different at 30,000 feet tha n it is c lose to the ground.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the need for tightening, but emphasizes the difference in perspective between a broader view (30,000 feet) and a closer examination (close to the ground). This implies that the decision should be made cautiously, considering both hawkish and dovish factors."}, {"sentence": "When the FOMC began raising the federal funds rate last spring from near zero, it made sense to move quickly.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC's decision to raise the federal funds rate was justified when it started last spring. The use of the phrase \"move quickly\" implies a hawkish stance, indicating a more aggressive approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "But after front -loading monetary policy tightening, with many unprecedented  75 basis point  hikes  in the federal funds rate t arget , by early December I believed the policy stance was slightly restrictive , and I supported a decision by the Committee to hike  by a still considerable 50 basis points.2  To return to the airplane image, after climbing steeply and using monetary polic y to significantly raise interest rates throughout the economy, it was apparent to me that it was time to  slow, but not halt, the rate of ascent.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker believes the US monetary policy has been hawkish, as they mention front-loading monetary policy tightening and supporting a considerable 50 basis point hike. They also mention the need to slow the rate of ascent, indicating a shift towards a more neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "2 Each 75 basis point  hike was the largest rate single increase since the FOMC began announcing its rate decisions in 1994.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence implies a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it highlights the significant magnitude of the rate increase, indicating a more aggressive approach by the FOMC."}, {"sentence": "The Committee raised rates at individual meetings by larger amounts in the e arly 1980s, when it raised the federal funds rate to near 20 percent.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to current US monetary policy as it refers to the Committee's actions in the early 1980s.
