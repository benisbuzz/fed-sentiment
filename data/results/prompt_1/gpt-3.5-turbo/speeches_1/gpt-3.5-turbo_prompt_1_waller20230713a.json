It simply suggests that the FOMC members are present to gather information about the outlook, without specifying any policy implications."}, {"sentence": "\u201d1  Which is fine, because accurately communicating my economic outlook is an important part of my job.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that accurately communicating the economic outlook is important for the speaker's job. While it emphasizes the importance of communication, it does not provide any indication of whether the speaker's economic outlook is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant to US monetary policy. Therefore, the sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Tonight, i n addition to providing new informat ion about my outlook based on new data, I also want to clarify my views on how the economy has been operating over time and my view of appropriate monetary policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker intends to discuss their outlook based on new data and provide clarity on their views regarding the economy's performance and appropriate monetary policy. It is neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy as it does not explicitly lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Doing so can help the public anticipate how I will react to new developments, not just at t he next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) , but further into the future.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the importance of helping the public anticipate the speaker's reaction to future developments, indicating a cautious and accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "That\u2019s crucial, because monetary policy works mostly by influencing the public\u2019s view of financial and economic conditions well into the future, affect ing spending a nd investment decision s.  Whether I say so or not, every time I speak, I am trying to  better explain how and why I make policy decisions .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence highlights the importance of influencing the public's perception of financial and economic conditions for effective monetary policy. It suggests a dovish stance as it emphasizes the need to better explain policy decisions and aims to influence spending and investment decisions in the future."}, {"sentence": "First, by looking over the past few FOMC meetings, I want to describe  how my outlook has been shaped by both economic data and uncertainty \u2014what we have learned at each point  and what we don\u2019t yet know about the economy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the influence of economic data and uncertainty on their outlook, indicating a balanced approach. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if the statement leans towards a hawkish, dovish, or neutral bias."}, {"sentence": "Second, I w ill discuss how I think about lags with which policy a ffects economic activity and inflation and t he impact on the appropriate path of policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the speaker will address the timing of policy effects on economic activity and inflation, and how it influences the suitable policy trajectory. It is neutral as it does not explicitly express a hawkish or dovish stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "And third,  I will review t he recent data and discuss how I see policy evolving over the remainder of this year .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker will analyze recent data and provide insights on the future direction of monetary policy for the rest of the year. It is neutral as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish stance, but rather focuses on reviewing and discussing policy evolution."}, {"sentence": "Recent Policy Actions  At the June meeting, I supported keeping the policy rate unchanged.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence indicates a dovish stance on US monetary policy as the speaker supports maintaining the policy rate unchanged. It suggests a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy, reflecting a preference for maintaining accommodative measures."}, {"sentence": "Based only on the economic data that was coming in showing  a tight labor market and stubbornly  1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it is a disclaimer stating that the views expressed are personal and not representative of the Federal Open Market Committee. It does not provide any information regarding the stance of monetary policy, making it unrelated to being hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "- 2 -  high inflation , I believe that raising the policy rate 25 basis points was  justified.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"high inflation\" and the belief that raising the policy rate by 25 basis points was justified indicates a willingness to tighten monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "However, I had  lingering doubts about when or if an abrupt tig htening of credit conditions would occur.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a cautious stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"lingering doubts\" about a sudden tightening of credit conditions indicates a dovish sentiment, implying a preference for maintaining accommodative measures rather than implementing hawkish policies."}, {"sentence": "I viewed t he lingering effects of the banking stresses from March as a downside risk to cause a tightening of credit conditions.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the potential negative impact of banking stresses on credit conditions, indicating a concern for tightening monetary policy to mitigate these risks."}, {"sentence": "Although there did not appear to be a lot of evidence that a substantial credit crunch was in the works, I felt that waiting another six weeks was prudent risk management.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the absence of evidence for a credit crunch but still believes in exercising caution by waiting for another six weeks, indicating a preference for a more accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "In the end, I believed that risk management concerns slightly outweighed hiking bas ed on the incoming data.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker believes that the concerns regarding risk management are more significant than the possibility of raising interest rates, indicating a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I also felt more comfortable with this decision given that the median of the Summary  of Economic Projections (SEP) signaled  two additional rate hikes by the end of this year.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"two additional rate hikes\" indicates a willingness to tighten monetary policy, reflecting a more aggressive approach towards managing inflation and potentially signaling a less accommodative stance."}, {"sentence": "Early in March, p rior to the March FOMC meeting, I had planned to raise my terminal rate 50 basis points given the hot data that had come in at that point .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker had intended to increase the terminal rate by 50 basis points due to strong economic data. However, since it is mentioned as a past plan and not an actual decision made during the FOMC meeting, it is irrelevant to the current policy direction."}, {"sentence": "But then came the turmoil in the banking sector .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the stance or implications on interest rates or the economy. The mention of turmoil in the banking sector does not provide enough context to determine a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "My thought  was that credit conditions  were going to tighten a lot as a result of t he banking turmoil .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a concern about tightening credit conditions due to banking turmoil. It implies a potentially hawkish stance, as it indicates a belief that monetary policy may need to be more restrictive to address the tightening credit conditions."}, {"sentence": "I believed t his tightening  would effectively replace some of the tightening that otherwise would have been needed through monetary policy .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the tightening measures being implemented would potentially offset the need for further tightening through monetary policy, indicating a more aggressive approach towards managing the economy."}, {"sentence": "The net  result  was that  in the March SEP , I left my projection of the terminal policy rate unchanged from December.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy as the speaker mentions leaving their projection of the terminal policy rate unchanged. It implies that there is no shift towards a hawkish or dovish stance, making it irrelevant in terms of immediate policy implications."}, {"sentence": "But by June, there was little evidence that credit conditions were tightening more than would be expected as a result of monetary policy that had already tightened significantly.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that credit conditions in June did not show signs of tightening beyond what was anticipated due to the already significant tightening of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "This led me to believe policy needed to be tighter relative to what I thought in March.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a shift towards a more hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker's belief that policy needs to be tighter implies a preference for raising interest rates or reducing stimulus measures, indicating a less accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "So, I mark ed up my projected path for the federal funds rate at the end of 2023 by 50 basis points.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as the speaker mentions marking up their projected path for the federal funds rate, implying an expectation of higher interest rates by the end of 2023."}, {"sentence": "So why did I walk you through this evolution  of my thinking of th e appropriate setting of policy?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. It simply reflects the speaker's reasoning for discussing the evolution of their policy thinking."}, {"sentence": "First, it highlights how the appropriate setting for monetary policy shifts over time.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence is neutral as it simply acknowledges that the appropriate setting for monetary policy changes over time. It does not indicate whether the shift is hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Second, it shows that managing uncertainty and risks is a big part of my   - 3 -  job.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a specific stance or direction. It simply highlights the importance of managing uncertainty and risks, without expressing a hawkish, dovish, or neutral view."}, {"sentence": "Third, I hope it allows you to better consider how poli cymakers will adjust the setting of policy in response to incoming data going forward.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It implies that policymakers will closely analyze incoming data to make adjustments accordingly. It does not indicate a specific bias towards being hawkish or dovish, but rather emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making."}, {"sentence": "Monetary Policy Lags  A second issue  for the FOMC is how long it takes for changes in monetary policy to affect economic activity and inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is concerned about the time it takes for changes in monetary policy to have an impact on economic activity and inflation. It is neutral in terms of being hawkish or dovish, as it simply highlights a challenge faced by the FOMC."}, {"sentence": "As reported in the minut es of various FOMC meetings , the Committee often discusses these lags.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the stance or implications of the FOMC's discussions on these lags."}, {"sentence": "There is a wide range of views among researchers and  policymakers as to how long it takes for the full effect of monetary policy to register in the economy.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that there is no consensus among researchers and policymakers regarding the timing of the full impact of monetary policy on the economy. It is irrelevant to determine the stance of US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of whether it is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "What I would like to disc uss is expectations for  how long it will take for last year\u2019s sizable monetary policy tightening to show up in the  economic data .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates a focus on analyzing the impact of previous monetary policy tightening on economic data, without expressing a clear preference for a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "While there is no consensus on an exact length of time, traditional rules of thumb say that the maximum effect of a n unexpected  policy  change , what economists call a \u201cshock,\u201d  on the real economy is between 12 and 24 months .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence is neutral as it provides a general observation about the time frame for the maximum effect of an unexpected policy change on the real economy. It does not indicate any specific stance or direction for US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "There is tremendous uncertainty around this estimate.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the estimate mentioned is highly uncertain. As uncertainty can impact monetary policy decisions, it is relevant to the US monetary policy. However, it does not provide a clear indication of whether the policy will be hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Furthermore, commentary sometimes treats lagged effects as a \u201cWile  E. Coyote \u201d moment where no thing happens for a long time and then wham\u2026off the cliff we go as the full force of past policy actions suddenly take effect.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the treatment of lagged effects and does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance towards future policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "When  considering apply ing this 12- to 24 -month rule to last year\u2019s policy  actions , we need to ask two questions: (1) W hen did th e policy shock occur ?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of whether the policy actions were hawkish, dovish, or neutral. It simply discusses the timing of the policy shock and the need to ask questions related to it."}, {"sentence": "What I want to do in the next few minutes is push back against th e view  that the bulk of the  effects from last year\u2019s policy hikes have yet to hit the economy.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker intends to counter the belief that the full impact of previous policy hikes has not yet affected the economy. This implies a belief that the effects have already been felt, indicating a potential inclination towards further tightening measures."}, {"sentence": "Let me start by setting the stage with how the economic models that estimate these lags are developed.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the development of economic models and does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "Economists typically use linear or log -linear statistical models that capture how past   - 4 -  changes in a variable affect the current realization of that variable.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the statistical models used by economists to analyze past changes in a variable. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The impact of past realizations of an economic variable on current values is estimated using constant coefficients.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses a methodological approach for estimating the impact of past economic variables on current values, without providing any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "For example, if gross domestic product  (GDP ) increased  at a 1 percent  annual rate last quarter, a model might estimate that 0.9 of that increase will carry through to GDP  in the current quarter  and .8 of it will carry forward into the next quarter .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the stance or direction of the policy. It simply discusses a hypothetical model's estimation of the carry-through and carry-forward effects of GDP growth."}, {"sentence": "These estimate s of 0.9 and 0.8 are  constant across time and are independent of how big the change is in GDP last quarter \u2014if last quarter\u2019s GDP increased at a 2 percent  rate, 0.9 of that would carry through to the current quarter  and 0.8 of it would carry forward into the next quarter .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the stance being hawkish, dovish, or neutral. It simply explains the constant estimates of 0.9 and 0.8, which remain unaffected by changes in GDP."}, {"sentence": "In short, the speed at which past changes feed into current and future values does not change over time and does not depend on the size of past changes.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the speed at which past changes affect current and future values remains constant and is not influenced by the magnitude of those past changes."}, {"sentence": "Once these models are estimated using histor ical data, t he policy exercise then is to feed an unexpected , temporary 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate into this system of linear equations and simulate the effects on key economic variables.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It describes a policy exercise of feeding an unexpected, temporary increase in the federal funds rate into models estimated using historical data to simulate its effects on economic variables."}, {"sentence": "The idea is to capture a causal response of the economy to the policy shock.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the objective of capturing the cause-and-effect relationship between the economy and policy shock, without indicating a specific inclination towards hawkish or dovish actions."}, {"sentence": "Based on this process, we can trace out the change over time in a variable , say GDP.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance. It simply discusses a process of tracing changes in a variable over time, such as GDP, without expressing any hawkish, dovish, or neutral views."}, {"sentence": "Typically, these impulse response functions illustrate how the variables move relativ e to their long -run values.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses impulse response functions and the movement of variables relative to their long-run values, without providing any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "The impulse response functions are normally hump -shaped \u2014there is a  small effect  initially and the effect grows over time with the maximal impact occurring  several quarters after the policy surprise .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the impulse response functions in US monetary policy have a delayed and gradually increasing impact over time, with the maximum effect occurring several quarters after a policy surprise. This information is relevant for assessing the effectiveness of monetary policy decisions and their potential impact on the economy, but it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "After th e peak impact, the effect of the policy change on the real economy fades away , with the variables return ing to their long run steady state values.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the policy change's impact on the real economy diminishes over time, returning variables to their long-term steady state values. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it does not indicate any inclination towards being hawkish or dovish."}, {"sentence": "The hump -shaped impulse response function illustrates that there are lagged effects from a policy surprise.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the hump-shaped impulse response function and lagged effects from a policy surprise, without providing any indication of whether it is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "There are a wide v ariety of   - 5 -  statistical models one can use for this exercise but looking across these models, one gets the rule of thumb that the maximal effects of monetary policy changes will hit the economy with a 12 -month to 24 -month lag.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses statistical models and the time lag of monetary policy effects. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "First, the hump -shaped response means there are no \u201ccliff effects \u201d\u2014a policy change  is not associated with a long period of no effect  that is then followed by an abrupt change in the variable.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral implication on US monetary policy. The hump-shaped response indicates that policy changes do not result in long periods of no effect followed by abrupt changes, which implies a more balanced and gradual approach rather than being hawkish or dovish."}, {"sentence": "Second, economic variables res pond sluggishly to unexpected policy changes  and the sluggishness is what generates a lagged response to a policy action.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the response of economic variables to unexpected policy changes is slow, resulting in a delayed reaction to policy actions. This implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it highlights the inherent lag in the system rather than indicating a specific hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "There are many explanations as to why households and businesses respond sluggishly, such as adjustment costs, sticky prices and wages , nominal contracts, habit persistence in consumption , or the fact that there is an option value of waiting  when deciding to invest .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence highlights various factors that contribute to sluggish responses from households and businesses. It is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "First, when did the policy shock occur?", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information related to the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or its implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In these statistical models, it occurs when there is an  unexpected change in the federal funds rate.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it merely describes the occurrence of an unexpected change in the federal funds rate within statistical models. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "In short, from the point of view of the model, the FOMC wakes up one morning and surprises markets with a 25 -basis point hike.2  While this is a fun exercise to see what happens, it doesn\u2019t really capture how monetary policy works  in practice .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it describes a hypothetical scenario that does not reflect the actual workings of monetary policy. It acknowledges that the model's approach of surprising markets with a 25-basis point hike is a fun exercise but does not capture the reality of how monetary policy operates."}, {"sentence": "Only rarely do policymakers try to surprise markets, and in fact , we usually specify  our policy intentions well ahead of time through the use of forward gui dance.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the policymakers generally adopt a dovish approach by providing forward guidance and avoiding surprising the markets. It implies that the US monetary policy tends to be transparent and predictable, which can help maintain stability and manage market expectations."}, {"sentence": "As I said earlier, forward guidance is one of the purposes of this speech.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that forward guidance is an important aspect of the speech, indicating a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the speaker intends to provide information and direction regarding future policy actions, without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Forward guidance is used to signal future policy actions  and,  2 Typically,  economists look at the difference between the actual policy rate change and the expected change from federal funds rate f utures.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that forward guidance is an important tool used by the FOMC to communicate future policy actions. Economists typically analyze the variance between the actual policy rate change and the expected change from federal funds rate futures. This information is relevant for monetary policy decisions, but it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "So, if the FOMC raised the policy rate by 25 -basis point s and the market expected a 10 -basis point  hike ( meaning the market pricing reflect ed a 40 percent probability of a 25 basis point hike and 60 percent probability of no change ) this would corr espond to a policy surprise of 15 basis points .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that if the FOMC raised the policy rate by 25 basis points, which is higher than the market's expectation of a 10 basis point hike, it would result in a policy surprise of 15 basis points. This implies a hawkish stance by the FOMC, as they are more aggressive in tightening monetary policy than what the market anticipated."}, {"sentence": "- 6 -  when it is credible, financial markets price those expected actions into today\u2019s interest rates .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence implies that the credibility of expected actions influences the pricing of interest rates in financial markets. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it highlights the importance of market expectations, which can have a dovish, hawkish, or neutral impact on policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "By instantly  pricing in future policy , promised rate hikes immediately  affect  many of the cost s of financing for households and firms , even though the actual policy rate hasn\u2019t moved.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that promised rate hikes have an immediate impact on the costs of financing for households and firms, despite the actual policy rate remaining unchanged. It implies a hawkish stance as the market is reacting to future policy expectations rather than current policy actions."}, {"sentence": "As a result, policy tightening occurs with the announcement  of policy tightening, not when the rate change actually happens .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It suggests that the timing of policy tightening is more focused on the announcement rather than the actual rate change, indicating a cautious approach to avoid surprising the market."}, {"sentence": "As an illustration, look at how the two-year Treasury yield moved between late 2021 and March 2022, a time when the FOMC was talking about lifting the policy target range above zero.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance by the FOMC as it refers to the potential increase in the policy target range above zero. The movement of the two-year Treasury yield during this period serves as an illustration of the FOMC's intention to tighten monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I have argued in the past that the  two-year Treasury yield is a good proxy for the stance of monetary policy and captures announcement effects.3  The 2 -year  yield went from 25 basis points in September 2021 to around 200 basis points by the March 2022 FOMC meeting.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the increase in the two-year Treasury yield from 25 basis points to around 200 basis points by the March 2022 FOMC meeting indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Even tho ugh we had not raised the policy rate  nor did we get the policy rate up to 200 basis point s until August 2022 , the markets priced in a nearly 200 basis point  increase in the expected policy rate before we actually raised it.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the markets anticipated a significant increase in the policy rate even before it was raised, indicating a hawkish sentiment. However, it is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses market expectations rather than the actual policy decisions made by the FOMC."}, {"sentence": "This forward guidance effectively shave d off about 6 months from the usual 12 - to 24-month lag that one might conjecture would be needed to see the 200 basis points of actual tightening affect the economy .4  That is, forward guidance shortens the lag time between when the policy rate changes and when the effects of actual policy tightening occur .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the forward guidance implemented by the FOMC has a hawkish implication on US monetary policy. It indicates that the usual lag time for the effects of tightening to be seen in the economy has been reduced from 12-24 months to approximately 6 months."}, {"sentence": "Now let me turn to the second question , whether the size of the shock matters for estimating lags in policy.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the estimation of lags in policy and does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "In the standard linear model s used for these exercises, the size  3 See Christopher J.

It does not provide any information on whether the policy stance is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "The size of the shock basically  scales the effect proportionately without changing the timing of when past changes affect current values of a variable.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the stance or direction of the policy. It discusses the impact of shock size on the timing and proportionality of changes in a variable, but does not address the hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance of the policy."}, {"sentence": "What I am going to argue is that the size of the shock may lead to change s in econ omic behavior that change  the coefficients in the statistical model s.  In less jargony words , the degree  of sluggish behavior of economic variables to a policy surprise is not constant but can change with the size and nature of the shock.5 There are a lot of reasons to think that \u201cbig shocks travel fast ,\u201d meaning they elicit a change in economic behavior that would not be associated with  small shocks.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the size and nature of shocks can impact the behavior of economic variables, potentially leading to changes in the coefficients of statistical models. It implies that big shocks may have a greater effect on economic behavior compared to small shocks.
