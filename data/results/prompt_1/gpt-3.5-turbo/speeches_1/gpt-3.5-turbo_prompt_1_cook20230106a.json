It implies a neutral stance as it does not explicitly indicate whether the speaker's views lean towards being hawkish or dovish on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I want to use my time to outline the unique se t of challenges facing policymakers and academics today  as well as how we can better understand inflation dynamics in this new environment , including by looking at novel data sources.1   The effects of the pandemic and Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine have tu rned a  spotlight on the supply side of the economy and its ability to adapt to rapid changes in demand and to navigate a seemingly never -ending sequence of adverse supply shocks.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it focuses on the challenges facing policymakers and academics, as well as understanding inflation dynamics in a new environment. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The unique nature of the supply and demand imbalances  over the past couple of  years has made it more difficult to forecast inflation , pos ing new  challenges for monetary policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the supply and demand imbalances have created difficulties in forecasting inflation, which implies that the current situation is uncertain. It highlights the challenges faced by monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance as it does not explicitly lean towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "One way to better manage these challenges is by continu ing to monitor \u2014and even expand\u2014new  sources of data.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of monitoring and potentially expanding new sources of data to effectively address challenges.

It simply acknowledges the existence of key issues in approaching revised models of inflation behavior, without expressing a hawkish, dovish, or neutral view."}, {"sentence": "Before I turn to broader issues with modeling inflation , let me start with the recent inflation data.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance. It merely suggests that the speaker will discuss inflation data, without expressing a hawkish, dovish, or neutral view."}, {"sentence": "Inflation remains far too high, despite some encouraging signs late ly, and  1 These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it explicitly states that the views expressed are personal and do not reflect the stance of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee."}, {"sentence": "In the original version, the line intending to show the price index for core PCE services ex.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."}, {"sentence": "housing was instead showing the price index for core PCE services.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or implications related to the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

The Fed policymaker expresses commitment to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent goal, suggesting a willingness to implement accommodative measures to stimulate the economy if needed."}, {"sentence": "The 12- month change in total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices through November was 5 .5 percent.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or implication regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) towards interest rates or the economy."}, {"sentence": "Core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent over the same 12 -month period (figure 1).", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates that Core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent over a 12-month period. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it provides insight into inflationary pressures. If the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) considers this increase concerning and believes it may require action to curb inflation, it could be seen as hawkish."}, {"sentence": "This measure omits volatile food and energy prices and tends to give a more accurate signal of total inflation\u2019s trajectory .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The measure mentioned aims to provide a more accurate indication of overall inflation, indicating a focus on stability rather than a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "However, monthly data are quite volatile, so I would caution against putting too much weight on the past few favorable monthly data reports.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the volatility of monthly data and advises against overemphasizing recent positive reports, indicating a cautious approach."}, {"sentence": "The high and volatile inflation seen over the past two years appears to reflect rapid shifts in dema nd, coupled with supply- chain disruptions.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the high and volatile inflation in the past two years is likely a result of rapid shifts in demand and supply-chain disruptions. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it does not explicitly indicate a preference for either hawkish or dovish actions."}, {"sentence": "This has led to sizable demand\u2013supply imbalances across different sectors.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that there are significant imbalances between the demand and supply in various sectors. While it does not directly address US monetary policy, it implies that the current economic conditions may require a response from the Federal Reserve. Therefore, it can be considered relevant to US monetary policy, but it does not provide a clear indication of whether the policy stance would be hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "To analyze these influences, I find it useful to consider  core inflation in three categories corresponding to distinct components of consumer spending:  core goods inflation, housing services inflation, and inflation in core services other than housing (figure 2).", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is taking a neutral stance on US monetary policy by analyzing the influences on core inflation in different categories of consumer spending. It does not indicate a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "In contrast to core goods inflation, which has declined  over the past year, housing services inflation has continued to rise r apidly, and inflation in other core services has been little changed on balance.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The continued rapid rise in housing services inflation indicates potential inflationary pressures, while the little change in inflation for other core services implies a neutral outlook. The declining core goods inflation is irrelevant to the current policy implications."}, {"sentence": "In the current environment, I find it helpful to examine  a number of somewhat new indicators when assessing inflation pressures within each category.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the importance of considering new indicators to assess inflation pressures, indicating a willingness to adapt the approach.

It implies that the Federal Reserve might consider maintaining or even loosening its accommodative stance to support economic recovery."}, {"sentence": "Fortunately,  - 3 - many indicators suggest that shortages of inputs have abate d, and transportation costs have started to fall.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the US economy, indicating that input shortages have decreased and transportation costs are declining. These developments are likely to have a dovish effect on US monetary policy as they alleviate inflationary pressures and may reduce the need for aggressive tightening measures."}, {"sentence": "For example, the list of industrial inputs that respondents to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) manufacturing survey indicate are in short supply is now shorter than it was at its peak  at the end of 2021 (figure 3).", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The decrease in the list of industrial inputs in short supply indicates a potential easing of inflationary pressures, which could lead to a more accommodative stance by the Federal Reserve."}, {"sentence": "Supply constraints are far from fully resolved, however, and respondents to the December ISM survey still rep orted difficulty procuring items such as electrical and hydraulic components, rubber and steel products, and\u2014of course \u2014semiconductors.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that supply constraints are still present in the US economy, as reported by respondents to the December ISM survey. These constraints include difficulty in procuring various items. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it indicates a potential risk to economic growth and could influence the Federal Reserve's decision-making.

It suggests that the Federal Reserve is monitoring the constraints on goods production, including shortages of materials and other inputs. However, it does not provide a clear indication of whether this information has any immediate implications on US monetary policy. Therefore, the sentence is irrelevant to determining the stance of US monetary policy as hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "These data show a decline over the past year in the number of plants that continue to operate below full capacity due to logistical challenges as well as parts or labor shortages.3  Yet t hose readings remained quite elevated in the third quarter of last year re lative to rates observed before the pandemic.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that although there has been a decline in the number of plants operating below full capacity due to challenges, the readings in the third quarter of last year were still high compared to pre-pandemic levels.

However, it does not provide any direct implications on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in terms of determining a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "However, the hous ing services index tends to adjust quite slowly, as it measures the rise in rents for all tenants, including those with continuing leases, and the rise in the rental -equivalent cost of owner -occupied housing.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the housing services index and its slow adjustment. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Changes in the rental market are reflected in measures of average rents with a lag.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses changes in the rental market and their reflection in average rents with a lag. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Partly for this reason, I find it useful to consult market rents paid for new leases, which are a more timely indicator of how housing services prices are likely to change over the next 6 to 12 months ( figure 5).", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The speaker finds it useful to consider market rents as an indicator of future changes in housing services prices. However, it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Ava ilable measures of market rents suggest that the price increases for new tenant leases have slowed substantially over the past year .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the slowing price increases for new tenant leases, as indicated by market rents, may have implications on US monetary policy. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this information is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "This pattern may in part reflect the easing of som e special factors that shifted demand during the peak of the pandemic, such as the surge in work from home and the associated increase in demand for bigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from city centers.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the observed pattern may be influenced by temporary factors related to the pandemic, such as the shift in demand for larger homes in suburban areas. However, it does not provide any clear indication of a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance."}, {"sentence": "Because these shifts in demand ha ppened much more rapidly than the response in housing supply, rents increased quite significantly, especially for single -family detached homes.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses shifts in demand and housing supply, which are not directly related to the monetary policy stance."}, {"sentence": "Some of this shift in demand may have stabilized over the past year as the pandemic has waned, amenities and cu ltural activities in urban areas have re -opened, and more workers have returned to the office (figure 6).", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the shift in demand may have stabilized due to the waning pandemic, reopening of amenities and cultural activities, and workers returning to the office. However, it does not provide any direct implications on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether the policy stance is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Although PCE housing services prices will likely increase further in the coming months as renters renew their leases, the deceleration in market rents suggests this process should slow appreciably over the course of this year.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. While PCE housing services prices are expected to rise due to lease renewals, the deceleration in market rents indicates a potential slowdown. This information does not provide a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Lastly, inflation in other core services \u2014a large category that covers activities as varied as travel and recreation to medical and legal services \u2014has remained stubbornly  - 5 - high.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that inflation in other core services has remained persistently high. This could be seen as a hawkish signal for US monetary policy, as it indicates potential concerns about rising prices and the need for tighter monetary measures to control inflation."}, {"sentence": "As my colleagues and I have noted in the past, an important source of inflation pressures in this category is the shortage of workers, which has pushed up labor costs at rates above those consistent with 2 percent inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges that the shortage of workers has led to increased labor costs, which could potentially contribute to inflation pressures. This implies that the Federal Reserve might consider tightening monetary policy to curb inflationary risks."}, {"sentence": "The inflation outlook for t his non -housing category of core services partly depends on whether growth in nominal labor costs comes back down, and recent data suggest that labor -compensation growth has indeed started to decelerate somewhat over the past year.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of labor-compensation growth decelerating implies that inflationary pressures may ease, indicating a potential need for accommodative measures."}, {"sentence": "In addition to keeping close tabs on measures of labor costs, I have found it valuable  to use  some high -frequency indicators of services spending, particularly in the leisure & hospitality and travel sectors (figure 7).", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of using high-frequency indicators of services spending, specifically in the leisure & hospitality and travel sectors, indicates a focus on monitoring economic recovery and potential inflationary pressures. This approach aligns with a cautious and accommodative stance, which is characteristic of a dovish monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Even as the effects of the pandemic overall appear to be subsiding, the ebbs and flows in the spread of the COVID -19 virus (in addition to other respiratory viruses) continue to add significant volatility to monthly inflation readings in these sectors.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the ongoing fluctuations in the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses are contributing to significant volatility in monthly inflation readings. However, it does not provide a clear indication of the stance on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in terms of its implications."}, {"sentence": "Crucially, we must be vigilant to ensure that pandemic -era co st pressures and disruptions do not  have lasting effects on inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The use of the word \"vigilant\" implies a cautious approach to prevent lasting effects on inflation, indicating a concern about potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "If cost shocks and supply disruptions keep inflation elevated for a long enough period, households \u2019 and firms \u2019 inflation expectations coul d move higher \u2014a development  that could put additional upward pressure on inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that if cost shocks and supply disruptions continue to cause high inflation for a prolonged period, it could lead to an increase in households' and firms' inflation expectations. This development could potentially exert additional upward pressure on inflation. Therefore, the implications of this sentence on US monetary policy are hawkish, as it highlights the need for measures to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Accordingly, I look at a variety of  measures of inflation expectations \u2014near - and long- term, as well as survey - and market -based \u2014that cover many different participants in the economy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker considers a wide range of inflation expectation measures, including short-term and long-term indicators from surveys and market-based sources. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it focuses on gathering comprehensive data from various participants in the economy."}, {"sentence": "Since the onset of the pandemic, m edians of many surveys of longer -run measures suggest that inflation expectations are still within their pre -pandemic ranges, despite having come up a little .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that inflation expectations have remained relatively stable within their pre-pandemic ranges, despite a slight increase. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it indicates a neutral stance, neither hawkish nor dovish, regarding inflation expectations."}, {"sentence": "This is  consistent with overall PCE price  increases declining  to a 2 percent pace.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates that the overall Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price increases are declining to a 2 percent pace. This implies that there may not be a need for a hawkish approach to control inflation, making it relevant to the current monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Market -based  measures of inflation compensation beyond  - 6 - the near term, such as those derived from T reasury I nflation -Protected S ecurities , or TIPS, tell a similar story.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that market-based measures of inflation compensation, specifically derived from TIPS, align with the near-term outlook. It implies that these measures are relevant for assessing inflation expectations, which could have implications for US monetary policy. However, it does not explicitly indicate whether the implications are hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "I have also looked beyond the headlines of the survey data to assess how inflation expectations are  moving and responding to the current high- inflation environment.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker is closely monitoring inflation expectations and their response to the current high-inflation environment. It indicates a hawkish stance as the speaker is actively analyzing data beyond the headlines, implying a cautious approach towards potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "For example, in the Michigan Surveys  of Consumers, we can compare households\u2019 perceptions of past inflation to their expectations of future inflation at the 1-year and 5-to-10-year horizons  (figure 8).", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses a comparison of households' perceptions of past and future inflation in the Michigan Surveys of Consumers. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The comparisons show that while households have raised their inflation expectations over the past few years, especially for the short- term measure, the increases were far less than one -for-one with how much they perceived inflation had alread y risen.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that households have increased their inflation expectations, but the increases have been less than proportional to their perception of inflation. This implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy, as it indicates that inflation expectations are not rising rapidly enough to warrant immediate tightening measures."}, {"sentence": "Any de-anchoring of expectations would be a major concern, as it could cause the high inflation that we have been experiencing to prove more persistent.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the concern of any de-anchoring of expectations, indicating a strong commitment to maintaining price stability and avoiding persistent high inflation."}, {"sentence": "Looking ahead, the outlook for inflation will depend, in part, on how the factors restraining supply responses and boosting cost pressures in each of these three main PCE price categories play out.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the future inflation outlook will be influenced by the interplay between factors that limit supply responses and increase cost pressures in different price categories. It is neutral as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I think it is quite possible that the organization of production and supply chains will look different in the coming years from the way they did before the pandemic, as firms evaluate some newly exposed tradeoffs between keeping costs low and supplies available.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the potential changes in production and supply chains post-pandemic, highlighting firms' evaluation of tradeoffs between cost reduction and supply availability. However, it does not directly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We should  also advance our understanding of how an environment of more  frequent disruptions to the production and distribution systems will affect potential output, feed into inflation, and become an import ant element in forecasting inflation, assessing risks, and adjusting monetary policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the need to enhance understanding of disruptions' impact on potential output, inflation, and forecasting, which implies a cautious approach.

It emphasizes the importance of furthering understanding of inflation and its causal relationships, as well as improving risk forecasting abilities. However, it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance."}, {"sentence": "Progress in these areas would help us  better assess developments in real time.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that progress in certain areas would assist in improving the evaluation of real-time developments. However, it does not provide any indication of a specific stance on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in terms of its implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "As sectoral supply \u2013demand imbalances have played a key role in understanding inflation in r ecent years, would adopting a model  with multiple price components  improve our understanding of and ability to forecast overall inflation ?", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the importance of sectoral supply-demand imbalances in understanding inflation but questions whether adopting a model with multiple price components would enhance the understanding and forecasting of overall inflation."}, {"sentence": "Relatedly, should we look to inflation models with nonlinear or threshold effects, which could capture, among other things, supply constraints ?", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of exploring inflation models with nonlinear or threshold effects indicates a willingness to consider alternative approaches to understanding supply constraints, but it does not explicitly lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "The pandemic has had a much more prolonged effect on labor supply than many expected, and rapid nominal wage growth has accompanied the recent rise in inflation in ways that traditional measures of labor market tightness \u2014such as the unemployment rate gap \u2014might not be capturing.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the pandemic's impact on labor supply has been longer-lasting than anticipated, and the recent inflation rise is accompanied by significant wage growth. It implies that traditional labor market indicators like the unemployment rate gap may not fully reflect the situation. These observations are relevant to US monetary policy as they provide insights into the current economic conditions, potentially influencing the Fed's decision-making. However, the sentence does not explicitly lean towards a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "Many analysts have u sed data on job vacancies to go beyond a simple unemployment  rate gap indicator, and I see merit in such approaches.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.

It emphasizes the need to comprehend the interplay between inflation, inflation expectations, and the long-term inflation rate, once temporary shocks have subsided. It does not explicitly lean towards a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance."}, {"sentence": "Finally, we should consider if there are ways to better anticipate structural breaks in the inflation process.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the FOMC is acknowledging the need to improve their ability to predict significant changes in the inflation process, without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "For example, inflation could become  a nonstationary time -series process if inflation expectations were to become de -anchored.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that if inflation expectations were to become de-anchored, it could lead to a nonstationary time-series process for inflation. This implies a potential risk of rising inflation, which could have hawkish implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "When the economy is disrupted by a once -in-a-century event, there is no such thing as too much data and too much analysis.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that during a major economic disruption, policymakers believe it is crucial to gather extensive data and conduct thorough analysis, indicating a cautious and accommodative approach to decision-making."}]
