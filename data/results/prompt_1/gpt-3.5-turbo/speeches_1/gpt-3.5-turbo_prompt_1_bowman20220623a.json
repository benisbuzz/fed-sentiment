[{"sentence": "For release on delivery  11:00 a.m. EDT June 23, 20 22         The Outlook for Inflation and Monetary Policy    Remarks by   Michelle  W. Bowman   Member   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System   at  Executive Officers Conference   Massachusetts Bankers Association   Harwich, Massachusetts         June 23, 20 22   Thank you to the Massachusetts Bankers Association for the opportunity to speak to you today.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any information or indication about the stance of the Federal Reserve, whether it is hawkish, dovish, or neutral. It simply expresses gratitude for the opportunity to speak at the Executive Officers Conference."}, {"sentence": "It is often good to get away from Washington to gain some perspective, and it\u2019s always worthwhile for me when I can get some perspective from bankers.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or insight into the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding interest rates or the economy. It simply expresses a personal preference for gaining perspective from bankers outside of Washington."}, {"sentence": "I will to uch on some of the banking issues I expect are  on your minds, but one of the biggest issues for everyone right now is inflation, what the Fed is doing to get inflation under control, and the implications for your businesses, your customers, and your communities.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker acknowledges the importance of inflation and its implications for businesses, customers, and communities. However, it does not provide any specific indication of the speaker's stance on monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether the statement is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Inflation is the highest we have seen in the United States  in 40 years and so far  it shows little sign of moderating.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The high inflation rate, the highest in 40 years, and the lack of signs of moderation indicate a potential need for tighter monetary measures to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "At the same time, the econom y is growing  at a moderate pace, and the labor market is extremely tight , as indicated by a variety of  measures including reports of many employers unable to find workers despite significantly raising wages.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of the economy growing at a moderate pace and the extremely tight labor market, despite employers raising wages, indicates potential inflationary pressures. This could imply a need for tighter monetary policy to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "That tightness  is contributing to inflation, because labor is the largest input cost for producing goods and providing services.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the tightness in the labor market is contributing to inflation, indicating a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may consider tightening monetary policy to address this inflationary pressure."}, {"sentence": "Inflation is a significant challenge for everyone, but it hits lower - and moderate -income people the hardest, since they spend a larger share of their incomes on necessities and often have less savings to fall back on.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence highlights the impact of inflation on lower and moderate-income individuals, who are disproportionately affected due to their higher expenditure on necessities and limited savings. Although it acknowledges the challenge, it does not directly address the stance of US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Inflation is also a burden for businesses that must som ehow balance unpredictable costs while setting  prices that aren\u2019t so high that they discourage customers from purchasing.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence highlights the challenge businesses face in managing inflationary pressures and pricing their products. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it does not explicitly indicate a preference for either hawkish or dovish measures."}, {"sentence": "Inflation that continues at these levels is a threat to sustained e mployment growth and to the overall health of the economy.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The concern about inflation as a threat to employment growth and the overall health of the economy implies a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "The inflation data  show that , after moderating slightly for a short time, price increases for motor vehicles have picked up again, energy prices rose sharply in May, and prices for food have risen more than 10 percent from a year ago.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of rising prices for motor vehicles, energy, and food indicates an increase in inflationary pressures. This could imply a need for tighter monetary policy to control inflation."}, {"sentence": "The inflationary effect from the invasion of Ukraine has proven to be lasting for both energy and food  - 2 - commodity prices, with little prospect of the conflict or those price pressures abating very soon.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The lasting inflationary effect from the invasion of Ukraine, particularly on energy and food prices, indicates a potential need for tighter monetary measures to control inflationary pressures in the economy."}, {"sentence": "More broadly, global supply chain issues continue, in part because of the effe ct of ongoing COVID -19 lockdown policies in China that have slowed production and shipping.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses global supply chain issues caused by COVID-19 lockdown policies in China. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "One important factor that we often point to in driving today\u2019s spending decisions and inflation outlook are expectations of future inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC considers expectations of future inflation as an important factor in driving spending decisions and inflation outlook. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it acknowledges the relevance of inflation expectations without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Near -term expectation s tend to rise as current inflation increases, but when inflation expectations over the longer -term \u2014 the next 5 to 10 years \u2014begin to rise, it may indicate  that consumers and businesses have less confidence in the Fed\u2019s ability to address higher inflation a nd return it to the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) goal of 2 percent .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that rising inflation expectations in the near-term are expected, which could be seen as hawkish. However, if inflation expectations over the longer-term also increase, it may indicate a lack of confidence in the Fed's ability to control inflation, which could be seen as dovish."}, {"sentence": "If expectations move significantly above  our 2 percent goal, i t would make it more difficult to change people\u2019s perceptions about the duration of high inflation and potentially more difficult to get inflation under control.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that if expectations of inflation surpass the 2 percent goal, it could be challenging to alter people's perception of prolonged high inflation and control inflation effectively."}, {"sentence": "As we see surveys like the Michigan survey report higher longer -term inflation expectations, we need to pay close attention and continue to use our tools to address inflation before these indicators rise further or expectations of higher inflation become entrenched.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC acknowledges the rise in longer-term inflation expectations and emphasizes the need to closely monitor and address inflation using their tools before it escalates further or becomes firmly established."}, {"sentence": "As I mentioned earlier, one force driving inflation is the extremely tight labor market.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC acknowledges the impact of the tight labor market on inflation. It implies a hawkish stance as it recognizes a potential inflationary pressure, indicating a possibility of a more aggressive monetary policy to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "The benefits from a tight labor market are easy to see\u2014the U.S. economy continued to add jobs at a pace of  400,000 per month for the p ast three months, which is remarkable considering the low number of people looking for work.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a tight labor market and the remarkable job growth indicate a strong economy. This could imply that the Federal Reserve may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and inflation."}, {"sentence": "Today, most people  who want to work can find a job, and wages and salaries have risen faster than they have in decades.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the current state of employment and wage growth, which does not directly impact the decision-making process of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding interest rates or other monetary policy tools."}, {"sentence": "Even with the se gains, wages have not kept pace with inflation, which has  - 3 - made it much more difficult for many workers to make ends meet in the face of soaring housing, energy,  and food costs.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the concern that wages have not kept up with inflation, making it challenging for workers to meet their expenses. This implies a need for accommodative measures to address the rising costs of housing, energy, and food."}, {"sentence": "Job creation signals strong labor market demand, particularly in the curre nt environment , with a  large number of  available jobs and fewer job seekers.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The strong labor market demand indicated by job creation and the imbalance between available jobs and job seekers imply that the Federal Reserve may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "In addition, the tightness of the labor market is exacerbated by a labor force participation rate that remains far below the pre-pandemic benchmark, representing millions of workers sitting on the sidelines.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The reference to a tight labor market and low labor force participation rate indicates that there is still significant slack in the economy, making it irrelevant to consider tightening monetary policy at this time."}, {"sentence": "Many of  these are early retirees , some incentivized to retire during the pandemic , and those with family caregiving challenges  including very high costs for childcare.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses early retirees, incentivized retirement during the pandemic, and family caregiving challenges. These factors do not directly impact the hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance of US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "While the strong job market has brought some of these workers back into the workforce, it seem s that many are still waiting or may not return, meaning that labor shortages will likely persist in many sectors of the economy.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite the strong job market, there are still workers who are hesitant to rejoin the workforce, leading to potential labor shortages. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it indicates a potential need for a dovish approach to stimulate labor market participation and address the persisting labor shortages."}, {"sentence": "I\u2019ve laid out many of the challenges, so now let me talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing to get inflation under control.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker is acknowledging the challenges and intends to discuss the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to manage inflation. It is neutral in terms of US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "In the face of inflation  that continues to be much too high and in light of the recent high readings, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points  at our most recent meeting last week.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC's decision to raise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points indicates a tightening of monetary policy in response to persistently high inflation, reflecting a more aggressive approach to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "That increase followed two rate hikes totaling 75 bas is points earlier this year, and we indicated that further increases will likely be appropriate in the months ahead.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of previous rate hikes and the indication of further increases in the future imply a tightening approach, reflecting a willingness to combat inflationary pressures and potentially slow down economic growth."}, {"sentence": "On June 1, the Fed took a separate step to tighten monetary policy by beginning to reduce its large balance sheet of securities holdings.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The Fed's decision to reduce its balance sheet implies a tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a more hawkish approach aimed at controlling inflation and potentially raising interest rates."}, {"sentence": "I strongly supported the FOMC\u2019s decision last week, and I expect to support additional rate increases until we see significant progress toward bringing inflation down.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker expresses strong support for the FOMC's decision and expects to continue supporting rate increases until inflation decreases significantly, suggesting a willingness to tighten monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Based on current inflation readings, I expect that an additional rate increase of 75 b asis points will be appropriate at our next meeting as well as increases of at least 50 basis  - 4 - point s in the next few subsequent meetings, as long as the incoming data support them .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker expects an additional rate increase of 75 basis points at the next meeting and further increases in subsequent meetings, as long as the data supports it."}, {"sentence": "Depending on how the economy evolves, further increases in the target rang e for the federal funds rate may be needed after that.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that if the economy continues to improve, there may be a need for additional increases in the target range for the federal funds rate in the future."}, {"sentence": "The case for further rate hikes is made stronger by the current level of the \u201creal\u201d federal funds rate, which is the difference between the nominal rate and near -term inflation expectations.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the current level of the \"real\" federal funds rate, which considers inflation expectations, strengthens the argument for additional rate hikes."}, {"sentence": "With inf lation much higher than the federal funds rate, the real federal funds rate is negative, even after our rate increases this year.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Despite rate increases, the real federal funds rate remains negative due to higher inflation. This indicates a cautious approach, as the central bank may prioritize supporting economic growth over tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Since  inflation is unacceptably high, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have the nominal federal funds rate below near -term inflation expectations.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the current nominal federal funds rate should be increased to align with near-term inflation expectations, indicating a concern about high inflation levels."}, {"sentence": "I am therefore committed to a policy that will bring the real federal funds rate back into positive territory .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The commitment to bring the real federal funds rate back into positive territory suggests a tightening of monetary policy to control inflation, which aligns with a more hawkish approach."}, {"sentence": "While I expect that the labor market will remain strong  as the FOMC continues to tighten monetary policy, these actions do not come without risk.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it acknowledges the FOMC's intention to tighten policy due to a strong labor market. However, it also acknowledges the presence of risks, indicating a slightly dovish tone. Overall, the sentence implies a cautious approach to tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "But in my view, our number one responsibility is to reduce inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the priority of reducing inflation. It implies that the speaker believes controlling inflation should be the primary focus, indicating a potential inclination towards tighter monetary measures."}, {"sentence": "Maintaining our commitment to restore price stability is the best course to support a sustainably  strong labor market.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. By emphasizing the commitment to restore price stability, it implies a focus on controlling inflation, which is typically associated with a dovish approach. The mention of supporting a strong labor market further reinforces this dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "The Fed\u2019s credibility, earned over decades of l ow inflation, is a powerful policy tool that is critical to our long -term success.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence highlights the importance of the Fed's credibility as a policy tool for long-term success, implying a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The Fed's commitment to maintaining low inflation over the years has earned them credibility, which they consider critical for their policy effectiveness."}, {"sentence": "As a step toward that goal, I also supported the Committee\u2019s action to begin reducing the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, which is pr oviding  unneeded economic stimulus making inflation worse.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker supports reducing the Fed's balance sheet to counteract the unneeded economic stimulus, indicating a desire to tighten monetary policy and potentially curb inflation."}, {"sentence": "T he current balance sheet is composed of T reasury securities and a significant amount of agency mortgage -backed securities (MBS).", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides information about the composition of the current balance sheet, without indicating any implications or potential changes in the policy stance."}, {"sentence": "Since the longer -term goal of the balance sheet reduction plan in cludes  a Treasuries -only balance sheet, it would make sense to eventually incorporate MBS sales into the plan so that reaching this   - 5 - goal does not take too long.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The implication is that incorporating MBS sales into the balance sheet reduction plan would expedite the achievement of the longer-term goal, indicating a willingness to tighten monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "My longer -term goal would be to get the Fed out of the business of indirectly intervening in t he real estate market.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it expresses a desire to remove the Fed's indirect intervention in the real estate market. This implies a more hands-off approach, aligning with a less interventionist and more market-driven policy."}, {"sentence": "In closing, I know that inflation, and our efforts to lower it, may present challenges for banks.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses challenges for banks related to inflation and efforts to lower it, without indicating any stance or implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The first session on your agenda this morning discussed interest rate risk, and I would be interested to learn how you are managing t his risk so far and what you expect as the year progresses.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the discussion in the FOMC meeting focused on interest rate risk management. It implies a neutral stance as it seeks to understand the current approach and future expectations, without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Many of your sessions and speakers overlap with the Fed\u2019s work in supervision and much  of what I\u2019m focused on, including innovation and how best to use technology like AI and fintech to level the  playing field for banks.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the overlap between the speaker's sessions and the Fed's work in supervision, as well as their focus on innovation and technology in the banking sector. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Attracting and retaining talent, along with succession planning, are absolutely critical for long-term sustainability.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the importance of attracting and retaining talent and succession planning for long-term sustainability, which does not directly impact the monetary policy stance."}, {"sentence": "One other matter is the recently issued  Community Reinvestment Act  (CRA) proposed rule that would significantly change supervisory implementation and qualifying activities.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) proposed rule, which pertains to supervisory implementation and qualifying activities, rather than indicating a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I strongly encourage you to review this proposal and comment so that banks subject to the CRA understand the changes and will be able to continue to e ffectively serve their customers and comm unities.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it focuses on encouraging banks to review a proposal related to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and ensuring their ability to serve customers and communities effectively. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these issues, and I look forward to our discussion.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or stance on the direction of interest rates or the economy.
