Although the incoming domestic economic data have been solid, the decline in surveys of business and consumer sentiment indicates a potential concern. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if this would have a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant impact on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Given the positive outlook but also muted inflation pressures and the crosscurrents I just mentioned, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will be patient as we determine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support our dual -mandate objectives.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC acknowledges the positive economic outlook but also recognizes the presence of muted inflation pressures and crosscurrents. As a result, they will exercise patience in determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate to support their dual-mandate objectives."}, {"sentence": "This common- sense risk-management approach has served the Committee well in the past.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the Committee has followed a common-sense risk-management approach in the past, indicating a neutral stance on US monetary policy.
