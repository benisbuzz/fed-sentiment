It simply states the current state of the US economy without providing any policy implications."}, {"sentence": "Growth is meaningfully above most estimates of its long-term trend --though admittedly, that trend is not as strong as we would like it to be .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of growth being above long-term trend indicates a potential need for tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating. The acknowledgment of the trend not being as strong as desired implies a cautious approach, but still leaning towards a hawkish stance."}, {"sentence": "The labor market is particularly robust , with unemployment at its lowest level since April 2000.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish implication on US monetary policy. The robust labor market and lowest unemployment level since April 2000 indicate a strong economy, which may lead to a potential increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve to prevent overheating."}, {"sentence": "Inflation has moved up close to our 2 percent objective, although we have yet to see it remain near that objective on a sustained basis.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. While acknowledging that inflation has approached the 2 percent target, it highlights the lack of sustainability in maintaining that level. Therefore, it does not provide a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Today, most Americans who want jobs can find them.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). It focuses on the employment situation in the US rather than monetary policy, making it unrelated to the classification of hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "High demand for workers should support wage growth and labor force participation--the latter a measure on which the United States now lags most other advanced economies.1  A tight labor market may also lead businesses to invest more in technology and training, which should support productivity growth.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The high demand for workers and potential tight labor market indicate a strong economy, which may lead to wage growth and increased investment in technology and training, supporting productivity growth."}, {"sentence": "And groups such as some racial and ethnic minorities that still have higher unemployment and lower participation rates could see increasing benefits from a tight labor market.2  In short, there is a lot to like about low unemployment.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the positive aspects of a tight labor market, indicating that the FOMC sees it as beneficial, particularly for certain minority groups with higher unemployment rates."}, {"sentence": "Achieving our statutory goal of maximum em ployment in a context of price stability and financial stability is both our responsibility and our challenge.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence reflects the Federal Open Market Committee's commitment to achieving maximum employment while maintaining price and financial stability. It emphasizes the importance of balancing these goals, which is a neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Earlier in the expansion, as the economy recovered, the need for highly accommodative monetary policy was clear.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that in the earlier stages of the economic recovery, there was a clear need for a highly accommodative monetary policy. It implies a dovish stance, indicating a willingness to support the economy through loose monetary measures."}, {"sentence": "But with unemployment low and expected to decline further , inflation close to our objective , and the risks to the outlook roughly  balanced , the case for continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate is strong.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that with low unemployment, expected further decline, and inflation close to the objective, there is a strong case for continuing gradual increases in the federal funds rate."}, {"sentence": "1 See Organisation for Economi c Co-operation and D evelopment  (2018), Economic Survey  of the  United States  2018 (Paris:  OECD ), www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic -survey- united -states.htm .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it refers to the Economic Survey of the United States conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2018. It does not provide any information or implications on whether the monetary policy is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "2 These groups tend to both suffer most from labor market downturns and benefit most from improving labor markets.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the mentioned groups are highly affected by changes in the labor market. However, it does not provide any direct implications on US monetary policy. Therefore, it can be considered irrelevant to the assessment of monetary policy as it does not indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "- 2 - Current L abor M arket Conditions  At 3.8 percent, the unemployment  rate is below most estimates of its long -run level, which are now clustered in the mid- 4s.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current labor market conditions in the US are strong, with the unemployment rate at 3.8 percent, below the estimated long-run level. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it indicates a potentially hawkish stance, as it may signal a need for tighter monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy."}, {"sentence": "Many other labor market indicators also suggest an economy near full employment.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the labor market indicators, along with the statement, indicate a strong and robust economy, which could be seen as a hawkish signal."}, {"sentence": "To name just a few, these indicators include an elevated level of job vacancies.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that one of the indicators considered by the FOMC in determining US monetary policy is an elevated level of job vacancies. This indicator is relevant as it provides insight into the strength of the labor market, which can influence the committee's decision. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this information leans towards a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "For the first time since the Labor Department began collecting the data in 2000, there are now more job vacancies than there are people counted as unemployed.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a tight labor market, which could have hawkish implications on US monetary policy. The Federal Reserve might consider raising interest rates to prevent potential inflationary pressures resulting from increased competition for workers."}, {"sentence": "In addition, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs is elevated, a sign that workers  are able to find another job when they seek one.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The elevated rate of workers quitting their jobs indicates a strong labor market, implying that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more neutral or even dovish stance, as there is less urgency to stimulate the economy through hawkish measures."}, {"sentence": "And surveys show that businesses are finding it difficult to fill vacancies , and that households perceive jobs as plentiful.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the US labor market, indicating that businesses are struggling to find workers and households perceive job opportunities as abundant. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it may influence the Federal Reserve's decision-making process."}, {"sentence": "The labor force participation rate of p rime-age workers has moved up in recent years but remains below pre -crisis levels.3  In addition, wage growth has been moderate, consistent with low productivity growth but also an indication that the labor market is not excessively tight.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of the labor force participation rate increasing and wage growth being moderate indicates that the labor market is not excessively tight, which implies a balanced approach.

The expectation of a stronger job market implies potential economic growth, which may lead to a more aggressive approach in tightening monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Real gross domestic product in the United States is now reported to have risen 2- 3/4 percent over the past four quarters, well above most estimates of its long -run trend.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The strong growth in real GDP, surpassing expectations, indicates a potential need for tighter monetary measures to prevent overheating and inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Expansionary fiscal policy is expected to add to aggregate demand over the next few years.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that expansionary fiscal policy is anticipated to increase overall demand in the coming years. As it does not directly address US monetary policy, it is considered irrelevant to determining whether the policy stance is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Many forecasters expect the unemployment rate to fall into the mid -3s and to remain there for an extended period.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The expectation of a sustained low unemployment rate indicates a positive economic outlook, which may lead to a more accommodative approach by the Federal Reserve, potentially supporting a continuation of current monetary policies."}, {"sentence": "If that comes to pass, it will mean the lowest unemployment in the United States s ince the late 1960s.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or stance on the future direction of interest rates or the central bank's policy. It solely discusses the potential outcome of achieving the lowest unemployment rate since the late 1960s."}, {"sentence": "3 The labor force participation rate is defined as the number of people either with a job or who have actively looked for work within the past four weeks, a s a share of the total population.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it provides a definition of the labor force participation rate, which does not directly indicate whether the monetary policy will be hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Prime -age refers to individuals from 25 to 54 years old.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it defines the term \"prime-age\" which refers to individuals aged 25 to 54.

It does not indicate any current or future stance on monetary policy, making it unrelated to the terms hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "During that time, inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures increased from below 2 percent in 1965 to about 5 percent in 1970.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it solely provides historical information about inflation rates from 1965 to 1970. It does not indicate any current or future stance on monetary policy, making it unrelated to the terms hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "In hindsight, unemployment is now widely thought to have been unsustainably low at that time and to have contributed to escalating inflation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the previous low unemployment rate was unsustainable and contributed to rising inflation, indicating a need for a more neutral or even hawkish approach to control inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "The U.S. economy has changed in many ways over the past 50 years.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). It simply states a general observation about the changes in the US economy over a specific time period."}, {"sentence": "By some estimates, the natural rate of unemployment is substantially lower now.4  For example, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that the natural rate was about 5 -3/4 percent (and rising) in the late 1960s, compared with  4-3/4 percent at present.5   Rising education levels do point to a decline in the natural rate since the 1960s, because more highly educated people are less likely to be unemployed.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the natural rate of unemployment has decreased over time due to rising education levels. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it indicates a potential decrease in unemployment, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decision-making process. However, it does not explicitly lean towards a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "The share of the population with a college degree has risen from less than 15 percent in the late 1960s to nearly 40 percent now, and the share with less than a high school degree has declined                                                  4 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate over the longer term that is consistent with low and stable inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the rise in the share of the population with a college degree and the decline in the share with less than a high school degree.

It implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy, as it indicates a willingness to maintain accommodative measures to support the labor market without immediate concerns about inflation."}, {"sentence": "Natural rate estimates have always been uncertain, and may be even more so now as inflation has becom e less responsive to the unemployment rate .7  The anchoring of expectations is a welcome development and                                                  6 Other changes in the workforce since the late 1960s seem less likely to have much affected the natural rate of unemployment .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the uncertainty surrounding natural rate estimates remains, and the recent decrease in inflation's responsiveness to unemployment adds to this uncertainty. The anchoring of expectations is seen as positive, indicating a dovish stance on US monetary policy.

The mention of a flat Phillips curve implies that the impact on inflation may not be significant. However, the possibility of larger, nonlinear effects due to a tight labor market indicates a potential for hawkish measures if necessary."}, {"sentence": "Research on this question is ambiguous, again reflecting the limited historical experience.8  We should also remember that where inflation expectatio ns are well anchored, it is likely because central banks have kept inflation under control.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the ambiguity in research and limited historical experience, indicating that the implications are uncertain. It also highlights the importance of central banks in keeping inflation expectations well anchored, which is relevant for monetary policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "If central banks were instead to try to exploit the nonresponsiveness of inflation to low unemployment and push resource utilization significantly and persistently  past sustainable levels, the public might begin to question our commitment to low inflation, and expectations could come under upward pressure.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It highlights the importance of not pushing resource utilization significantly past sustainable levels, as it may lead to questioning the commitment to low inflation and create upward pressure on expectations."}, {"sentence": "If anything, some measures of longer -term inflation expectations in the U nited States have edged lower in recent years.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that longer-term inflation expectations in the United States have slightly decreased over the past few years. This could be seen as a dovish signal for US monetary policy, as it indicates a potential lack of inflationary pressures and may support a more accommodative stance."}, {"sentence": "Third, can persistently strong economic conditions pose financial stability risks?", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is concerned about the potential financial stability risks that may arise from persistently strong economic conditions.
