The speaker believes that substantial progress has been made towards employment and inflation mandates, indicating a potential decision to reduce purchases and complete the process by the middle of next year."}, {"sentence": "Bear in mind that asset purchases are pressing down on the accelerator, adding each month to the amount of accommodation the Fed is providing to the economy through downward pressure on longer -term interest rates.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It highlights that the Fed's asset purchases are actively stimulating the economy by increasing accommodation and lowering long-term interest rates."}, {"sentence": "Reducing purchases and ending them on thi s schedule is not monetary tightening, but a gradual reduction in the pace at which we are adding accommodation.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy.
