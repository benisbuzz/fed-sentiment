The mention of inflation escalating substantially and a significant rise in inflation expectations indicates a potential need for tighter monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "The October c onsumer price index  report showed a n unexpected surge in inflation .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish implication on US monetary policy. The unexpected surge in inflation, as indicated by the October consumer price index report, may prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more cautious approach and potentially tighten monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "The monthly print corresponds to an annualized rate exceeding 10  percent , while the year -over-year increase was 6.2  percent \u2014the highest since December 1990.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

The broadening of price pressures across various categories, including energy, food, goods, services, and housing, indicates an increase in inflationary pressures. This may prompt the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary policy to curb inflation."}, {"sentence": "Even trimmed mean measures of inflation  that exclude some big price  increases, such as the Cleveland Fed and the Dallas Fed measures, report inflation rates above the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that even when excluding certain significant price increases, inflation rates, as indicated by trimmed mean measures like the Cleveland Fed and the Dallas Fed measures, remain above the Fed's 2 percent target.

It acknowledges the presence of supply constraints that are potentially improving, while also highlighting strong and persistent demand. However, it does not provide a clear indication of whether the stance will be hawkish, dovish, or remain neutral."}, {"sentence": "Wages continue to grow quickly on a more sustained basis than they have in more than 20 years, most recently reflected in a striking increase in the e mployment c ost index, which considers both pay and benefits.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The sustained growth of wages, reflected in the employment cost index, indicates a potential increase in inflationary pressures. This could prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more aggressive approach, such as raising interest rates, to maintain price stability."}, {"sentence": "Wages and em ployment costs seem to be widespread across industries and among businesses of different size s.  Crucial to the path of inflation will be whether we see input cost increases consistently reflected in final goods prices.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is closely monitoring wages and employment costs, as they are widespread across industries and businesses. The crucial factor for inflation will be if input cost increases are consistently reflected in final goods prices. This information is relevant to US monetary policy as it provides insight into potential inflationary pressures, making it a neutral statement."}, {"sentence": "Our business contacts report that c ompanies are comfortable passing along these cost increases to their customers.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that companies are able to pass on cost increases to customers without difficulty. This implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it indicates that inflationary pressures are being absorbed by businesses and not necessarily requiring a hawkish or dovish response from the Federal Reserve."}, {"sentence": "It has been  argued that because price pressures connected to supply constraints are transitory, they will come to an end , so monetary policy does not need to respond to tempora ry price pressures.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It argues that temporary price pressures caused by supply constraints are transitory and therefore monetary policy does not need to respond to them."}, {"sentence": "Second, the macroeconomic models we use to guide policy typically have cost shocks built in that cause inflation to move.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the macroeconomic models used by the FOMC incorporate cost shocks that impact inflation. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it implies that the FOMC considers these models when making policy decisions. However, it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "In those models, appropriate monetary policy responds to these inflation movements ; it doesn\u2019t ignore them, even though they are transitory.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the appropriate monetary policy takes into account inflation movements, even if they are temporary. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it emphasizes the importance of addressing inflation fluctuations rather than disregarding them."}, {"sentence": "Fin ally, the choice to take a policy action depends  on how large the shocks are and how long they are expected to persist.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the decision to take a policy action is based on the magnitude and duration of the shocks, rather than leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "To me, the inflation data are starting to look a lot more like a big snowfall that will stay on the ground for a while , and that development is affect ing my expectations of the level of monetary accommodation that is needed going forward.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The comparison of inflation data to a snowfall that will persist implies that the speaker believes inflation will remain low for an extended period. This influences their expectations of the necessary level of monetary accommodation, indicating a preference for maintaining or increasing accommodative measures."}, {"sentence": "Inflation expectations on the part of the public also play a role in the conduct of monetary policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that inflation expectations of the public are considered in the implementation of monetary policy. It implies a neutral stance as it acknowledges the importance of inflation expectations without explicitly indicating a hawkish or dovish bias."}, {"sentence": "Two surveys of consumers \u2014by the University of Michigan and the New York Fed \u2014show medium inflation expectations running over 4 percent, and bond investors are  requiring over 3 percent compensation for future inflation and inflation risks.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that inflation expectations are running high, as indicated by the surveys conducted by the University of Michigan and the New York Fed. Bond investors are also demanding compensation for future inflation and inflation risks. These factors could be seen as hawkish, indicating a potential need for tighter monetary policy to control inflation."}, {"sentence": "It is very concerning to me that households  and markets are no longer expecting us to keep inflation near our 2 percent target over the next three to five years.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The concern expressed about households and markets no longer expecting inflation to be kept near the 2 percent target implies a desire to maintain accommodative measures to stimulate economic growth and ensure price stability."}, {"sentence": "Now, it i s true that there is some evidence that these consumer survey measures of future inflation tend to move around a lot based on changes in current inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that consumer survey measures of future inflation are influenced by changes in current inflation. However, it does not provide a clear indication of the stance on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "So I hope these large movements in inflation expectations are \u2014wait for it\u2014 transitory and will come back down as bottlenecks and labor shortages resolve themselves over the coming months.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the current inflation expectations as transitory and expects them to decrease as bottlenecks and labor shortages are resolved. It does not indicate a hawkish or dovish approach, making it irrelevant to US monetary policy decisions."}, {"sentence": "But i f these measures were to continue moving upward, I would become concerned that expectations would lead households to demand higher wages to compensate for expecte d inflation , which could raise inflation in the near term and keep it elevated for some time.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The concern about expectations leading to higher wages and inflation indicates a potential need for tighter monetary policy to prevent inflation from remaining elevated for an extended period."}, {"sentence": "This possibility is a risk to the inflation outlook that I\u2019m watching carefully.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a cautious stance towards inflation, indicating a hawkish tone. The speaker is closely monitoring the risk posed by this possibility, implying a potential need for tighter monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "So, what are the implications of all these considerations for monetary policy?", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker is seeking to understand the implications of the considerations discussed for monetary policy. It is a neutral statement as it does not provide any specific indication of whether the implications are hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "The economy made faster progress in 2021 tha n most of us expected back in December 2020.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish tone as it indicates that the economy has exceeded expectations, implying potential for a more aggressive approach to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "This substantial progress toward our dual mandate goals allowed us to begin reduc ing the $120 billion a month in asset purchases that are aidin g the recovery by steadily providing  - 6 - accommodation to financial conditions .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The substantial progress towards the dual mandate goals has led to the decision of reducing the asset purchases, which were aiding the recovery. This reduction implies a less accommodative approach to financial conditions."}, {"sentence": "When we started tapering a few days ago, it happened several months earlier than was expected by market participants  in the early months of 2021.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates an earlier-than-expected tapering of stimulus measures. The fact that it occurred earlier than anticipated by market participants implies a potentially more aggressive approach, signaling a tightening of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We cut both t he amount of Treasury securities purchases to $70 billion per month from $80 billion per month, and the amount of agency mortgage -backed securities (MBS) to $35 billion from $40 billion.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it reveals a reduction in the amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities purchases. This reduction suggests a tightening of monetary policy, which is generally associated with a hawkish approach."}, {"sentence": "We will make another $10 billion and $5 billion cut to the monthly purchases in mid -December .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates a reduction in monthly purchases, signaling a tightening of monetary stimulus. This move reflects a more cautious approach towards economic recovery and a potential shift towards normalization."}, {"sentence": "The next few months will be critical , however, in determining how the tapering process plays out.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the upcoming months will have a significant impact on the outcome of the tapering process. It implies a neutral stance as it does not explicitly indicate whether the outcome will be hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The Committee has been very clear, in the months leading up to our decision, and in making that decision, that the pace of reducing asset purchases would depend on progress toward our dual mandate goals.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the Committee's decision on reducing asset purchases is dependent on the progress made towards achieving the dual mandate goals. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the importance of meeting the goals rather than leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "If COVID or some other factor substantially slows the recovery, hindering the progress toward maximum employment, the FOMC could slow the taper.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that if the recovery is significantly hindered by factors like COVID, the FOMC may slow down the tapering of monetary stimulus measures to support the progress towards maximum employment."}, {"sentence": "But if the economy makes quick progress toward maximum employment  or inflation data show no signs of retreating from their currently high readings, the Committee may ch oose to  speed up the taper, which would position it to accelerate subsequent steps in tightening monetary policy if necessary.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. If the economy continues to improve rapidly or inflation remains high, the Committee may choose to speed up the tapering of asset purchases, indicating a potential acceleration in tightening monetary policy if needed."}, {"sentence": "The timing of any policy action is a decision for the FOMC, but for my part  the rapid improvement in the labor market and the deteriorating inflation data ha ve pushed me towards favoring a faster pace of tapering and a more rapid removal of accommodation in  2022.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges the FOMC's role in deciding policy actions but expresses a preference for a faster pace of tapering and removal of accommodation due to the rapid improvement in the labor market and deteriorating inflation data."}, {"sentence": "Another policy action already being discussed in public by market participants is the timing of the first increase, or liftoff, of the target range for the federal funds rate.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate is being actively discussed by market participants. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it indicates a hawkish sentiment, as market participants are considering the possibility of a rate hike."}, {"sentence": "The FOMC has described the conditions that must be met to consider liftoff.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the FOMC is discussing the conditions necessary for liftoff, which refers to the start of increasing interest rates. As it does not provide any specific stance or indication of the FOMC's preference, it can be considered neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "They are when the economy has reached maximum employment, and when inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will consider tightening monetary policy by raising interest rates when the economy achieves maximum employment and inflation exceeds 2 percent for a sustained period."}, {"sentence": "Assuming  - 7 - inflation expectations are well- anchored, I judge that the timing of liftoff is any time after  both of these conditions have been met.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the timing of liftoff (raising interest rates) can occur once inflation expectations are stable and two specific conditions are fulfilled.
