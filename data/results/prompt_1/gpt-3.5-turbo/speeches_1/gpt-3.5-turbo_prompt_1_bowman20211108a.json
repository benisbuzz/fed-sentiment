While acknowledging the potential negative impact of falling home prices, it also highlights the concern of continued outsized increases. This balanced view indicates a cautious approach, neither hawkish nor dovish, but rather focused on potential risks."}, {"sentence": "First, high home prices  make it more difficult for low- to moderate -income households to become  homeowner s, as larger down payments and other financing requirements effectively lock these households out of the housing market .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The high home prices create difficulties for low- to moderate-income households to become homeowners, indicating a need for policies that promote affordable housing and potentially lower interest rates to address this issue."}, {"sentence": "Second , and related to one of the Federal Reserve\u2019s  monetary policy goals,  rising  home prices  and rents raise the cost of housing.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence is neutral as it simply states a fact about rising home prices and rents increasing the cost of housing.

As housing costs are a significant portion of living expenses, this implies a potential upward pressure on prices.

However, it does not directly address US monetary policy, making it irrelevant to the assessment of whether it is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "Before this past year, the pace of construction of new homes w as below its long- run average for more than a decade.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the pace of construction of new homes, which does not directly impact the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding interest rates or other monetary policy tools."}, {"sentence": "The supply chain bottlenecks that I mentioned earlier are slowing down construction further.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses supply chain bottlenecks and their impact on construction.
