It implies a dovish sentiment, indicating a potential inclination towards looser monetary policy to stimulate the economy."}, {"sentence": "We are carefully monitoring these developments  and assessing  their implications for the U.S economic outlook and inflation, and will act as  - 4 - appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2  percent objective .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.

However, it does not provide any direct indication of the stance on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Such changes in the macroeconomic environment  are significant because the long- run normal  levels of inflation, output, interest rates , and the unemployment rate are important structural features by which we guide policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the macroeconomic environment plays a crucial role in guiding US monetary policy, as it considers long-run normal levels of inflation, output, interest rates, and unemployment rate.

It implies that if the neutral rate of interest remains low and the risk of hitting the lower bound remains high, policymakers will continue to operate cautiously, prioritizing measures to avoid a crisis similar to the previous one."}, {"sentence": "This p roximity to the lower bound poses new complications for  central banks and calls for new ideas.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the proximity to the lower bound of interest rates presents challenges for central banks, indicating a need for new ideas.
