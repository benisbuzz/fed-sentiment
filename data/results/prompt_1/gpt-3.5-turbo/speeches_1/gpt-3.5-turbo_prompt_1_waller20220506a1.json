It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "First, the Fed was not alone in underestimating the strength of inflation that revealed itself in late 2021.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the Fed, along with others, underestimated the strength of inflation in late 2021. It implies a dovish stance as it acknowledges a potential oversight in assessing inflation, which may lead to a cautious approach in US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Second, to determine whether the Fed was behind the curve, one must take a pos ition on the evolving health of the labor market during 2021.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that assessing the evolving health of the labor market in 2021 is crucial to determine if the Fed was behind the curve. It implies a neutral stance as it does not explicitly lean towards a hawkish or dovish monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Finally, setting policy in real time can create what appear to be policy errors after the fact due to data revisions.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC acknowledges the possibility of policy errors caused by data revisions when making real-time policy decisions. It is neutral as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish stance, but highlights the challenges faced by the committee in formulating monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Let me start by remind ing everyone of two immutable facts about setting monetary policy in the United States.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any specific information or implications regarding the stance of the policy. It simply serves as an introductory statement without indicating whether it is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "First, we have a dual mandate from the Congress: maximum employment and price stability.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to the implications of US monetary policy as it simply states the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, which is already known. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Whether you believe this is the appropriate mandate or not, it is the law of the land , and it is our job to pursue both objectives .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the mandate and the responsibility of pursuing objectives, without providing any indication of a specific stance or direction."}, {"sentence": "Second, policy is set by a large committee of up to 12 voting members and a total of 19 participa nts in our discussions.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it solely describes the structure of the committee responsible for setting policy.

It highlights the importance of diverse opinions and interpretations of economic data, indicating a balanced approach rather than a hawkish or dovish bias."}, {"sentence": "We need to reconcile those views and reach a consensus that we believe will move the economy toward our mandate.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC is focused on reaching a consensus to move the economy towards their mandate. It does not provide a clear indication of whether the stance on US monetary policy is hawkish, dovish, or neutral. Therefore, the sentence is irrelevant to determining the implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "This process may lead to more gradual changes in policy as members have to compromise in order to reach a consensus.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the decision-making process within the FOMC may result in more gradual changes, indicating a willingness to compromise among members to reach a consensus."}, {"sentence": "Back in September and December 2020, respectively,  the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC)  laid out guidance for raising the federal funds rate off the zero lower bound and for tapering asset purchases.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the FOMC has provided guidance on raising the federal funds rate and tapering asset purchases in September and December 2020. It suggests a hawkish stance as it implies a potential tightening of US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We said that we would \u201caim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time\u201d to ensure that it averages 2 percent over time   - 2 - and that inflation expectations stay anchored.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC aims to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time, indicating a willingness to tolerate higher inflation levels. The focus on anchoring inflation expectations further supports a dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "We also said that the Fed would keep buying $120 billion per  month in securities until \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d was made toward our dual -mandate objectives.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of continuing to buy securities until \"substantial further progress\" is made towards the dual-mandate objectives implies a cautious approach, neither hawkish nor dovish, as the Fed maintains its current level of support."}, {"sentence": "It is important to stress that views varied among FOMC participants on what was \u201csom e time\u201d and \u201csubstantial further progress.\u201d  The metrics for achieving these outcomes also varied across participants.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that there is a divergence of opinions among FOMC participants regarding the interpretation of \"som e time\" and \"substantial further progress.\" This indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it highlights the lack of consensus on key metrics and timeframes, making it difficult to determine a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant approach."}, {"sentence": "A few months later, in March 2021, I made my first submission for the Summary of Economic Projections as an FOMC member.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides historical information about the author's involvement in the FOMC.

The projection of inflation above 2 percent for 2021 and 2022 indicates a concern for potential overheating in the economy, which may lead to a more aggressive approach in tightening monetary policy.

The speaker believes that in order to lift off from the zero lower bound (ZLB) in the second half of 2022, tapering of asset purchases should begin in the second half of 2021 and end by the third quarter of 2022. This indicates a willingness to reduce stimulus measures and potentially tighten monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "This projection was based on my judgment that the economy would heal much faster than many expected.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The projection is based on the belief that the economy will recover faster than anticipated, indicating a potential inclination towards tightening monetary measures to prevent overheating and inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "This was not 2009, and expectations of a slow, grinding recovery were inaccurate, in my view.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish view on US monetary policy. It implies that the expectations of a slow, grinding recovery in 2009 were inaccurate, indicating a more positive outlook. This could imply a potential shift towards a less accommodative monetary policy stance."}, {"sentence": "In April 2021, I said the economy was \u201cready to rip,\u201d and it did.1  I chose to look at the unemployment rate and job cr eation  as the labor market indicators I would use to assess whether we had made \u201csubstantial further progress.\u201d  My projection was also based on the belief that the jump in inflation that occurred in March 2021 would be more persistent than many expected.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker's assessment of the economy as \"ready to rip\" and their focus on the unemployment rate and job creation as indicators of progress indicate a more aggressive approach towards tightening monetary policy. Additionally, their expectation of persistent inflation implies a willingness to take preemptive measures to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "1 See Jeff Cox (2021), \u201c Fed\u2019s Waller Says the Economy Is \u2018Ready to Rip\u2019 But Policy Should Stay Put,\u201d CNBC,  April 16.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence, which mentions that the economy is 'ready to rip' but policy should stay put, suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that despite the positive outlook for the economy, the Federal Reserve should maintain its current accommodative stance rather than adopting a more hawkish approach."}, {"sentence": "Eleven of my colleagues did not have a rate hike penciled in until after 2023.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates that a majority of the colleagues in the FOMC did not anticipate a rate hike until after 2023. This implies a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "With regard to future inflation, 13 participants projected inflation in 2022 would be at or below our 2 percent target.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates that a significant number of participants expect inflation to remain below the 2 percent target in 2022. This implies a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "In the M arch 2021 SEP, no C ommittee member expected inflation to be over 3  percent for 2021.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence indicates a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The fact that no Committee member expected inflation to exceed 3 percent for 2021 suggests a cautious approach, prioritizing price stability."}, {"sentence": "As I argued in a speech last December, this view was consistent with private -sector economic forecasts.2   When inflation broke loose in March 2021, even though I had expected it to run above 2 percent in 2021 and 2022, I never thought it would reach the very high levels we have seen in recent months.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication of the stance or direction of the policy. It discusses the speaker's personal expectations and observations on inflation, but does not offer any insight into whether the policy will be hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "All the suspected drivers of this surge in inflation appeared to be temporary : the one -time stimulus from fiscal policy, supply chain shocks that previous experience indicated would ease soon, and a surge in demand  for goods .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that the surge in inflation is driven by temporary factors such as fiscal policy stimulus, supply chain shocks, and increased demand for goods. Therefore, it indicates that the Federal Reserve may not view this inflationary pressure as a long-term concern, making it irrelevant for immediate policy adjustments."}, {"sentence": "In addition, we had very accommodative monetary policy that I believe d would end in 2022.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it mentions a very accommodative monetary policy that is expected to end in 2022. This implies a willingness to maintain supportive measures, indicating a cautious approach towards tightening policy."}, {"sentence": "Over the summer of 2021, the labor market and other data related to economic activity came in as I expected, and so I argued publicly that we were rapidly approaching \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d on the employment leg of our mandate.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges that the labor market and economic data aligned with their expectations, indicating progress towards the employment goal. The mention of \"substantial further progress\" implies a potential inclination towards tightening monetary policy in the near future."}, {"sentence": "In the June Summary of Economic Projections , seven participants had liftoff in 2022 and only five  participants projected liftoff after 2023.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates that a majority of participants in the FOMC project an earlier liftoff in 2022, implying a more aggressive approach towards tightening monetary conditions."}, {"sentence": "Also, unlike the March SEP, every C ommittee participant now expected inflation to be over 3 percent in 2021 and just five believed inflation would be at 2 percent or below in 2022.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The fact that every Committee participant expects inflation to be over 3 percent in 2021 indicates a concern about rising inflationary pressures. Additionally, the belief that only five participants anticipate inflation at 2 percent or below in 2022 further reinforces the hawkish sentiment."}, {"sentence": "In addition, the vast majority  of  2 See Christopher J.

It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "- 4 - participants  now saw risk s associated with inflation weighted to the upside .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates that a significant number of participants perceive inflation risks to be tilted towards the upside. This implies a potential need for tighter monetary measures to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "The June 2021 m inutes also describe the vigorous discussion about tapering asset purchases.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the discussion about tapering asset purchases was intense during the June 2021 FOMC meeting. It implies a hawkish stance, indicating a potential inclination towards reducing the current monetary stimulus measures."}, {"sentence": "Numerous participants said that new data indicated that tapering should begin sooner than anticipated.3  Thus, in June,  after observing high inflation for only three months, the Committee was moving in a hawkish direction and was considering tapering sooner and pulling liftoff forward.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC participants believe that tapering should start earlier than expected due to new data. It indicates a hawkish stance as the Committee considers tapering sooner and potentially accelerating liftoff, reflecting a more aggressive approach towards US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "At the July FOMC meeting, the minutes show that most participants believed that \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d had been made on inflation but not employment.4  Tapering was not viewed as imminent by most participants.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC participants acknowledge progress in inflation but not employment, indicating a cautious approach. The view that tapering is not imminent aligns with a neutral stance, as they are not rushing to reduce stimulus."}, {"sentence": "Again, individual participants had different metrics for evaluating the health of the labor market, and this approach influenced how each thought about policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the evaluation of the labor market varies among individual participants, which implies a divergence in their policy perspectives. It highlights a neutral stance as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish bias towards US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "So, in my view, one cannot address the question of \u201c how did the Fed get so far behind the curve?\u201d without taking a stand on the health of the labor market as we moved through 2021.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the health of the labor market is crucial in understanding why the Fed fell behind in terms of monetary policy. It implies a neutral stance as it emphasizes the importance of considering the labor market's condition without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Based on the incoming data over the summer, my position was that we would soon achieve the substantial further  progress needed to start tapering of asset purchases\u2014in particular,  our purchases of agency mortgage -backed securities\u2014 and that we needed to \u201cgo early and go fast\u201d on tapering our asset purchases to position ourselves for rate hikes in 2022 should we need to tighten policy .5  I also argued that , if the July and August job reports came in around the forecast values of 800,000 to 1 million job gains per month, we should commence tapering our asset purchases at the September 2021 FOMC  3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), \u201c Minutes of the Federal Open Market Com mittee, June 15 \u201316, 2021,\u201d press release, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210707a.htm .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy.

It does not provide any information or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or its monetary policy, making it unrelated to the terms 'hawkish', 'dovish', 'neutral', or their implications."}, {"sentence": "I considered this a punch in the gut and relevant to a decision on when to start tapering.6  Neve rtheless, the September FOMC statement noted that the economy had made progress toward the C ommittee\u2019s goals and that , if progress continued , it would soon be time to taper.7 Up until October, monthly core personal c onsumption e xpenditure s (PCE)  inflation was actually slowing.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker views the progress made towards the Committee's goals as relevant to the decision on when to start tapering. However, it also mentions that inflation was slowing until October. Overall, this sentence is neutral in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "As shown in Figure 1, i t went from 0.62  percent  in April to 0.24 percent  for the month of September.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it only provides statistical information without any indication of the FOMC's stance. It does not provide any implications on whether the policy is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "The September jobs report was another shock, with only 194,000 jobs created.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the September jobs report was disappointing, as only 194,000 jobs were created. It implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy, as the low job creation may indicate a need for further stimulus measures to support economic growth."}, {"sentence": "So, up until the first week of October 2021, the story  of high inflation being temporary was holding up, and the labor market improvements had slowed but were continuing.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges that the narrative of high inflation being temporary was still valid until October 2021, and although labor market improvements had slowed, they were still ongoing."}, {"sentence": "Based on the incoming data, the FOMC announced the start of tapering at its early November meeting.8 It was the October and N ovember consumer price index ( CPI) reports that showed that the deceleration of inflation from April to September was short lived and year -over-year inflation had topped 6 percent.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The FOMC's decision to start tapering suggests a tightening of monetary policy. The mention of the consumer price index reports and the high year-over-year inflation rate of over 6 percent further supports this hawkish stance."}, {"sentence": "It became clear that the high inflation  realizations were not as temporary  as originally thought .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The realization that high inflation is not as temporary implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may be more inclined to maintain accommodative measures rather than adopting a hawkish approach."}, {"sentence": "And the October jobs report showed a significant rebound with 531,000 jobs created and  big upward revisions to the previous two months.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a positive outlook on the US economy, indicating a hawkish stance on monetary policy. The strong job creation and upward revisions imply potential economic growth, which may lead to a more aggressive approach in tightening monetary measures."}, {"sentence": "6 Of course, as we all know, th ese employment data would be revised upward substantially, but that was not known to policymakers at the time , and it\u2019s important to explicitly make that point now \u2014the data were choppy and did not lend themselves to a clear picture of the outlook.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the revision of employment data and the lack of clarity in the outlook.

This alignment indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy, as it reflects a consensus between the market and the Committee."}, {"sentence": "Given this description of how policy evolved over 2021, did the Fed fall far behind the curve?", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy.

It indicates that some members of the FOMC believed the labor market was improving rapidly and advocated for a quicker and earlier reduction in accommodation measures, implying a potential tightening of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "For others, data suggested the labor market was not  - 7 - healing that fast and it was n ot optimal to withdraw policy accommodation soon.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that some individuals believe the labor market is not recovering quickly and it is not advisable to withdraw policy accommodation in the near future."}, {"sentence": "Many of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the employment leg of our mandate.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the critics of the FOMC's monetary policy tend to overlook the importance of the employment aspect of their mandate, focusing solely on inflation. It implies a neutral stance as it highlights the need to consider both aspects of the mandate, without explicitly favoring a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "So, what may appear as a policy error to some was  viewed as appr opriate  policy by others based on their views regarding the health of the labor market.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the perception of a policy error varies among individuals based on their views on the labor market's health. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it acknowledges differing opinions without explicitly favoring a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Third, one must account for setting policy in real time.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence implies that considering the real-time context is crucial when setting US monetary policy. It is neutral as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish stance, but emphasizes the importance of timely decision-making."}, {"sentence": "The Committee was getting mixed signals from the labor market data in August and September.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the labor market data in August and September provided conflicting indications to the Committee.

The growing consensus that the labor market is stronger than initially believed indicates a potential need for tighter monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "If we knew then what we know now, I believe the Committee would have accelerated tapering and raised rates sooner.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that, with the benefit of hindsight, the speaker believes the Committee should have acted more aggressively by accelerating tapering (reducing asset purchases) and raising interest rates earlier."}, {"sentence": "But no one knew, and that\u2019s the nature of making monetary policy in real time.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence implies that the uncertainty surrounding the nature of making monetary policy in real time makes it difficult to determine whether the policy stance is hawkish, dovish, or neutral.
