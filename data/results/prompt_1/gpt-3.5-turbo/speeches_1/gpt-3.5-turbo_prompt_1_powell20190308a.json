Therefore, this change can be seen as a move towards a more neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Until now, forward guidance in the statement has been a main tool for communicating committee intentions and minimizing that confusion.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the use of forward guidance as a tool for communicating committee intentions has been effective in reducing confusion.
