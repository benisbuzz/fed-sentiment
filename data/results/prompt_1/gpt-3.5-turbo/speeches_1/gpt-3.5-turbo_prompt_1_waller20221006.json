The mention of strong demand and substantial increases in prices for shelter suggests a potential inflationary pressure. Therefore, the implications of this sentence on US monetary policy can be considered as potentially hawkish."}, {"sentence": "Because t he housing market is sensitive to changes in interest rates and thus to monetary policy, I\u2019ll conclude by discuss ing how housing is being affected by the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) efforts to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the FOMC recognizes the impact of monetary policy on the housing market. It suggests a neutral stance as the FOMC is discussing the effects of its efforts to achieve its dual mandate, rather than explicitly stating a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Recent data on economic activity suggest that after a slight contraction in gross domestic product  in the first half of this year, the economy is posed for modest but below -trend growth in the latter ha lf.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of a slight contraction in GDP and below-trend growth indicates a need for accommodative measures to stimulate the economy."}, {"sentence": "Meanwhile, the labor market remains strong and very tight .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the labor market in the US is currently strong and tight. As a result, it implies a hawkish stance on US monetary policy, indicating a potential inclination towards tightening measures to prevent inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Employers added 315,000 jobs in August, well above the rate needed to keep up with population growth.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a strong job growth in August, which could be seen as a hawkish signal for US monetary policy. The robust employment numbers suggest a potential need for the Federal Reserve to adopt a more neutral or even dovish stance to prevent overheating the economy."}, {"sentence": "While the unemployment rate rose, that was largely due to nearly  800,000 people who joined the civilian labor force, many of them drawn in by ample job openings and fast wage growth.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The rise in the unemployment rate is seen as irrelevant because it is attributed to an increase in the civilian labor force, which is driven by ample job openings and fast wage growth."}, {"sentence": "At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate was below the median projection for its long run rate among FOMC participants.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy. The unemployment rate being below the median projection indicates a stronger labor market, potentially leading to a more accommodative stance by the FOMC in terms of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Furthermore, initial unemployment claims a re very low and stable.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the current state of initial unemployment claims being very low and stable could be seen as a positive indicator for the US economy.

The increase in core PCE inflation suggests a potential upward pressure on prices, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more restrictive monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Furthermore, core PCE inflation is not only high,  but very persistent , with monthly prints of core PCE inflation at an annualized rate averag ing about 5 percent  this year .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of high and persistent core PCE inflation, averaging about 5 percent annually, indicates a concern for rising prices.

However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this statement leans towards a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "We currently do not face a tradeoff between our employment objective and our inflation objective, so  monetary policy can and must be used aggressively to bring down inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. It implies that there is no tradeoff between employment and inflation objectives, allowing for aggressive use of monetary policy to combat inflation."}, {"sentence": "Let me turn to the troubling persistence of inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the speaker is concerned about the ongoing presence of inflation. If the FOMC considers this issue as a potential threat to the economy, it could imply a hawkish stance, indicating a likelihood of tightening monetary policy to combat inflation."}, {"sentence": "In the p ast couple of inflation reports, housing services has been a major contributor to measured inflation.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that housing services have played a significant role in the inflation reports. However, it does not provide any direct implications on US monetary policy. Therefore, it is irrelevant to determining whether the sentence is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant."}, {"sentence": "In the lates t inflation  report s, shelter prices rose 0.7  percent on a monthly basis.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates a rise in shelter prices in the latest inflation report. As shelter prices are a component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), this information is relevant to US monetary policy. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this development is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "Housing has a large weight in price indexes, as households spend a sizable amount of their incomes on housing services .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence implies that the importance of housing in price indexes is significant due to households allocating a substantial portion of their incomes towards housing services. However, it does not provide any direct indication of the stance on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether it is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "The combination of high monthly inflation and a large weight in measuring overall prices means that shelter inflation is a key driver of overall inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that shelter inflation plays a significant role in driving overall inflation due to its high monthly inflation and substantial weight in measuring overall prices. This information is relevant for US monetary policy as it may influence the Federal Reserve's decision-making process regarding interest rates and inflation targets."}, {"sentence": "Moreover, shelter inflation is a particularly persistent component of inflation and why I am focuse d on closely watching shelter inflation in determining my outlook for U.S. inflation.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the speaker is closely monitoring shelter inflation as a key factor in determining their outlook for U.S. inflation. It implies a hawkish stance as the focus on shelter inflation suggests a concern about rising prices and may influence a more cautious approach to monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Unfortunately, the message is th at shelter inflation will likely remain high for several months , meaning overall core PCE inflation will continue to be persistently high.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of \"shelter inflation\" remaining high for several months implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) acknowledges the persistence of inflationary pressures. This indicates a likelihood of maintaining accommodative measures to support the economy, making it relevant to the current monetary policy discussions."}, {"sentence": "There  has been a considerable imbalance in the supply and demand for housing for some time .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). It solely discusses the supply and demand imbalance in the housing market without addressing monetary policy measures."}, {"sentence": "Housing is also sensitive to interest rates and thus quite responsive to monetary policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that housing is influenced by changes in interest rates, indicating a potential impact on US monetary policy. It implies a neutral stance as it acknowledges the sensitivity of housing to interest rates without explicitly leaning towards a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "S o for the next few minutes, I would like to focus on how demand\u2013supply imbalance in both owner -occupied and rental markets came about, how it is affecting prices fo r housing today and in future, and how  housing is likely to affect  the FOMC\u2019s efforts to return inflation to our 2 percent goal.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the demand-supply imbalance in housing markets and its impact on prices, without directly addressing the stance of the FOMC towards monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Housing demand increased strongly in the years leading up to the pandemic , sustained by relatively low interest rates , the form ation of new households , and rising  - 4 - incomes .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the strong increase in housing demand before the pandemic was supported by factors such as low interest rates, the formation of new households, and rising incomes. However, it does not provide any direct implications on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in determining whether the policy stance is hawkish, dovish, neutral, or otherwise."}, {"sentence": "Demand for housing then surged during the pandemic as people spent  more time at home , initially  on the intensive margin \u2014more housing square footage per household.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the surge in demand for housing during the pandemic, specifically focusing on the increase in housing square footage per household. It does not provide any indication of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Couples in apartments wanted more space to work from home and opted for bigger apartments or houses.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the housing preferences of couples in apartments.

This indicates a hawkish stance as the Fed's actions are aimed at reducing the availability of credit and controlling inflation."}, {"sentence": "Higher borrowing costs have made it more expensive for households to buy homes, whether they are first- time buyers or trading their current home for a different one.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that higher borrowing costs have impacted the affordability of homes for both first-time buyers and those looking to trade their current home. It implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it highlights the potential negative effects of higher borrowing costs on the housing market and consumer spending."}, {"sentence": "The monthly numbers of new and existing home sales are now back below the average levels seen in  - 5 - the few years before  the pandemic.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it solely provides information about the monthly numbers of new and existing home sales, without indicating any implications or preferences towards a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "So far, the contraction in housing demand has been more pronounced than the changes in supply, an d so inventories of homes for sale have increased.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy.
