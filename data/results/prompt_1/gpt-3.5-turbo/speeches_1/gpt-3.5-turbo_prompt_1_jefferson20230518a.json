Despite the mentioned uncertainties and stress in the banking sector, geopolitical instability, and the aftermath of the pandemic, the expectation of economic growth in the second quarter indicates a cautious optimism, neither hawkish nor dovish."}, {"sentence": "The pace of growth, however, will be slower than what we observed in the first  quarter , when real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1.1 percent.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates that the pace of growth is expected to slow down compared to the previous quarter. This implies that the Federal Open Market Committee may consider maintaining or even lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity."}, {"sentence": "My expectation is based mainly on data that showed weakening spending in recent months , and other data that imply  moderating spending, including a sizable decline in April in consumer sentiment , as measured by the initial estimate of the University of Michigan Survey s of Consumers.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of weakening spending and moderating spending, along with the decline in consumer sentiment, indicates a cautious approach towards monetary tightening."}, {"sentence": "While my base case forecast for the U.S. economy is not a recession, I expect spending and GDP growth to remain quite slow over the rest of 2023, due to  continued tight  financial conditions, low consumer sentiment, and a decline in househol d savings that had built up after the onset of the pandemic.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The expectation of slow spending and GDP growth, along with tight financial conditions and low consumer sentiment, indicates a need for accommodative measures to stimulate the economy."}, {"sentence": "Further more , I acknowledge that there are  downside risks, among them the possibility  that the degree of  bank lending  restraint  and uncertainty could weigh on economic activity  more than I expect .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The acknowledgment of downside risks, including the possibility of bank lending restraint and uncertainty impacting economic activity more than expected, indicates a cautious approach towards tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The Labor Market  Even as GDP growth has slowed, employment has continued to increase, and the current labor market is one of the stronges t that U.S. workers have experienced in   - 2 - decades.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. Despite the slowdown in GDP growth, the strong labor market indicates a positive outlook for the economy. This implies that the Federal Reserve may maintain its accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth."}, {"sentence": "The economy created  253,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate was 3.4 percent, the lowest since 1969.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates a strong labor market performance with a significant increase in job creation and a historically low unemployment rate. It suggests a positive outlook for the economy, which could be seen as hawkish or supportive of a neutral monetary policy stance."}, {"sentence": "Job creation has been remarkably resilient to tighter financial conditions.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite tighter financial conditions, job creation has remained strong and resilient. It implies a dovish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates that the current conditions have not negatively impacted employment, reducing the need for a more hawkish approach."}, {"sentence": "Employers have added an average of 280,000 jobs a month this year.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence indicates a strong and consistent job growth in the US economy. It is relevant to US monetary policy as it suggests a positive economic outlook, which could be seen as hawkish, potentially leading to a more aggressive approach in tightening monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "The tight labor market has boosted wages and other compensation for workers .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish implication on US monetary policy. The tight labor market leading to boosted wages and compensation for workers indicates potential inflationary pressures. This could prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish stance by considering tightening monetary policy to curb inflation."}, {"sentence": "Wage growth has continued to run ahead of the pace consistent with 2 percent inflation and current trends in productivity growth.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of wage growth running ahead of inflation and productivity growth indicates potential concerns about inflationary pressures. This could imply a need for tighter monetary policy to curb inflation, making it relevant to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Wage gains are welcome a s long as they are consistent with price stability.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that wage gains are viewed positively as long as they align with price stability, implying a balanced approach. It does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, making it irrelevant in terms of signaling a specific policy direction."}, {"sentence": "Over the 12 months ended in March 2023, the employment cost index (ECI) for total hourly compensation for private -sector workers rose 4.8 percent, down only a little from its peak of 5.5 percent last Jun e.      My expectation is that the slowing economy will soon begin to reduce job growth , with labor supply and labor demand coming into better balance.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of the slowing economy and the expectation of reduced job growth indicates a cautious approach. However, the reference to labor supply and demand coming into better balance implies a potential shift towards a more dovish stance in the future."}, {"sentence": "The unemployment rate  may rise  gradually  to levels still consistent with a growing economy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the potential gradual rise in the unemployment rate is not a cause for concern as long as it remains consistent with a growing economy."}, {"sentence": "Data on jo b openings and voluntary quits by workers indicate that labor demand has eased somewhat , and this is reflected also in a modest decline in the growth of average hourly earnings, from a 12-month rate of 5 percent in November to 4.4 percent in April.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The easing of labor demand and decline in average hourly earnings growth indicate a slowdown in the economy, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more accommodative approach to stimulate economic growth."}, {"sentence": "Inflation  Now let me turn to the outlook for inflation .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence is neutral as it simply introduces the topic of inflation without providing any indication of whether the FOMC's stance on monetary policy will be hawkish, dovish, or neutral."}, {"sentence": "While inflation  has come down substantially since last summer, it is still too high, and  by some measures progress has been slowing.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy.

This decrease suggests a dovish implication on US monetary policy as it shows a moderation in inflationary pressures, potentially reducing the urgency for tighter monetary measures."}, {"sentence": "That reflects substantial decreases in energy prices and a big slowdown in food inflation .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that there have been significant declines in energy prices and a significant decrease in food inflation. These factors could have a dovish effect on US monetary policy as they may contribute to lower overall inflation levels, potentially leading to a more accommodative stance by the Federal Reserve."}, {"sentence": "Cheaper energy and a slow down in food pric e   - 3 - increases are good news for lower - and middle -income households that spend a larger share of their income for  these items.", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the decrease in energy and food prices is beneficial for lower- and middle-income households. However, it does not provide any direct implications on US monetary policy, making it irrelevant in terms of determining a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."}, {"sentence": "But outside of energy and food, the progress on inflation remains a challenge .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that despite progress in controlling inflation in sectors other than energy and food, there are still challenges. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it does not explicitly indicate a hawkish or dovish approach."}, {"sentence": "Excluding these prices, which tend to be more volat ile than prices of other goods and services , leaves what we call \u201ccore\u201d inflation , and this measure is a useful guide to discern longer -lasting movements in  inflation.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the FOMC considers \"core\" inflation, excluding volatile prices, as a useful indicator for identifying longer-lasting movements in inflation. It implies a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the importance of monitoring stable inflation trends rather than reacting to short-term price fluctuations."}, {"sentence": "Core PCE inflation  was 4.6 percent in March, down from a peak of 5.4 percent in February 2022 .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence indicates that core PCE inflation decreased from its peak in February 2022 to 4.6 percent in March. This decline suggests a potential easing of inflationary pressures, which could have a dovish implication on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "While we do not have  a report on PCE inflation for April yet, another inflation measure, the core component  of the consumer price index  (CPI) , showed little further improvement in Ap ril.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that the lack of improvement in the core component of CPI in April may not have a significant impact on the Federal Open Market Committee's decision-making process."}, {"sentence": "Looking more closely at core inflation, I like to divide it into three parts \u2014core goods inflation ; housing, which is classified as a service ; and nonhousing services.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It suggests a detailed analysis of core inflation, dividing it into three parts. However, it does not provide any indication of whether the analysis leans towards a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance, making it irrelevant in terms of its implications on US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Core good s inflation fell sharply over the second half of 2022  as supply -chain bot tlenecks eased , but more recently it has stabilized  at around 2.6 percent .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of core goods inflation falling and supply-chain bottlenecks easing implies a dovish tone, indicating a potential need for accommodative measures. However, the stabilization of inflation at around 2.6 percent indicates a more hawkish sentiment, suggesting a possible need for tightening measures. Overall, the sentence implies a balanced approach to monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Housing services  inflation , which include s rent and the equivalent for owner -occupied homes, is 8.2 percent  on a 12 -month basis .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence indicates that housing services inflation is at 8.2 percent on a 12-month basis. However, it does not provide any direct implications on US monetary policy. Therefore, it can be considered irrelevant in terms of its impact on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Housing is a big part of inflation, and while rent increases on new leases have come down considerably over the past year, it will take some time for this softening in rents  to show through  to the  12-month changes.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the impact of housing on inflation but highlights that rent increases on new leases have decreased significantly. However, it also implies that the effects of this softening in rents may take time to reflect in the 12-month changes, indicating a cautious approach."}, {"sentence": "And, finally,  inflation in nonhousing services, the largest component of services , has been stubbornly high at around 4.5 percent  and show s no signs of significant decline  yet.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it highlights the persistence of high inflation in nonhousing services, which is a concern. The lack of significant decline indicates that the current policy measures may not be effective in curbing inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "Recent Stress in the Banking Sector  Overall, the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient, and I am confident it will be able to c ontinue to play its important role providing credit to households and businesses.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The statement acknowledges recent stress in the banking sector but expresses confidence in the soundness and resilience of the US banking system, indicating that it will continue to support credit provision."}, {"sentence": "Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that recent  stress events will lead   - 4 - some banks to tighten credit standards further .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests that recent stress events may lead some banks to tighten credit standards further. This indicates a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it implies a potential tightening of credit conditions, which could restrict borrowing and slow down economic growth."}, {"sentence": "The evidence is that so far there has been only a modest incremental tightening of lending conditions, which had already tightened considerably over the past year since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. It indicates that there has been only a modest tightening of lending conditions, despite previous considerable tightening. This implies that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have had limited impact, which supports a more cautious and accommodative approach."}, {"sentence": "In a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve in April, loan officers reported that 46 percent of banks had tightened credit terms in the previous three months for commercial and industrial lending to larger firms, versus 44.8 percent that had tightened in the January survey.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates an increase in credit tightening by banks for commercial and industrial lending to larger firms. This tightening may reflect a cautious approach by banks, potentially leading to a slowdown in economic activity."}, {"sentence": "The April survey\u2019s increase in the share of banks reporting ti ghtening was similar, though a bit larger, for commercial and industrial lending to smaller firms.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it indicates an increase in the share of banks reporting tightening for commercial and industrial lending to smaller firms. This implies a potential tightening of credit conditions, which aligns with a more restrictive monetary policy approach."}, {"sentence": "At this point, it is hard to tell how much of this tightening was in train already, after continued increases in interest rates, and it is likewise difficul t to say how much the stress in midsized banks will ultimately curtail credit in the coming year.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the impact of previous interest rate increases and the potential credit curtailment caused by stress in midsized banks. Therefore, it does not provide a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish stance."}, {"sentence": "Furthermore, there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the impact on household spending and business investment, and this uncertainty complica tes economic outlook forecasts.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The mention of uncertainty complicating economic outlook forecasts indicates a cautious approach, which aligns with a neutral stance. It does not provide a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish bias."}, {"sentence": "Although  the profitability of  property and casualty insurance companies in  2022 was reduced by natural catastro phes and inflation , the industry\u2019s capital appears  strong when considering a range of plausible stress events .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it discusses the profitability and capital strength of property and casualty insurance companies, without directly addressing the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or its implications on monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "For life insurers, the recent increase in interest rates has been a mostly welcome development that has supported higher investment returns but also poses risks, such as early withdrawals by some policyholders.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. The recent increase in interest rates has been beneficial for life insurers, as it has supported higher investment returns. However, it also poses risks, such as early withdrawals by policyholders, which could potentially impact the overall stability of the industry."}, {"sentence": "While the life insurance industry\u2019s capitalization remains strong,   - 5 - the use of reinsurance merits continued monitoring .", "label": 3, "reason": "This sentence is irrelevant to US monetary policy as it does not provide any indication or implications regarding the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) towards interest rates or the overall economy."}, {"sentence": "With that said, let me turn to monetary policy.", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the speaker is transitioning to discuss monetary policy. It is neutral as it does not provide any specific information about the stance or direction of US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Considerations for Monetary Policy  So what  factors will I consider in the coming weeks as I contemplate the appropriate stance of monetary policy going forward ?", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates a neutral stance on US monetary policy as it reflects the FOMC's intention to consider various factors in the upcoming weeks to determine the appropriate course of action.

It implies that policymakers should anticipate future economic conditions and adjust monetary measures accordingly, indicating a proactive approach to managing the economy."}, {"sentence": "It should be conducted so that longer -term inflation expectations are well  anchored around our inf lation target of 2 percent.", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy as it emphasizes the importance of conducting policy in a way that ensures longer-term inflation expectations are anchored around the 2 percent target."}, {"sentence": "Monetary policy  should also be  data dependent  to allow  for continuous learn ing about the underlying  structure of the economy as new data arrive .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of being data dependent and continuously learning about the economy's underlying structure as new data becomes available. This approach indicates a balanced and cautious approach, rather than being explicitly hawkish or dovish."}, {"sentence": "These principles  of monetary policymaking are always valuable , especially so when  the level of uncertainty is high, as it is now.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the principles of monetary policymaking are particularly valuable during times of high uncertainty, which implies a more cautious and potentially dovish approach to US monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "I am guided by the dual mandate assigned  to the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Congress :  price stability and maximum employment .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is guided by the dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, which implies a neutral stance. It highlights the importance of balancing both objectives in the decision-making process."}, {"sentence": "On the one hand, inflation is too high, and we have not yet made  sufficient progress  on reducing it .", "label": 1, "reason": "This sentence suggests a hawkish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of high inflation and insufficient progress in reducing it indicates a concern for price stability. This implies that the FOMC may consider tightening monetary policy to address the inflationary pressures."}, {"sentence": "On the other hand, GDP has slowed considerably this year, and even though the effect has been muted in the labor market so far, demand clearly has begun t o feel the effects of interest rates that are 5 percentage points higher than they were a little over a year ago.", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests a dovish stance on US monetary policy. The mention of slowed GDP and the impact of higher interest rates on demand indicate concerns about economic growth. The FOMC may consider maintaining or lowering interest rates to support the economy and mitigate the effects of the rate hike."}, {"sentence": "History shows that monetary policy works with long and vari able lags, and that a year is not a long enough  period for demand to feel the full  effect of higher interest rates .", "label": 2, "reason": "This sentence suggests a neutral stance on US monetary policy. It acknowledges that monetary policy takes time to have an impact and implies that a year is insufficient for the full effects of higher interest rates to be felt. Therefore, it highlights the importance of considering longer timeframes when assessing the effectiveness of monetary policy."}, {"sentence": "Another  factor weighing on my thinking  is the uncertainty about tighter lending standards  that I mentioned  earlier .", "label": 0, "reason": "This sentence suggests that the uncertainty surrounding tighter lending standards is influencing the speaker's thoughts.
