Mr. Chairman, how effective do you expect this \u2014these actions to be?  Do you\u2014 do you think a recession is inevitable and/or can be avoided?  Secondly, there was talk about additional programs that could come out \u2014for example, a  Primary D ealer Credit F acility or a T erm A uction F acility.  Do you expect those to be announced soon?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thank you.  So, based on our discussions today and many conversations with participants, it \u2019s fair to say that we have a range of views about the path of the economy, as is always the case with the Fed.  But, in general, I\u2019d say that we see the U.S. economy as having been in quite a strong position before the arrival of the virus.  We see that it is likely that the measures we take to protect ourselves from the virus will involve withdrawing from or reducing certain activities \u2014thinking there of travel, leisure, hospitality, those things \u2014and that \u2019s going to mean lower economic activity for a period of time.  These are choices that we make to protect ourselves \u2014appropriate choices that we make to protect ourselves from the virus.  So that means th at the second quarter is probably going to be weak \u2014in fact, in the view of many, output declining \u2014output  lower in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter.  After that, it\u2019 s very hard to say how big the effects will be or how long they will last .  And that \u2019s    going to depend, of course , on how widely the virus spreads, which is something that is highly uncertain, and I would say , in fact, unknowable.  We do know that the virus will run its course and that the U.S. economy will resume a normal level of activity.   In the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy \u2014ultimately , to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible. You also asked about other facilities.  I would point out that we have , of course , responded very strongly not just with interest rates, but also with liquidity measures today.  And we believe that what we did today will be beneficial to financial markets generally.  And as I said in my statement, we \u2019re prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.  Thanks.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I \u2019m wondering , are you considering negative interest rates at this point?   Is there a scenario in which you think that would be appropriate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, a s I\u2019ve noted on a number of occasions, really, the Committee \u2014as you know, we did a year -plus-long study of our tools and strategies and communications.  And we , really , at the end of that, and also when we started out, we view forward guidance and asset pu rchases\u2014asset purchases and also different variations and combinations of those tools as the basic elements of our toolkit once the federal funds rate reaches the effective lower bound\u2014so, really , forward guidance, asset purchases, and combinations of thos e.  You know, we looked at negative policy rates during the Global F inancial C risis, we monitored the ir use in other    jurisdictions , we continue to do so, but we do not see negative policy rates as likely to be an appropriate policy response here in the United States.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  I guess I wanted to understand, specifically , how the actions you\u2019 ve announced this evening will  get credit to households and firms that are going to see large drops in income and revenue.  And also, to the extent that they are needed, what steps would you recommend the fiscal authorities undertake \u2014again, to make sure that firms with large drops in i ncome and revenue don \u2019t go bust over the next few weeks or months?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So let me tell you how , I think \u2014what our tools can accomplish, and\u2014and  really what they \u2019re not designed to accomplish.  So what our liquidity operations \u2014and I\u2019ll talk specifically about the T reasury and MBS purchases \u2014are designed to do is to assure the proper functioning of the T reasury and MBS markets.  The Treasury market is one of the most important, perhaps the most important, market in the world.  It\u2019s probably the most l iquid large market in the world.  The MBS market is very important:   It\u2019s closely linked to the Treasury market , and it\u2019s the way that our monetary policy decisions flow through to borrowers in the real econom y.  So, two very important markets.  And they had reached levels of very high illiquidity , and\u2014to the point where we \u2014as you know , last week we offered financing \u2014very large amounts of financing.  And after that, we bought assets across the curve to try to support liquidity and return to normal function.  And we found that that helped, but , nonetheless, we thought we had to do more.  And we knew what we had to do, which was the asset purchase program s that we did today.  And those are designed to restore those key markets to normal function.    Now, why is that important to \u2014to everyone?  These markets are part of the foundation of the global financial system and of the United States financial system.  And if they are not functioning well, then other markets \u2014then that will spread to other markets.  And those are the markets that \u2014that amount to \u2014that \u2014where households and businesses typically get credit.  So we know that dysfunctional financial markets \u2014a dysfunctional financial system, really, can have very big negative effects on the economy.  We saw that during  the financial crisis.  This is a very different situation , but, nonetheless, we thought it was quite important for us to take strong measures to support \u2014to support  proper market function in these important markets.  Now, you asked about households.  It\u2019s true, we don \u2019t have the tools to reach individuals and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work or whose businesses may not \u2014may experience a period of very low activity.  We don\u2019 t have those tools.  We have the tools that we have, and we use them.  I think we \u2019ve used them quite aggressively for the benefit of the public.  But this is a multifaceted problem, a nd it requires answers from different parts of the government and society.  I mean , I think th at, by far , the most important is the response of the health- care workers and health -care policymakers.  After that, fiscal policy.  We \u2019ve had one round of fiscal policy, another coming.  I think fiscal policy is a way to direct relief , really , to particul ar populations and groups.  Monetary policy has a role , and it really is in , you know \u2014our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they\u2019re under stress , and that\u2019s\u2014that \u2019s really part of what we did today.  The other role is to suppor t demand through lower interest rates, and we did that. You\u2014you asked about fiscal as well , and I guess I \u2019ve sort of covered that.  We do think fiscal response is \u2014is critical , and we \u2019re happy to see that those measures are being considered , and we \u2014we  hope they are effective.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  In your statement, you say that the market measures of inflation have declined .  The Fed has undershot inflation in the last year , and that \u2019s become one of the focuses of the FOMC meeting s.  Now, does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming , and is this large cut meant to get in front of any  more inflation?  Plus, as a second question, would the Fed consider buying securities outside of T reasuries and mortgage- backed securities?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right.   So, on\u2014on inflation, you know , the\u2014the econom y\u2019s performed so well, really , over the last few years , and right up through January :  historically low unemployment \u201450- year-low unemployment for a couple of years, 11 years \u2014almost 11 years of expansion so far , and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent.  So we \u2019ve been concerned that inflation not move down further.  It\u2019s not at all a question of deflation.  It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way.  So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judge d that the \u2014the  net effects of this will be to \u2014to have inflation move down e ven a little bit more.  And it\u2019s \u2014it\u2019 s not a question\u2014it\u2019 s not \u2014it\u2019s not an issue of deflation.  Again, it \u2019s just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further.  We expect, with uncertainty, that , you know \u2014that it will fall a little bit further , at least , below where it has been.   We are\u2014of course, we don \u2019t have the legal authority to buy other securities other than the ones we already buy , and we \u2019re not seeking authority to do so.  We haven \u2019t discussed that at the \u2014at the  FOMC , and it\u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s n ot legal authority that we \u2019re seeking.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chair Powell.  This is Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times.  You have talked about the mortgage -backed security purchases and t he    Treasury purchases as a stability \u2014a stability  operation.  I\u2019m pretty sure that every person on this call has an editor asking to determine whether or not this is quantitative easing.  How do we draw a distinction between these asset purchases and something you may do in the future that is explicit quantitative easing?  Or can we think of this as the first step in quantitative easing?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So w hat\u2014what  I can tell you definitive ly is what the purpose of the asset purchases was , and I mentioned this in my statement.  And it really is to support the availability of credit in the economy \u2014households and businesses \u2014and thereby support the overall economy.  How do they do that?  They d o that by supporting proper market functioning in the T reasury market and the MBS market.  So you see \u2014and I think you \u2019ll see \u2014as these purchases roll forward, you will see the T reasury market and the MBS market returning to normal market function , and that will actually support economic activity.  That will be a positive for economic activity.  In terms of what it\u2019 s labeled , that \u2019s of less interest to me.  I really  think we are very clear in our minds what we \u2019re doing this for and what the logical effects would be, which would be \u2014which would be both better market function and\u2014 and\u2014you know, when there \u2019s better market function, it will be \u2014you know, policy will be supporting the economy better.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to ask some timing questions here.   First, on the \u2014whatever it is, QE or not QE, you talk in the press release about increase \u201cover coming months.\u201d   Is there a timetable for that?  How long are we talking about \u2014$700 billion , obviously , over two months is a lot different from $700 billion over the course of a year.  And do you have a date where you would reevaluate and perhaps add more or end the program?  And the same with the interest rate cut to zero \u2014how long do you think that might last, a nd    would you be inclined to quickly go back to a higher level, the 100 basis points or more that you cut it from?  Or would you anticipate that this will be a long, slow process going back?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Okay, so \u2014sorry.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mike, can you ask your question?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  What was it again ?  W hat was the question again?  Just tell me .  I can\u2019t read my writing.  [Laughter]\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: I was asking about timing.  How long a period\u2014\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ah, okay, great.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: \u2014 are we talking about for the QE purchases , and how long do you anticipate keeping rates low, and how fast would you bring them back up again?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Okay , sorry.  So that \u2019s the \u201c in coming months \u201d language.   Let me tell you what we were doing there.  So there \u2019s no monthly cap here.  There's no weekly cap.  The Desk is going to go out , and it \u2019s going to buy at a strong rate that is \u2014that we think will restore market function\u2014restore liquidity as quickly as it can be restored.  And that language is open ended , and it\u2019s meant to send a signal to the market that\u2014that , you know, we \u2019re not going to be bound by, for example, $60 billion a month or anything like that.  We \u2019re going to go in strong starting tomorrow , and we \u2019re going to buy across the curve , and we \u2019re going to buy MBS , and we\u2019re really going to use our tools to do what we need to do here, which is restore these important markets to normal function.  So that \u2014that \u2019s really what that is.  As far as \u2014as the policy rate, what we \u2019ve said is that we  will maintain the rate at this level until we \u2019re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.  So, you can see, that \u2019s the test we\u2019ve written down.  And if you\u2014if you  look at it, you\u2019 ll see that some things have to happen    before we\u2019 d consider \u2014we\u2019d have to become confident of \u2014that the economy has weathered these recent events and also is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.  So that \u2019s a test we \u2019ll be looking at, and I think it suggests that , you know , we\u2019re going to be watching and willing to be patient , certainly.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, it\u2019 s Chris Rugaber at AP.  In 2008, you had a lot of coordination between the White House at that time, the Fed, the Treasury \u2014Bernanke doing a lot of things with Paulson and so forth.  You know, today the White House had its press conference at 5:00.  Y ou guys are doing something a little  separate.  Is there \u2014do you think it would be more helpful to market s\u2014perhaps , in the broader economy , to have a more coordinated response?   Is that something we might look for in the future?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, I would say this.  You know, we have differ ent tools.  I think we do, actually, work pretty closely with the Treasury Department and\u2014and  cooperate with them on things , with clear lines of delineation.  For example, the Treasury Department has authority over fiscal policy.  That \u2019s not our job.  It\u2019s their job , with other parts of the Administration.  It\u2019s just that \u2014like that for us with monetary policy.  We have sole responsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an independent, nonpolitical way.  So those two things are \u2014one for each of us. But in the middle there, there are areas where we \u2014where we can cooperate.  And also, there\u2019 s a long history .  You would want the finance ministry and  the t reasury [and the central bank] to be talking in every major econom y in the world.  You would want them to be regularly exchanging information\u2014professional relationships not just at the , you know , the Chair -to-Treasury -Secretary level, but also through the organization.  For example, the New York Fed is    the Treasury \u2019s agent\u2014fiscal agent , as you know , so there \u2019s a lot that goes into debt management and the issuance of debt , which happens at the New York Fed.  So I think we do, actually \u2014we have professional , good working relationships up and down the chain there , and, you know, that\u2014that  seems to me to be working.  And  there is \u2014there\u2019 s also quite a lot of coordination in other respects  with \u2014of course , with foreign central banks, but you didn\u2019 t ask about that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hey, sorry, I \u2019m here.  I think \u2014hi, Chair Powell .  Two questions this evening.  First, have you personally been tested for coronavirus , and are you working from home?  If you could shed some li ght on the precautions you\u2019 re taking .  And, second, do you believe the Fed has sufficient tools at the moment , or are you seeking congressional action to expand your tool  set\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I feel fine.  I feel very well , and so there \u2019s no reason for me to be tested.  We are observing \u2014we \u2019re trying to model good behavior here , so we \u2019re observing quite a lot of teleworking.   And also, we\u2019re\u2014 you know , we\u2019re not having a lot of big, crowded meetings \u2014we\u2019re not having any big, crowded meeting s.  So we \u2019re trying to observe all of the things that the professionals tell us to do.  I do expect to do some teleworking because I want to model that \u2014that it\u2019 s okay for the people to do so.  In fact, it \u2019s important for them to do so.  So I will do that.  In terms of our \u2014of our toolkit, let me say first that, you know , I think we do have plenty of space to adjust our policy.  I mentioned our liquidity tools \u2014you know , we have a lot of power in our liquidity tools , and, as I mentioned , we\u2019re prepared to use t hem.   In addition, we \u2019ve got plenty of space left to offer forward guidance, asset purchases, and adjust those policies , so I    think we do have room.  We\u2014we  have not at all made a decision to request further \u2014further tools or authorities from Congress, no.  We \u2014we  have not made that decision.  It is not something we \u2019re actively considering right now.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  This is Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.   Thanks for taking our questions.  I\u2019m just curious \u2014you know, obviously , you held this meeting in lieu of your meeting later this week.  Will you still release a Summary of Economic Projections ?  And if not, how should we understand how you guys are thinking about the economy as  the coronavirus shapes up?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So why no \u2014I guess you \u2019re asking , why no SEP , and what \u2019s our forecast?  So a couple reasons we didn\u2019 t do an SEP.  First, we decided on Thursday to move the meeting up by three days to today , and that \u2019s before the S EPs are generally filed.   They hadn\u2019 t been filled out , and we \u2014frankly , we spent our time focused on getting ready to make these announcements.  Second, and, you know , a number of FOMC participants had already reached out to make the point that the economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis , and it really is depending heavily on the spread of the virus and the measures taken to affect it and how long that goes on.  And that  is just not something that \u2019s knowable.  So , actually , writing down a forecast in that circumstance didn \u2019t seem to be useful , and, in fact, it could have been more of an obstacle to clear communication than a help.  I do expect that we\u2019 ll return to the quarterly \u2014regular quarterly cycle in June, however.  In terms of the forecast, so , as I mentioned, you know , we see the U.S. economy starting out strong \u2014from a strong position, different \u2014different  as we\u2014as we talk ed through it today .  People have a rang e of perspectives on the way the year is going to go , but I think there \u2019s a    pretty broad sense that the second quarter will be a weak quarter , with probably out \u2014you know, output declining a bit.  After that, it becomes hard to say , you know , what \u2019ll happen in the third and fourth quarters and thereafter , and it\u2019s going to depend, again , on\u2014on the path of the virus.  So the thing we do know is that we \u2019ll be here doing our job and supporting the flow of credit a nd there to do what we can when the recovery comes to make it as vigorous as possible\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell .  Craig Torres at Bloomberg News.  You say the path of the economy more or less depends on the path of the virus.  How importa nt is fiscal policy now in determining whether this sudden stop in activity is long or short  and of high human consequence or little human consequence?  And , second, can you talk a little bit about what \u2019s on your dashboard for economic and financial indica tors that you\u2019 re going to be watching day to day?  I know Vice Chair Clarida said that we should start seeing the data show up in April.  What are you going to be watching , and what should we be watching?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, in terms of fiscal policy, I thi nk in the first instance \u2014and you\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re  seeing some of this now \u2014is the thing that fiscal policy and , really , only fiscal policy can do is reach out directly to affected industries, affected workers , and we \u2019ve seen some of that.  So, that \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s  an imp ortant job for fiscal policy.  More broadly, after that , there \u2019s the question of \u2014of fiscal \u2014broader fiscal stimulus , and I think that \u2019ll depend on the path of the economy.  I\u2014I think there is such a wide range of possibilities here that it\u2019 s some \u2014it\u2019s very hard to predict.  But there could certainly be \u2014there could certainly be , you know , a need for that.  And your second question was \u2014what was your second question?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Ye s.  It was on what indicators you\u2019 re going to be looking at, financial an d real.   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, I think , in the very near term , we\u2019re going to be looking at , you know , the Treasury market function.  We \u2019re really going to be looking to see that financial markets are returning to more liquid , more normal functioning.  That is  an essential part of our job.  That is \u2014actually , you know, that is the thing that central banks were originally designed to do, was to provide liquidity to financial systems in stress , so we take that job very seriously.  It\u2019s probably the most important thing we \u2019re doing now is that .  So we \u2019ll be watching that a nd we \u2019ll be prepared to use our tools when and as appropriate to address \u2014to\u2014to support market functioning and really to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.  Those are the things I \u2019ll be looking at.  You know, in terms of economic data, I think it \u2019s just so early.  You know, we \u2019re really looking \u2014I mean , the economic data will follow the data on the spread of the virus.  You know, I think what happens \u2014what happens  during the spread of the virus is probably not going to tell you a lot about where the economy will be in six months.  It \u2019s going to be \u2014because you may have a \u2014you probably have a bad quarter in the second quarter, but if things get better in the third quarter, that p robably won \u2019t matter so much.  We may be able to come back from that.  If it lasts longer \u2014so that \u2019s really what I \u2019ll be looking for , is\u2014is what is going to be the spread of the virus and what \u2019s the path it\u2019 s going to take and what are the effects on the economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  This is David Gura from NBC News .  And a lot of good questions here , so I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll turn to one that \u2019s more philosophical in nature.  And you\u2019 ve talked a bit about the \u2014the disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak and having lower economic activity for a period of time.   I\u2019m reckoning with fact that my kid \u2019s going to be out of school until April 20 at the earliest, s o we \u2019re feeling this very , very acutely .  But I wonder if you    could just give us your perspective on the time horizon here and put that into some broader context \u2014how you look at this a nd how anomalous this thing is with which you and your colleagues are going to have to reckon.  That \u2019s my first que stion. The second is , you know , we\u2019ve seen a variety of tools here deployed over these last few weeks , and the market \u2014which I know is something that you pay at least minimal attention to \u2014has reacted negatively to some of that.  What do you make of that?  G oing back to the question that was asked earlier about the toolbox and\u2014and  what \u2019s left \u2014what\u2019s left  in it, r ates are low.  Does that provoke any apprehension, any nervousness on your part that there are fewer tools therein?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I guess your fi rst question is , how \u2014how  do we think about the time\u2014the time  for this thing ?  You know \u2014and the truth is , we just don\u2019 t know , and, you know , the experts we talk to will say that they don \u2019t know , and that it \u2019s, in fact , unknowable.  It\u2019s going to depend on a number of things.  First, it\u2019 s the measures that we take to , you know , to\u2014with the social distancing , and the \u2014all the things businesses and school and everyone \u2019s doing  now .  And that will depend , to some extent , on how compliant people are.  You can see that some countries have had a \u2014have been able to , through aggressive measures and really high compliance \u2014have been able to bend the curve and\u2014and  do that.  And whether we succeed  or\u2014you know, that \u2019s really the question.  And I wouldn\u2019 t\u2014I wouldn\u2019t , you know \u2014I\u2019ll resist the impulse to guess.  I really don \u2019t know what that will be.  In terms of the toolbox, as I mentioned, we think we have plenty of policy space left, plenty of power left in our tools , and I would point in particular to the  liquidity tools.  That , I think, is \u2014is right now the most important thing that we \u2019re doing.  Our interest rates will matter \u2014cuts will matter now to borrowers who will get some relief from our cuts , but they \u2019ll    matter a lot more when the economy begins to recover.  So \u2014but in the forefront now are the liquidity tools and\u2014and  getting that job done well.  In addition, as I mentioned, we \u2014you know , we have room to provide forward guidance, to do more asset purchases.  I think there \u2014there  is room for us to do what we need to do.  I\u2014I would just close , though,  by saying  that, you know , typically , fiscal policy does play a major role when \u2014when  there are downturns.  You  saw\u2014you\u2019ve seen that in many past downturns , and that\u2019s beyond just the automatic stabilizers.  Sometimes fiscal policy comes in on a discretionary basis , and that \u2014that  will probably need to be the case here as well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Victoria Guida with Politic o.  Thanks for doing the call.  I just wanted to ask , do you see a bigger role here for the Financial Stability Oversight Council?  With all the stress that\u2019 s showing up in different markets , do you see risks  to financial stability rising ?  Do you think there are some activities that FSOC might want to crack  down on?  And are you confident that there aren \u2019t any nonbanks that are systemically important?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: FSOC is really something that the Treasury Secretary chairs.  And it\u2019s a big group\u2014it\u2019 s got  a lot of people.  I think it serves a good purpose.  But, you know, you should know that we are , of course , in regular contact with the other regulatory agencies , constantly talking about what \u2019s going on in markets.  There\u2019 s a lot of information and conve rsation on an ongoing basis there , I would say.  So \u2014and the same is true with our central bank contacts around the world.  W e\u2019re in ongoing contact with all the major central banks around the world, talking about what \u2019s going on.  We\u2019re having group calls, we \u2019re calling one-on-one, so there \u2019s quite a lot of information being exchanged there.     And then, your question was , nonbank SIFIs.  You know , again, that \u2019s a judgment for the\u2014that\u2019s a judgment for the  FSOC.  I\u2014you know , I\u2019m comfortable with the actions th at we\u2019 ve taken , and if\u2014if we do identify , you know, a systemically important nonbank institution , then we wouldn\u2019 t hesitate to designate it, but \u2014although I guess now we \u2019re working more on activities , but we do still have the power to designate institutions, so \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Financial stability risks \u2014are those rising?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I\u2019m sorry, the question was \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Are risks to financial stability rising , given all the stress that \u2019s happening in financial m arkets?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, yes.  I would say , you know , that \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s  something that happens when markets are as volatile as they are, w hen you\u2019 re having these big market movements while markets are trying to understand what \u2019s going on.  They \u2019re trying to reach a view on\u2014in high uncertainty , and that \u2019s why you see lots and lots of volatility.  I think there \u2019s more risk to financial stability in an era like \u2014like  that than there is when things are really placid , and, you know, we \u2019re going home at 4 o\u2019 clock and kind of bored over here.  That \u2019s not the case right now.  So, financial stability \u2014I would say those \u2014those  risks do rise at a time of high volatility, particularly a time where we \u2019re presenting \u2014presented with a challenge that is \u2014is kind of unique , really \u2014it\u2019s not something we \u2019ve all done before.  I also want to add, though, that, you know , we\u2019re strongly focused on financial stability.  We monitor it carefully.  We\u2019ve built a very resilient financial system.  The banks are highly capitalized, lots o f liquidity, much better at understanding and managing their risks, their resilience to stress.   So our financial stability focus \u2014our focus on an event like this over the last    10 years will pay dividends , in the sense that you have a much more resilient fi nancial system than you\u2019 ve had before.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, this is Jean Yung.  I wanted to ask, a few days ago the Open Market Desk expanded its term repo operations, but the take -up was a bit low.  Is that \u2014did y ou have any takeaway from that?  Did that indicate to you that the repos were not working as you had envisioned it , or was there something else that you learned from that?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thank you.  Yes, so we saw, and everyone saw , that liquidity had become very strained in Treasury and MBS markets , and we decided to offer very large quantities of term and overnight repo to address that.  That makes it easier to finance the purchase of repos \u2014sorry, of Treasuries and MBS.   So we did that , and as you pointed out, the take- up was not as high as many had expected , and I did\u2014we did learn something from  that.  We thought that was worth doing , and what we learned was that we needed to go direct here rather than trying to intermed iate through the dealers.  And so we realized at that point that we would need to actually purchase securities for our portfolio, s o we did that on Friday.  We bought \u2014the next day , Friday, we went in and we bought across the curve , and we bought, I think, $ 37 billion worth of securities , and then we saw what happened with that.  We saw that market function improved a little bit, but still it wasn \u2019t what we needed.  And that \u2019s why we brought together the full FOMC and had our meeting this afternoon and announced these measures this evening, which are strong measures , with the  broad support of the Committee to provide really substantial amounts of liquidity.  And I \u2014I think you can see us working through different solutions and\u2014and  finding the one that we think really will work and then acting quite vigorously, quite aggressively tonight to implement it.  \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Chair Powell.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Two things , if I could.  Could you describe any discussions you\u2019 ve had in coordination with the major banks \u2014this whole talk of drawing down liquidity, drawing down capital buffers \u2014how far can they draw it down?  How much do you think they can put out \u2014out  to customer finance?  Did you get explicit agreements for them that this will go to customer finance and not something else?   And then, secondly, is there any discussion yet of \u2014of using the 13(3) powers of the Fed to do some sort of direct lending facilit y\n\nCHAIR POWELL: We  have given broad general guidance to the banks.  We\u2019d like them to use their buffers to provide \u2014you know, to provide  loans and\u2014and  also to work with their borrowers .  As you can see, we \u2019re providing a lot of guidance to them across a w ide range, a nd they\u2019re saying they have every intention of doing that.  That \u2019s good to hear.  A nd\u2014s o we \u2019ll see how that works out.  There \u2014there are a lot of discussions going on, and, you know , we hear the banks saying , that \u2019s exactly what they \u2019re going to  do, s o that \u2019s a good thing.

So, as I said, we\u2019re\u2014we \u2019re prepared to use our authorities as is appropriate to\u2014you know, to support borrowing and lending in the economy , and, hence, to support the availability of credit to households and businesses\n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 4, "dovish": 29, "neutral": 26}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 0, "dovish": 2, "neutral": 18}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 4, "dovish": 31, "neutral": 44}, "speech_summary": "The Federal Reserve took multiple actions to support the economy and promote the flow of credit amidst the disruptions caused by the coronavirus, acknowledging the profound impact it has had on people worldwide. They reduced the policy interest rate by 1 percentage point, brought it close to zero, and implemented other measures to support credit flow to households and businesses.Despite a strong economic outlook with low unemployment rates, solid job gains, high labor force participation, rising wages, and overall moderate economic activity, the virus poses significant economic challenges.The FOMC expects that the illness and measures to contain it will significantly impact the economy in the near term, particularly in travel, tourism, and hospitality industries. The outbreak is also affecting foreign economies, causing difficulties for US industries reliant on global supply chains, and leading to a drop in exports. Additionally, the energy sector is under stress due to the decline in global oil prices. Inflation is likely to be held down by the outbreak, and financial conditions have tightened with increased credit costs and sharp declines in stock markets. The rapidly evolving situation has resulted in high volatility in financial markets as everyone tries to assess the future.The recent stress and impaired liquidity in the Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities markets have prompted the Federal Reserve to announce plans to purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and $200 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these markets and improve overall financial conditions.The Federal Reserve took several actions to support credit flow, including reducing the interest rate on discount window loans and offering longer loan periods. They also coordinated with major central banks to address potential pressures in global borrowing and lending markets by reducing pricing on dollar swap lines.The Federal Reserve has announced that central banks will offer dollars for a longer term, and these arrangements pose no risk to the Federal Reserve or taxpayers. Other actions taken include eliminating reserve requirements for banks and encouraging the use of intraday credit and capital and liquidity buffers to support lending. These measures aim to help the economy during the coronavirus crisis and promote a strong economic recovery, while closely monitoring economic and financial developments. The Federal Reserve is prepared to use all available tools to support credit flow and achieve maximum employment and price stability. Additionally, the FOMC meeting held today replaces the previously scheduled meeting for next week.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': How effective do you expect these actions to be? Do you think a recession is inevitable and/or can be avoided? Do you expect additional programs to be announced soon?\n'ANSWER': We have a range of views about the path of the economy, but in general, we see the U.S. economy as having been strong before the virus. The measures to protect ourselves from the virus will lead to lower economic activity, especially in the second quarter. The effects and duration of the virus are uncertain. The Fed will continue to support credit flow and demand with monetary policy. We have already responded strongly with interest rates and liquidity measures, and we are prepared to use our full range of tools.", "'QUESTION': Are you considering negative interest rates at this point? Is there a scenario in which you think that would be appropriate?\n'ANSWER': Negative policy rates are not likely to be an appropriate policy response in the United States. The Federal Reserve views forward guidance, asset purchases, and combinations of those tools as the basic elements of their toolkit once the federal funds rate reaches the effective lower bound. They have studied negative policy rates but do not see them as suitable for the current situation.", "'QUESTION': How will the actions announced by the FOMC provide credit to households and firms experiencing drops in income and revenue, and what steps should fiscal authorities take to prevent firms from going bankrupt?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC's liquidity operations, specifically Treasury and MBS purchases, aim to ensure the functioning of these markets. Dysfunction in these markets can spread to other markets where households and businesses get credit. However, the FOMC does not have the tools to directly reach individuals and small businesses. Fiscal policy and healthcare response are crucial in addressing this multifaceted problem.", "'QUESTION': Does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming and is the large cut meant to get in front of any more inflation? Would the Fed consider buying securities outside of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is not concerned about deflation, but rather about not reaching the inflation target. The coronavirus is expected to cause inflation to fall even further. The Fed does not have the legal authority to buy securities other than the ones they already buy and they are not seeking authority to do so.", "'QUESTION': How do we draw a distinction between the current asset purchases and future quantitative easing?\n'ANSWER': The purpose of the asset purchases is to support credit availability and market functioning. As these purchases continue, the Treasury and MBS markets will return to normal, supporting economic activity. The label of quantitative easing is less important than the intended effects of better market function and support for the economy.", "'QUESTION': Is there a timetable for the increase in QE? How long will it last? When will the program be reevaluated? How long will the interest rate cut to zero last? Will the interest rate quickly go back to a higher level or will it be a slow process?\n\n'ANSWER': Chairman Powell apologizes and does not provide a direct answer to the timing questions regarding the increase in QE and the duration of the program. He also does not provide a specific timeline for the interest rate cut to zero or whether it will quickly go back to a higher level.", "'QUESTION': Can you please repeat the question?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell asks the reporter to repeat the question as he is unable to read his own writing.", "'QUESTION': I was asking about timing. How long a period\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n'ANSWER': Ah, okay, great.", "'QUESTION': How long do you anticipate keeping rates low and how fast would you bring them back up again?\n'ANSWER': The Fed will buy assets at a strong rate to restore market function and liquidity, without being bound by a specific monthly or weekly cap. The policy rate will be maintained at the current level until the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve maximum employment and price stability goals. The Fed will be patient and watchful.", "'QUESTION': Is it more helpful to have a coordinated response between the White House, the Fed, and the Treasury in order to benefit the markets and the broader economy?\n'ANSWER': While the Fed and the Treasury have different responsibilities, they do work closely together with clear lines of delineation. The Treasury has authority over fiscal policy, while the Fed has sole responsibility for monetary policy. However, there are areas where they can cooperate, and there is a long history of professional relationships between the two organizations. Coordination also extends to foreign central banks.", "'QUESTION': Have you personally been tested for coronavirus and are you working from home? Do you believe the Fed has sufficient tools at the moment or are you seeking congressional action to expand your tool set?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell stated that he feels fine and has not been tested for coronavirus. The Fed is observing teleworking and avoiding crowded meetings. Powell believes they have enough tools to adjust policy, including liquidity tools and forward guidance, and they have not made a decision to seek additional tools from Congress.", "'QUESTION': Will the Federal Reserve still release a Summary of Economic Projections and how should we understand their thinking about the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve did not release a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) because the meeting was moved up and participants were focused on making announcements. The economic outlook is uncertain due to the evolving nature of the virus and the measures taken to combat it. The Fed expects a weak second quarter and the future depends on the path of the virus. They will continue to support the flow of credit and aim for a vigorous recovery.", "'QUESTION': How important is fiscal policy in determining the duration and impact of the economic slowdown caused by the virus? What indicators will the Fed be monitoring?\n'ANSWER': Fiscal policy is crucial in directly supporting affected industries and workers. The need for broader fiscal stimulus will depend on the path of the economy, which is difficult to predict given the wide range of possibilities. The Fed will be monitoring economic and financial indicators to assess the situation.", "'QUESTION': What indicators will the FOMC be looking at, both financial and real?\n'ANSWER': In the near term, the FOMC will focus on the Treasury market function and ensuring that financial markets return to normal functioning. This is crucial as central banks were designed to provide liquidity during times of stress. They will also monitor the flow of credit to households and businesses. Economic data will follow the spread of the virus, but it may not accurately predict the economy's state in six months. The FOMC will closely observe the virus's spread and its impact on the economy.", "'QUESTION': How do you think about the time horizon for the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on the economy? And what do you make of the negative market reaction to the tools deployed by the Fed?\n'ANSWER': The time horizon for the outbreak is uncertain and depends on measures taken and compliance. The toolbox still has plenty of policy space, particularly in terms of liquidity tools. Interest rate cuts will matter more when the economy recovers. Fiscal policy will likely play a major role in addressing the downturn.", "'QUESTION': Do you see a bigger role for the Financial Stability Oversight Council? Do you see risks to financial stability rising? Are there activities that FSOC might want to crack down on? Are you confident that there aren't any nonbanks that are systemically important?\n'ANSWER': FSOC serves a good purpose, but we are in regular contact with other regulatory agencies and central banks around the world to exchange information. The judgment on the role of FSOC and designation of systemically important nonbank institutions lies with FSOC. We are comfortable with the actions we have taken.", "not clear. Could you please repeat it?", "'QUESTION': Are risks to financial stability rising, given all the stress that's happening in financial markets?\n'ANSWER': Yes, risks to financial stability do rise during times of high volatility and uncertainty. However, the Federal Reserve is strongly focused on financial stability and has built a resilient financial system over the past 10 years, with highly capitalized banks and improved risk management. This focus will pay dividends in managing the current unique challenge.", "'QUESTION': Did the low take-up of term repo operations indicate that they were not working as envisioned or was there something else learned from it?\n'ANSWER': The low take-up of term repo operations indicated that a direct approach was needed instead of intermediating through dealers. As a result, the Federal Reserve decided to purchase securities for its portfolio, which improved market function but still fell short. The FOMC announced strong measures to provide substantial liquidity and is actively working to find a solution.", "'QUESTION': Could you describe any discussions you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had in coordination with the major banks regarding drawing down liquidity and capital buffers and how much they can put out to customer finance?\n'ANSWER': We have given general guidance to banks to use their buffers to provide loans and work with borrowers. Banks have expressed their intention to do so, which is positive. Discussions are ongoing, and while we have nothing to announce on using 13(3) powers, we are prepared to use our authorities to support borrowing, lending, and credit availability."]}
