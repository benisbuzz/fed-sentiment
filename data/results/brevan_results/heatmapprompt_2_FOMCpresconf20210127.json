Jeanna Smialek  from the New York Times. Thank you for taking our questions.  I was hoping that you would first react to the wild ride that game stock \u2014GameStop \u2019s stock has had this week.  And then, secondarily, you and your colleagues have repeatedly made it clear that you really plan to use macroprudential tools as the first line of defense when it comes to financial stability risks.  But your macroprudential tools primarily apply to the banks.  I \u2019m wondering what your plan is, if you see som e sort of large financial stability risk emanating from the nonbank financial sector in the coming months, especially as it relates to search -for-yield kind of activities.  You know, what, what do you see as the solution there?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , on, on your first question, I don\u2019 t want to comment on a particular company or, or day \u2019s market activity or things like that.  It \u2019s just not really something that I would typically comment on.  In terms of macroprudential policy tools, s o, as you know, no doubt, we rely on sort of always- on, through- the-cycle macroprudential policy tools, particularly the stress tests and also the elevated levels of liquidity and capital a nd, and , and also resolution planning that we \u2014that we impose on the l argest financial institutions.  We don\u2019 t use time -varying tests and tools as some other countries do.  And we think it \u2019s a good approach because\u2014 for us to use ones that are always- on\u2014 because we don \u2019t really think we \u2019d be successful in every case in picking  the exact right time to intervene in markets.  So that \u2019s for banks. You really asked about nonbanks, the nonbank sector.  And so we monitor financial conditions very broadly.  And while we don\u2019 t have jurisdiction over , over  many areas in the nonbank sector, other agencies do.  And so we do coordinate through the Financial Stability Oversight Council and with other agencies who have responsibility for , for nonbank supervision.     And, i n fact, as you know, in the last crisis, the banking system held up fairly well so far.  And , and the dislocations that we saw from the outsized economic and financial shock of the pandemic really appeared in the nonbank sector.  So that \u2019s\u2014right now we are engaged in, in carefully examining, understanding , and thinking about what , what  in the nonbank sector will need to be addressed in the next year  or so\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you so much, Michelle and Chair Powell.  I had a question on fiscal policy.  Last year you consistently said that the economy needed more fiscal support a nd, I believe, were pleased when the $900 billion package was approved in December.  We have \u2014now have a new , new  President , a new Congress.  We have a weakening short -term outlook.  Do you believe the economy still needs additional support on the fiscal side?  And in what areas?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thank you.  So I guess I \u2019d start by saying that the , the fiscal response that we \u2019ve seen to this downturn has be en strong , and I think we can say now that it \u2019s been sustained after th e passage of the\u2014of the , the most recent act in , in late December.  And that \u2019s really a key reason why the recovery has been as strong as it \u2019s been.  Fiscal policy has been absolutely essential.  When we look back on, on the history of this period, we \u2019ll see a strong and sustained fiscal policy response.  I would\u2014I would add that we \u2019re, as I mentioned, a long way from a full recovery.  Something like 9 m illion people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic.  That \u2019s as many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the G lobal F inancial C risis and the Great Recession.  Many small businesses are under pressure, and there ar e other needs to be addre ssed.  And the path ahead is still pretty uncertain.     So, all of that said, the judgment on how much to spend and in what way is really one for Congress and the A dministration and not for the Fed.  And these discussions are going on right now.  So there \u2019s a discussion, as you know, right now around, around those precise questions, and, and that \u2019s appropriate, but not for us to play a role in talking about specific policies\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. C hairman.  I wonder if I could follow up on Jeanna\u2019 s question here.  I understand that you do address issues of , of valuations through macroprudential policies in the first instance , but there \u2019s a range of assets .  And I know you do watch a range of assets.   But from Bitcoin to corporate bonds to the stock market in general to some of these more specific meteoric rises in stocks like GameStop , how do you address the concern that super easy monetary policy\u2014asset purchases and zero interest rates\u2014 are potential ly fueling a bubble that could cause economic fallout should it burst?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Let me \u2014let me  provide a little context.  The shock that the \u2014from the pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity.  There \u2019s nothing close to it in our modern economic history.  So our response was really to that .  And we\u2014we \u2019ve done what we could, first , to restore market function and to provide a bit of relief, then to support the recovery.  And , hopefully, we \u2019ll be able to do the third thing, which is to avoid longer -run damage to the \u2014to the economy.  Our role assigned by Congress is maximum employment a nd stable prices and also look after financial stability.  So, in a world where , almost a year later, we\u2019re, we\u2019re still 9  million jobs, at least \u2014that \u2019s one way of counting i t; it can actually be counted much higher than that \u2014short of maximum employment an d people are out of the labor force who were in the labor    force \u2014the real unemployment rate is close to 10  percent  if you include people that \u2019ve left the labor force \u2014it\u2019s very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to support maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2  percent  and averaging 2 percent  over time.  So, on, on matters of financial stability, we have a framework.  We don\u2019 t look at one thing or two things.  We look at \u2014and we made that framework public after the financial crisis so that it c ould be criticized and understood and we could be held accountable.  And , you know, the things that we look at are \u2014we do look at asset prices.  We also look at leverage in the banking system.  We look at leverage in the  non\u2014the  nonbanking system, which is to say , corporates and households.  And we look at also funding risk.  And if you look at it across that range of , of, of readings, they\u2019 re each different, but we monitor them carefully.  And I would say that financial stability vulnerabilities overall are moderate.  Our overall goal is to assure that the financial system itself is resilient to , to shocks of all kinds, that it \u2019s strong and resilient.  And that includes not just the banks, but money market funds and, and all different kinds of nonbank financial structures as well.  So when we get to the nonfinancial sector, we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019t  have jurisdiction over that.  But\u2014so I would just say that our \u2014that there are many things that go in, as you know, to, to setting asset prices.  So if you look at what \u2019s really been driving asset prices, really , in the last couple of months , it isn \u2019t monetary  policy.  It\u2019s been expectations about vaccines.  And it \u2019s also financial\u2014 sorry, fiscal policy .  Those are \u2014those are the news items that have been driving , driving asset purchases \u2014sorry, asset values in , in recent months.  So I, I know that monetary policy does play a role there , but that \u2019s how we look at it.  And I think, you know, I think that the connection between low interest rates and , and asset    values is probably something that \u2019s not as tight as people think, because a lot of \u2014a lot of  different factors are driving asset prices at any given time.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Can I  follow up, Michelle, if you don\u2019 t mind ?  Mr. Chairman, do you rule out or see as one of your tools in the toolkit the idea of adjusting monetary policy to address asset values?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, you know, that \u2019s\u2014as you know, that \u2019s one of the very difficult questions in all of monetary policy.  And we don \u2019t rule it out as a theoretical matter , but we , we clearly look to macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools rather than monetary policy in , in addressing financial stability issues.  It\u2019s not \u2014you know, the , the monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well -understood channels.  And a strong economy is actually a great supporter of financial stabilit y.  That will mean strong, you know, well -capitalized institutions , and, and households will be \u2014will be working.  And , and so we know that.  We don\u2019 t actually understand the tradeoff between\u2014the sense of it is, would you\u2014if you raise interest rates and ther eby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in order to address asset bubbles and things like that , what \u2014will that even help?  Will it \u2014will it actually cause more damage, or will it help?  So I think that \u2019s unresolved.  And I , I think it \u2019s, it\u2019s something we , we look at as not , not theoretically ruled out but not something we , we\u2014we \u2019ve ever done a nd not something we would plan to do.  We would rely on macroprudential and other tools to deal with financial stability issues.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Yes.  Thank you very much.  I wanted to ask you, if there is a near -term rise in inflation related to the recovery, how will you determine whether or not it \u2019s something that \u2019s temporary or more enduring?   And how much inflation is the F ed willing to tolerate before it acts to restrain price pressures?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , on inflation,  a couple of things \u2014there are a couple of things that are worth mentioning.  One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12 -month basis.  And as we \u2014as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, we\u2019ll see measured 12 -month inflation move up a few tenths.  This is just \u2014they\u2019 re called base effects , and, and that \u2019s a\u2014that\u2019s a transient thing that we think will pass.  There \u2019s also the possibility \u2014indeed, it \u2019s in some forecasts\u2014 that as the economy fully reopens, there \u2019ll be a burst of spending, and\u2014because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation.  Now, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large.  I n both cases, we d on\u2019t see those as either lasting or particularly large.  So the way we would react is, we\u2019re going to be patient.  Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we would review \u2014we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation.  I think  if you \u2014you know, it helps to look back at , at the inflation dynamics that the United States has had now for some decades a nd notice that there has been, you know, significant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades.  Inflation has averaged less than 2  percent  for a quarter of a century.  And the inflation dynamics , with the flat Phillips c urve and low persistence of inflation , is very much intact.  Those things, they change over time.  We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don\u2019 t    change rapidly.  So we think it \u2019s very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you know, troubling inflation. Of course, if w e did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have tools for that.  It\u2019 s far harder to deal with , with  too low inflation.  We know what to do with higher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we , we would have those tools.  And we don\u2019 t expect to see that at all.  In terms of how much, you know, what we \u2019ve said is we \u2019d like to see \u2014because inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent , we\u2019d like to see it run moderately above 2  percent  for some time.  We have no t adopted a formula.  We\u2019re not going to adopt a formula.  We\u2019re going to\u2014w e, we use policy rules and formulas in everything we do, consult them constantly, but we don\u2019 t set policy by them.  We don \u2019t do that.  And so we \u2019re going to preserve an element of judgment.  And, again, we \u2019ll seek inflation moderately above 2  percent  for some time.  And we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent .  The , the way to achieve credibility on that is to actually do it.  And so that \u2019s what we \u2019re planning on doing\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  I have a two -pronged question about vaccines.  So you specifically mentioned progress in the rollout of vaccines , but there is still plenty that we don \u2019t know about supply over the coming weeks and months.  So I \u2019m curious how you and your colleagues are factoring in vacci ne rollouts and funding for distribution in your forecasts and what that timeline looks like.  And then, secondly, I \u2019m wondering if you, yourself haven\u2019t \u2014has been \u2014have been vaccinated , along with other FOMC members.  Thank you.  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , in terms of the rollout of the vaccines, we see what everyone else sees, right?  We see that we\u2019 re, we\u2019re  vaccinating people and at a rate of about a million a day, apparently , and that  it\u2019ll take quite a while to get \u2014to get  to the numbers that the expert s say are required to get to herd immunity.  And we think it \u2019s going to be a struggle.  You\u2019ll notice that we , we said that the , the pandemic still, still  provides considerable downside risks to the economy.  And that\u2019s one of the reasons why, is that \u2014is th e slowness of the rollout.  The other \u2014another reason why is just the arrival of these new virus strains.  We don\u2019t know how to\u2014we do n\u2019t know how to model that.  You know, we can have a base case, but we realize no one knows how the \u2014how this new vaccine wil l roll out, how successful it will be, how high we \u2019ll be able to drive vaccination, and those sorts of things.  So we have a base case, and we \u2014but we always \u2014we always look at , at the range of possibilities.  In this case, we particularly look at the downside risks.  You know, that \u2019s really what we do is , we, we set policies so that we\u2019re , we\u2019re, you know , we\u2019re going to remain accommodative until we actually see improvement in the economy and not just in the outlook, in the data.  So that\u2019s, that \u2019s how we think about , about  that.  And I would\u2014I would also add, there \u2019s nothing more important to the economy now than, than people getting vaccinated.  You know, if you\u2014if you, you think about the places where the economy is weak\u2014I mentioned bars and restaurants .  That\u2019s 400,000 jobs we lost last month, a nd that \u2019s all because of the spread of the pandemic.  Many other  areas of the economy \u2014actually, there was actually job creation in \u2014you know, in goods production and in some service parts \u2014industries as well.  But we \u2019re just not going to be able to get that last group of people back to work\u2014and it \u2019s a big group of people \u2014until we get the pandemic behind us.     We, we  have not won this yet.  We haven \u2019t succeeded in doing this yet , and we need to stay focused on it as a country and , and get there .  And, you know, we clearly can, but we \u2019re going to have to stay focused.  A nd that includes \u2014you know, that includes us at the F ed, monetary policy.  I, I have been vaccinated once, and I expect to get my second vaccine sometime soon.  Thank you\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  A question\u2014 I have a question that I was going to ask, but I need to follow up for a second on the questions about the markets and macroprudential , and that is, you have one tool you can use .  Would you be discussing\u2014 have you discussed raising margin requirements under R egulation T?  And, if not, why not?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: No, we haven\u2019 t\u2014we haven\u2019t  done that.  I mean, remember, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  focused on maximum employment, price stability, financial stability as I defined it\u2014 the broad financial sector.  And, and that \u2014that\u2019s  not, you know \u2014over the years, we, we  consult the fact that we have that authority.  But , no, it \u2019s not something we \u2019re loo king at right now at all.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  All right.  My follow -up question is, a lot of people in the markets think that you\u2019 re basically stuck right now, because you can\u2019 t really go lower with the zero bound, rejecting negative interest rates , and you ca n\u2019t really go higher because of the thr eat of a taper tantrum.  Is the F ed locked into a very narrow corridor now?  And , if not, you did say you would signal any change in interest rates a long time ahead.  But [former]  New York F ed President Bill Dudley s ays there \u2019s no way you can avoid a taper tantrum.  So how do you do that?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: ell, first , I\u2014we , we think our policy stance is , is just right.  We think it \u2019s providing significant support for economic activity and hiring.  We, you know, we , we adopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August.  In September, we, we implemented rate guidance that , that  was consistent wit h and based on that new framework.  In December, we did the same for asset purchases.  So we now have, you know, strong guidance on, on rates and on asset purchases that \u2019s providing very strong support for economic activity.  If you look at the sectors of t he economy that are interest sensitive, you will see very strong activity :  housing, durable goods, automobile sales.  So, you know, our , our policies are working.  And we think that , that  they are \u2014we think our policy stance is , is right.  That said, there\u2019 s clearly more that we can do.  With asset purchases, for example,  we can, you know \u2014that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a tool we can do more \u2014we can strengthen our guidance , too, if we were to think that that were appropriate.  What you see is an economy where what \u2019s holding it back is not the lack of , of policy sup port from the F ed.  It\u2019 s the pandemic .  It\u2019s, it\u2019s the spread of the disease and people \u2019s reluctance or , or inability to partake in certain kinds of economic activities, which amount to a , a meaningful part of the economy.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  what I would say.  We certainly have things that we can do, but we think we \u2019re\u2014we think we\u2019re  in the right  place.  You know, in terms of \u2014in terms of tapering, it \u2019s just premature.  We just created the, the  guidance.  We said we \u2019d want to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we modify our , our asset purchase guidance.  It \u2019s just too early to be talking about dates, which we should be focused on, on  progress.  We\u2019ll need to see actual progress.  And when, when we see ourselves getting to that point, we \u2019ll communicate clearly about it to , to the public  so nobody    will be surprised when the time comes.  And we \u2019ll do that well in advance of actually considering what will be a pretty gradual  taper.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Well, if I might, you\u2014your policies are working, and you can maybe do more.  But the question is, can you stop doing it when it \u2019s time?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  So, you know, I , I was here\u2014we had all the same questions back in \u2014after the G lobal F inancial Crisis.  We raised interest rates .  We froze the balance sheet size, and then we shrank the balance sheet size.  So there \u2019s no reason why we , we won \u2019t be able to do that again.  In fact, we learned a lot from that experience.  And, you know, we , we understand \u2014as we understood then, but even more so\u2014we understand that the \u2014that the way to do it is to communicate well in advance, to , to do predictab le things, and to move gradually.  And that \u2019s, that\u2019s  what we \u2019re going to do.  We\u2019 re going to be very transparent.  But, honestly, no\u2014you know, the whole focus on exit is premature , if I may say.  We \u2019re focused on finishing the job we \u2019re doing, which is to support the economy, to give the economy the support it needs.  There are people out there who\u2019 ve lost their jobs.  It\u2019s essential that we get them back to work as quickly as possible, and we want to do everything we can to do that.  And that is our primary focus right now.  It \u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s too soon to be \u2014to be worried about that.  You know, when we come to exit, we have a \u2014we have an understanding of how to do that , and we \u2019ll do it very carefully.  But in the meantime, our focus is on giving the economy the support it needs.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.   I just wanted to go back to fiscal stimulus for a second.  You know, we just had a $900 billion  package , and now Congress is talking about doing    more.  Do you expect more aid directly to consumers to be inflationary?  And , specifically, how worried should lawmakers be about, you know, causing concerning levels of inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I, I would say that , again, we have been struggling with disinflationary forces for some time.  If you look around the world\u2014look in Western Europe, look at Japan\u2014around the world, large economies have , have  felt much more downward pressure on inflation, have fallen short of  their inflation goals , for some time now.  That is the broad global macroeconomic context that we all live in.  And we believe that those global forces \u2014which are, you know, aging demographics, advancing technology, and globalization\u2014those , those  forces are still in effect.  Now, they may slow down, a nd, and it \u2019s, it\u2019s an interesting question, the extent to which, for example, globalization may slow down or even reverse.  Notwithstanding that , inflation dynamics in the United States have , have  consis ted of a flat Phillips c urve and low persistence for , for a long time.  We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly.  It may evolve over time, but significant time.   You know, these things are \u2014these things are, are  changing, but they don\u2019t change at a rapid rate.  And  there\u2019s \u2014I, I don\u2019t believe that , that  they will.  So I wouldn\u2019t \u2014I\u2019m, I\u2019m not \u2014I\u2019m  much more worried about falling short of a complete recovery and losing people \u2019s careers and lives that they \u2014that they  built because they don \u2019t get to work \u2014back to work in time and things like that.  I\u2019m more concerned about that and the damage that will do not just to their lives, but to the United States economy, to the productive capacity of the economy.  I \u2019m more concern ed about that than about the possibility, which exists , of higher inflation.  Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation.  The kind of troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems , seems  far away and unlikely in, in  the both domestic and global context that we \u2019ve been in for some time.   \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellen, in a memo to her employees yesterday, spoke of  the close working re lationship with the Federal Reserve.  And I \u2019m wondering how you would describe the relationship with , with  Treasury under Chair Yellen , if you\u2019ve met with, with , with Treasury Secretary Yellen and, and/or President Biden since he has taken office . And, you know, secondly, about that, as you know, in the last four years, there  was constant criticism from the \u2014of the F ed from the P resident and from other officials of the Administration.  Do you have any kind of assurance or expectation that this will now b e more of a hands -off attitude , in terms of commenting on monetary policy from the A dministration?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Okay .  So I have the highest respect and admiration for Secretary Yellen.  And I \u2019m, I\u2019m sure that we \u2019re going to have a , a good working relati onship together.  Absolutely sure.  We \u2019ll also have a good institut ional relationship between the F ed and the Treasury.  And I expect that that \u2019ll be very good and, and very productive.  It\u2019ll be collaborative .  We\u2019ll work together.  Now, the way that works is , is that, you know, we know \u2014the agencies know each other well, and this is true of finance ministries and central banks around the world.  We know to stay in our lanes.  We know we have different authorities.  We know that we work together on some  things to \u2014you know, for the benefit of the public.  And I \u2019m, I\u2019m  absolutely sure that we \u2019re going to do that.  I, you know, haven\u2019 t\u2014I haven\u2019t  spoken to, to Secretary Yellen \u2014I\u2019m going to be calling her \u201c Chair Yellen \u201d most of the time, so you just have to be  patient with me \u2014Secretary Yellen .  I haven\u2019 t spoken to her since I congratulated her on being nominated.  I do expect very soon to    begin our regular calls or \u2014and, and ultimately meetings , which have gone on, really , for, you know, 70 years.  T he Treasury Secretary and the, and the  Fed Chair have had weekly or so meetings, lunches, breakfast, calls, depending on the situation.  So I expect that will \u2014that will happen soon. I\u2019ve\u2014I have not met the , the President, President Biden.  And just , you know, I , I, I don\u2019 t\u2014I don\u2019t  have any comment on your \u2014on your last question.  I wouldn\u2019 t want to comment one way or the other.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ust to  follow up brief ly, you have some 13(3)  emergency programs that  will expire March  31 that the F ed and the Treasury have worked on together.  Do you have an expectation of whether those will be left , left to expire then or whether they will be extended?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I \u2014I\u2019ll just say that I think our facilities were very successful in supporting the economy during its darkest moments and I believe saved \u2014protected the loss of millions of jobs.  We\u2019 re going to continue to monitor financial and credit conditions throughout the economy.  And , and if the kind of emergency conditions arise that are required under that law, then our emergency lending tools will remain available.  Now, I \u2019ve had no discussions with anybody at Treasury on that, because I haven\u2019 t had any discussions with anybody at Treasury other than meet \u2014you know, high- level meetings with the\u2014with the  transition team a month or so ago.  And once we start having those , those  meetings, of course, I \u2019ll observe, you know, the long- standing practice of not talking about confidential discussions.  But as of now, there haven\u2019 t been any discussions at all.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this.  So a couple questions on timing.  In the statement , you removed\u2014regarding the c oronavirus \u2014you removed the time reference \u201cshort and medium term \u201d when it comes to the risks to the economic outlook , and it simply now says \u201cconsiderable risks to the economic outlook. \u201d  Should we read that as a sort of a positive change that you , you now see an end\u2014sort of the endgame of this down the road?  Or is it more that you \u2019re, you\u2019re  worried it could last longer than you expect?  And a related issue , have you given any guidance yet to the F ed staff or S ystem on whe n the F ed itself might resume in-person event s\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  So in the statement, on the language, we dropped \u201c in the medium term, \u201d because , really, the risks are, are  in the near term, frankly.   You know, a s I mentioned, it \u2019s the rollout of the vaccine.  It \u2019s the arrival of new strains that, that  are more contagious and perhaps more virulent.  And those are the \u2014those are the \u2014and also just the ongoing\u2014third thing, of course, is the ongoing spread of the virus.  It \u2019s, it\u2019s in the near term .  It\u2019s not in the medium term.  We were thinking \u2014when we were thinking \u201c medium term, \u201d we were thinking of longer -term scarring and things like that.  Nonetheless, I mean, I think what \u2014to go to your , your  second question, and as I mentioned in my, in my  opening r emarks \u2014there is good evidence to, to support a stronger economy i n the second half of this year.  In fact, if you look at , at\u2014as we do \u2014look at a range of private forecasters, what was their forecast in , in December , and what \u2019s their forecast now?  Right ac ross the board :  much higher forecast s for 2021 growth.  And that \u2019s because of the ongoing rollout of the vaccines and also because of fiscal policy, expectations , and the reality of , of the CRR A Act [ Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] getting done .  So there  is\u2014there  is a positive case there.     But that \u2014think of that as \u2014the sort of base case is, is  a strong economy in the second half of the year.  The language says that there\u2019 s still \u2014I forget the exact language \u2014downside risks .  We used an adjective.  It was \u201c considerable\u201d \u2014\u201cconsiderable risk s to the economic outlook.\u201d   So there are considerable risk s, risks to the economic outlook.  Nonetheless, that is \u2014that is  a more positive outlook.  And that \u2019s really how , how  I would\u2014I would parse that for you.  I don\u2019 t know when we \u2019re going to come back to work, and I \u2019m, I\u2019m  actually in the Eccles Building here today.  And I don\u2019 t know when that \u2019ll be.  I mean, we\u2014I can \u2019t wait to be working in person again.  But , you know, we \u2014we \u2019ve been able to work successfully remotely.  We really have .  And, you know, we \u2019re not going to push people when they\u2019 re uncomfortable.  We\u2019 re going to wait til l peopl e are comfortable and wait til l it\u2019s well and truly time to get back together in person.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  The Fed in December eased its restrictions on bank dividend payments and share repurchases.  And so I wanted to ask what factors the F ed will be looking at to determine what level banks can pay out in the second quarter and when we can expect such a decision\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Okay .  So we \u2019re, we\u2019re  monitoring that on an ongoing basis, continue to \u2014continuing to evaluate our , our restrictions .  And we haven\u2019 t made a decision about whether to continue them in the second quarter or not.  We \u2019re just going to look at ba nk\u2014w e\u2019re going to look at the whole range of , of information , including economic activity, banking activity, the , the success in vaccination.  All of those things will go into our assessment of what the right answer is to that question.     I think we \u2019ve been careful about , about  rolling back those restrictions.  And, and I \u2019m pleased with where we are.  L et\u2019s remember that the banks \u2014that the banks that are subject to the stress tests have taken very, very large reserves\u2014 very large loss reserves, and also increa sed their capital .  They\u2019ve actually had\u2014 they have higher capital ratios now than they had at the beginning of the pandemic.  So the banking system has held up well here.  And, and\u2014but , you know, we \u2019re going to be careful about this and, you know, move based on data , and all of the data, when we make that decision.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, thank you for taking the question.  So I \u2019m interested in the  housing sector.  Home prices are rising , 9 percent  in some areas, because of low interest rates.  Are you concerned about a bubble forming there yet?  And is there a price increase, you know, that you\u2019 re looking at where it might change the level of mortgage -backed securities the Fed  is buying?  And , as a continuation of that, is the bubble in the corporate debt cycle more concerning for you?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , on housing, you know, housing is now \u2014the level of housing activity is at its highest level since  before the Global F inancial C risis, in some measures .  So we\u2019ve had a very strong rebound in housing.  Some of the , the tightness in housing markets , we think\u2014which has led to the , the significant price increases this year \u2014we think is , is a passing phenomenon.  There was a lot of pent -up demand. There \u2019s a one- time thing happening with people who are spending all of their time in their house, and they\u2019 re thinking either \u201c I need a bigger house \u201d or \u201cI need another house and a different house \u2014or a second house ,\u201d in some cases.  So there \u2019s just\u2014there\u2019s  a\u2014there\u2019s a one -time shift in demand that we think will get satisfied \u2014also , that will call for th supply.  And that    will\u2014that will, we think \u2014we  think that those price increases are unlikely to be sustained for , for all of those reasons.  So you asked about corporate debt, I guess ?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Yes.  I\u2019m just concerned if that \u2019s a bubble that you\u2019 re watching.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we , we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty carefully.  And , you know, what \u2019s happened in, in  the corporate debt market , beginning with the announcement of our corporate credit facility, has been , you\u2019 ve seen lenders lending and borrowers borrowing.  You\u2019ve seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we\u2014than we  expected.  There were a lot of downgrades and some defaults at the beginning , and those have really slowed down. And, by the way, the same is true for bank loans.  Banks are no t experiencing the kinds of defaults that , that  we all were concerned about in the early months of the pandemic.  It \u2019s just not materializing.  So they\u2019 re having to reverse some of their loss reserves, actually.  Debts \u2014corporate debt spreads are, are  tight.   They \u2019ve tightened.  They were very broad\u2014high \u2014wide, of course, at the \u2014during the acute phase of the pandemic , and they\u2019ve \u2014you know, they\u2019 re now at the lower end of their typical range.  And we do monitor that.  You know, it \u2019s, it\u2019s not something we can control or operate on directly, but we do\u2014we do watch those things.  And, you know, in a sense, it \u2019s good that companies have been able to finance themselves during this period, because they\u2014they\u2019 ve been able to stay in business .  They\u2019ve been able to keep their employees working.  And , you know, that \u2019s a good thing.  And that\u2019s, that\u2019s  part of highly accommodative financial conditions.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks.  Can you\u2014s ince you suggested that the concern from th e pandemic is perhaps a shorter -term concern and that \u2019s why you removed some of the language from the statement, can you talk about what kind of impact you \u2019re seeing so far?  Do you feel that structural impacts have been \u2014ho w would you characterize those?  I know that \u2019s been a major concern \u2014you\u2019ve talked about at this press conference and others.  Do we see longer -term damage to the job market?  Have\u2014or has there been some success in preventing that?  And , compared to previous recessions, how would you characterize the damage to the job market here , in terms of things like, you know, permanent job loss, workers that need to shift industries, that kind o f thing?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, the , the, the big thing is that the jury \u2019s out.  And this has been a concern since the very beginning, is the concern that people \u2014if, if they become disconnected from the industry or the job where \u2014that they used to work in, it, it can be years or never when they get back into the labor force, particularly for people who are well along in their careers\u2014t he same kind of scarring for small businesses, which don\u2019 t have the kind of resources that you need to get through this.  S o we \u2019ve, we\u2019ve  had a big concern about , about  both of those.  We haven \u2019t seen as much of it as we\u2014as we feared.  And that \u2019s a good thing.  But as I said that, you know, the jury is out here \u20149 or 10  million people still out of work because of the pandemic.  They\u2019re \u2014a big chunk of them are people who worked in public -facing jobs in the service sector.  And, you know, they\u2019 ve gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from monetary policy.  But the question is getting them back to work.  And, you know, it \u2019s, it\u2019s harder  if you\u2019re \u2014it takes longer , empirically , to find that next job if you\u2019 re looking at a brand- new industry.  It\u2019s not easy to change careers completely midcareer.  So that just, again, stresses the    urgency that we feel and others feel at,  at, you know, fully defeating the pandemic, finishing the job a nd getting back to a place where it \u2019s safe to have these\u2014 you know, to, to , to stay in hotels, to fly on airplanes, to go to sporting events and movie theaters, and all of those things. So those people are still at risk.  And we \u2019re, we\u2019re  very, very focused on that group of people with our policy a nd, and, and, you know, the way we look at the economy.  So many people have had that brid ge across the pandemic.  You know, we talked about that at the beginning.  For many people, it \u2019s clear that they \u2019ve made it across, a nd their job  is okay , and their house  is okay.  And, you know, it \u2019s been terribly inconvenient and painful, and schools are closed and things like that.  But there, there \u2019s a bunch of people yet who haven\u2019 t found that bridge yet.  And we \u2019re, we\u2019re  very focused on that.  Of course, the other thing is, we \u2019re going to a diff erent economy.  And we \u2019re going to be learning more about that as we go.  But , clearly, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  learning that things can be done from remote locations.  We\u2019re learning that technology can replace people even more than we thought.  And some of that is happening. So I think as we, you know , as we get into this, you know, the phase after \u2014even after the economy fully reopens, I think we \u2019re still going to need to keep people in mind whose lives have been disrupted, because they \u2019ve lost that \u2014the work that th ey did.  And I think it would be wise as a country, for the longer -run productive capacity of the country, if we were to look out for those people and help them find their way back into the labor force even if it means continuing support for an additional period of time.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Great.  If I could as k this  quick follow \u2014yesterday Susan Rice, domestic policy advisor at the White House, talked about a Citigroup study that said closing racial economic gaps could add up to $5 trillion to the  U.S. economy over the next five    years and 6  million new jobs.  Do you agree that racial disparities are currently a drag on the economy?  And, if so, what can the Fed  do proactively to narrow those racial gaps in income and wealth, including potentially through regulatory policy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I strongly agree  with that, as a matter of fact.   I think if you look at either\u2014look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps, wealth gaps, homeowning gaps, all of those persistent gaps that exist even control ling for many other factors, you will see that they \u2019re, they\u2019re  persistent , they\u2019re \u2014and they \u2019re very difficult to explain.  And so it\u2019s \u2014the reason we talk about inequality and, and racial inequality in particular, is that it goes to our job, which is to achieve maximum employment, which, which links up with , with\u2014we want \u2014we want  the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can possibly be.  We want \u2014we want  an economy where everybody can take part a nd everybody, everybody can put their labor in, and they can share in the prosperity of our great economy.  That\u2019s what we want.  And that \u2019s how the U .S. economy can be bigger, stronger, growing faster, is if we can achieve a more \u2014a broader prosperity. So, now , in terms of our tools, you know, of course, that project that I just mentioned is one for the broader society, for the private sector, for fiscal policy, but we have a role to play.  And, and that is , how we think about the labor market.  Principally , whe n we say that the maximum employment is a , a broad and inclusive goal, what we \u2019re\u2014what we\u2019re  saying there is , we\u2019re not just going to look at the headline \u2014and we never did, really, b ut\u2014we \u2019re not going to just look at the headline numbers.  We\u2019re going to l ook at different demographic groups, including women, minorities , and others.  And we \u2019re not going to say that we \u2019ve reached maximum  employment, which is our statutory goal, until we \u2019ve reached maximum  employment.     And you haven\u2019t  if, if there \u2019s lots of po ckets of , of people not participating in or not employed in the labor market.  S o those are the things that we can do.  We also do a tremendous amount of research on these issues.  You know, we  do\u2014we, we  have such a focus on these issues now that we actuall y\u2014we , we have a new , a webpage, relatively new, where you can access all of it.  But it \u2019s a lot of activities in our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs.  It\u2019s lots of research , and, and it \u2019s also, you know, our enforcement of the fair lending laws and things like that.  So I think everybody\u2019 s got a role to play here.  It \u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s  a national goal and a national job, a nd we \u2019re just going to do our part of the job.  And it \u2019s something we \u2019re strongly committed to.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  You said in your opening remarks that the , the economy in many ways had proven more resilient than, than  people  expected , and that that reflected the adaptability of both households and businesses.  Are, are there adaptations that caught you by surprise, maybe related to remote work or new ways to do on- site work, in- person, face-to-face work that , that  the economy\u2019 s proven tougher than, than you expected at the outset of this pandemic?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: .  Well, yes.  S o I think, if you go back to the \u2014to the beginning, there was a real concern.  I mean, just , just  take the financial markets, for example.  Suddenly, all of those big buildings all over the , the\u2014New York City and all around the world where people work in the financial markets with terminals and everything , everybody had to go home, and they had to take their terminals with them.  And I think there was a real concern that there would be a tremendous loss of functionality just at the time when the financial markets were under    historically difficult conditions.  And yet, it worked out okay.  So I think pe ople\u2014many people in the financial sector are still working with their terminals at home, including people on trading floors or on virtual trading floors.  Now, some of that \u2019s reversing now.  But we have definitely learned that we can do more work from home in many, many different lines of work.  Of course, that \u2019s not possible if your job involves being at a place, doing personal services.  For many people, it \u2019s not possible.  And that\u2019s very much something that skews to higher -income, higher -educated people being able to work from home and others not so much.  So I think we \u2019ve learned that.  The other thing, though, even conditional on that, when we saw  the wave in the S outh and the W est, the wave of cases this summer, I think , intuitively , having seen what happened in March and April, we expected there to be a significant hit to economic activity.  And people kind of just got on with their lives and went and , and dealt with it.  And , and it didn\u2019 t actually \u2014it had a much smaller effect on ec onomic activity than we expected.  Then comes the fall wave, which is just so much larger \u2014a very, very large wave as , as was very much forecast.  People going indoors, the cold weather, all of that.  And even there, if you look at \u2014I would say, look at the December jobs report.  So , big job losses in, you know, in that part of the service sector.  So I mentioned 400,000 jobs in bars and restaurants .  There\u2019s  another 100,000 in similar kinds of activities.  But if you go \u2014if you look elsewhere, it \u2019s not having an effect.  You know, even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on, on areas of the economy that are not directly \u2014really directly \u2014exposed to the pandemic in their economic activity, t hey\u2019re doing okay.  T hey are.  Housing is a great example.  You know, the way\u2014the way \u2014the way  the housing industry worked, that when you buy a house, there was a lot of in- person contact .  They managed    to pretty much immediately go to a more virtual \u2014you know, with all the technology.  They were able to completely a void that.  And the housing market has been really strong, notwithstanding that it\u2019 s, it\u2019s now quite virtual rather than in person. So there \u2019s been a lot of adapting, and\u2014but you can\u2019 t adapt, you know, hotels, sporting venues, movie theaters, restaurants, bars .  You just \u2014you know, those are just going to \u2014and that\u2019s\u2014again , that\u2019s millions and millions of people.  And so you\u2019 re just going to have to defeat the pandemic, which, as I mentioned, you know, we , we have a plan to do that, but we haven\u2019 t done it yet . And we need to\u2014we need to  finish the job.  And we \u2014it\u2019 s, it\u2019s within our power to do that as a country this year.

Interest rates will stay near zero and asset purchases will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete, but the path of the economy depends on the course of the virus, which has caused hardship and weighed on economic activity.The housing sector has fully recovered, supported by low mortgage rates, while business investment and manufacturing production have also improved. The overall economic recovery is partly due to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, but the path ahead remains uncertain as economic activity and the labor market have slowed, with significant job losses in industries affected by the resurgence of the virus. The unemployment rate remains elevated, and millions of Americans are still unemployed.The economic downturn has disproportionately affected the most vulnerable Americans, particularly lower-wage workers in the service sector and minority groups. The pandemic has also impacted inflation, with consumer prices stabilizing after a significant decline in the spring. Despite the challenges, there are signs of an improved outlook later this year, but widespread vaccinations and adherence to safety measures are necessary to return to normal economic activities.The FOMC reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the economy through fiscal policy, monetary policy, and maintaining an accommodative stance until maximum employment and inflation goals are achieved. They also plan to continue increasing their holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities until substantial progress is made.The increase in the balance sheet has supported the economy and eased financial conditions. It will take time to achieve substantial progress towards employment and inflation goals, but our guidance ensures accommodative monetary policy.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expresses its commitment to utilizing all available tools to bolster the economy and ensure a strong recovery from the current challenging period. The committee concludes its statement by expressing gratitude and anticipation for any questions.", "question_answer_summary": ["QUESTION: What is the Federal Reserve's plan if there is a large financial stability risk from the nonbank financial sector in the coming months?\n\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve relies on macroprudential policy tools such as stress tests, liquidity and capital requirements, and resolution planning for banks. For the nonbank sector, they monitor financial conditions broadly and coordinate with other agencies through the Financial Stability Oversight Council. They are currently examining and considering how to address potential issues in the nonbank sector in the near future.", "'QUESTION': Do you believe the economy still needs additional support on the fiscal side? And in what areas?\n'ANSWER': The fiscal response to the downturn has been strong and sustained, contributing to the strong recovery. However, there are still 9 million unemployed people and many small businesses under pressure. The decision on how much to spend and in what way is for Congress and the Administration, not the Fed.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve address concerns that easy monetary policy is fueling a potential bubble in various assets, such as Bitcoin, corporate bonds, and the stock market?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve's response to the unprecedented shock of the pandemic was aimed at restoring market function, providing relief, and supporting the recovery. With millions of jobs still lost and unemployment rates high, accommodative monetary policy is necessary to support maximum employment and price stability. The Fed monitors various factors, including asset prices, leverage in the banking and nonbanking sectors, and funding risk, to ensure overall financial stability. The recent rise in asset values is driven by expectations about vaccines and fiscal policy, rather than solely by monetary policy. The connection between low interest rates and asset values is not as tight as commonly believed.", "'QUESTION': Do you rule out or see as one of your tools in the toolkit the idea of adjusting monetary policy to address asset values?\n'ANSWER': We don't rule it out as a theoretical matter, but we primarily rely on macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, and other kinds of tools to address financial stability issues. Monetary policy is focused on strengthening economic activity and job creation, which in turn supports financial stability. The tradeoff between raising interest rates to address asset bubbles is unresolved and not something we plan to do.", "QUESTION: How will the Fed determine if a rise in inflation is temporary or enduring, and how much inflation is the Fed willing to tolerate before taking action?\n\nANSWER: The Fed expects temporary inflation due to base effects and a burst of spending as the economy reopens. They will be patient and not react to small and likely transient effects on inflation. If sustained inflation becomes uncomfortable, the Fed has tools to address it, but they do not expect that to happen. They aim to see inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time and will use judgment rather than a formula to set policy.", "'QUESTION': How are the rollout of vaccines and funding for distribution being factored into the forecasts and what is the timeline? Have FOMC members been vaccinated?\n'ANSWER': The rollout of vaccines is being closely monitored, but it is expected to take a while to reach the numbers needed for herd immunity. The slow rollout and the emergence of new virus strains pose downside risks to the economy. The FOMC sets policies based on a range of possibilities and remains accommodative until there is actual improvement in the economy. Getting people vaccinated is crucial for economic recovery. The Chair has received the first dose of the vaccine and expects to receive the second dose soon.", "'QUESTION': Have you discussed raising margin requirements under Regulation T?\n'ANSWER': No, we haven't. We are currently focused on maximum employment, price stability, and financial stability in the broad financial sector. While we have the authority to do so, raising margin requirements is not something we are currently considering.", "QUESTION: Is the Fed locked into a narrow corridor due to the threat of taper tantrum and the zero bound on interest rates?\n\nANSWER: The Fed believes its policy stance is appropriate and providing strong support for economic activity. They have implemented rate guidance and asset purchases that are supporting sectors like housing and durable goods. While there is more they can do, the main obstacle to economic recovery is the pandemic, not the lack of Fed support. It is premature to discuss tapering, and the Fed will communicate clearly when they see substantial progress towards their goals.", "'QUESTION': Can the Federal Reserve stop its policies when it's time?\n'ANSWER': Yes, the Federal Reserve can stop its policies when necessary. They have done it before after the Global Financial Crisis by raising interest rates, freezing and shrinking the balance sheet. They have learned from that experience and will communicate well in advance, move gradually, and be transparent. However, currently, their focus is on supporting the economy and getting people back to work.", "'QUESTION': Do you expect more aid directly to consumers to be inflationary? And, specifically, how worried should lawmakers be about causing concerning levels of inflation?\n'ANSWER': We have been struggling with disinflationary forces globally for some time. Inflation dynamics in the US have consisted of a flat Phillips curve and low persistence. We do not expect significant changes in the near term. We are more concerned about falling short of a complete recovery and the damage it will do to the economy than about the possibility of higher inflation.", "QUESTION: How would you describe the relationship with Treasury under Chair Yellen and have you met with Treasury Secretary Yellen or President Biden since he took office? Do you expect a hands-off attitude from the Administration regarding commenting on monetary policy?\n\nANSWER: I have the highest respect for Secretary Yellen and anticipate a good working relationship. The Fed and Treasury will have a productive and collaborative institutional relationship. We know our respective authorities and work together for the public's benefit. I haven't spoken to Secretary Yellen since her nomination, but expect regular calls and meetings. I haven't met President Biden and won't comment on the last question.", "'QUESTION': Do you have an expectation of whether the 13(3) emergency programs that expire on March 31 will be extended?\n'ANSWER': Our emergency lending tools will remain available if the required emergency conditions arise. I haven't had any discussions with anyone at Treasury regarding this matter, but once we start having those meetings, I will adhere to the practice of not discussing confidential discussions. As of now, there haven't been any discussions at all.", "'QUESTION': Should the removal of the time reference \"short and medium term\" in the statement regarding the risks to the economic outlook be seen as a positive change or a concern that the impact of the coronavirus could last longer than expected? Have there been any discussions about when the Fed might resume in-person events?\n'ANSWER': The removal of \"short and medium term\" was because the risks are in the near term, particularly related to the vaccine rollout, new strains, and ongoing spread of the virus. There is evidence for a stronger economy in the second half of the year due to vaccine rollout and fiscal policy. However, there are still considerable risks to the economic outlook. The timing for resuming in-person events is uncertain, but remote work has been successful and they will wait until it's safe to gather in person.", "'QUESTION': What factors will the Fed consider when determining bank dividend payments and share repurchases in the second quarter?\n'ANSWER': The Fed will evaluate a range of information, including economic and banking activity, vaccination success, and overall data. They have been cautious in rolling back restrictions and are pleased with the resilience of the banking system, but will make decisions based on careful consideration of all relevant data.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about a housing bubble forming due to rising home prices and is there a price increase that would change the level of mortgage-backed securities the Fed is buying? Is the bubble in the corporate debt cycle more concerning?\n\n'ANSWER': Housing activity is at its highest level since before the Global Financial Crisis, with significant price increases this year. The tightness in housing markets is a passing phenomenon due to pent-up demand and one-time shifts in demand. The Fed does not believe the price increases will be sustained. The question about corporate debt was not addressed.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about a bubble in the corporate debt market?\n'ANSWER': We monitor the corporate debt market closely and have seen lenders lending and borrowers borrowing. Defaults have been fewer than expected, and banks are not experiencing the defaults we were concerned about. Corporate debt spreads have tightened, which is a positive sign as companies have been able to finance themselves and stay in business during this period.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk about the impact of the pandemic on the job market, particularly in terms of longer-term damage, permanent job loss, and workers needing to shift industries?\n'ANSWER': The jury is still out on the long-term impact, but there is concern that people who become disconnected from their previous jobs may struggle to reenter the labor force, especially for those well into their careers. Small businesses also face challenges. While the damage hasn't been as severe as feared, there are still millions of people out of work, particularly in public-facing service sector jobs. It is difficult to find new jobs in different industries, emphasizing the urgency of defeating the pandemic and getting people back to work. The focus is on supporting those still at risk and helping them find their way back into the labor force, even if it requires continued support.", "QUESTION: Do you agree that racial disparities are currently a drag on the economy? And, if so, what can the Fed do proactively to narrow those racial gaps in income and wealth, including potentially through regulatory policy?\n\nANSWER: I strongly agree that racial disparities are a drag on the economy. Persistent gaps in employment, wages, wealth, and homeownership exist even when controlling for other factors. The Fed's role is to achieve maximum employment and a broader prosperity. We consider different demographic groups and aim for inclusive goals. We also conduct research, enforce fair lending laws, and have a webpage dedicated to these issues.", "'QUESTION': Are there adaptations related to remote work or new ways of working that have surprised you in terms of the economy's resilience during the pandemic?\n'ANSWER': The financial sector successfully transitioned to remote work, with people still using their terminals at home. We have learned that many different lines of work can be done from home, but this is not possible for jobs that require in-person services. The pandemic has had a smaller impact on economic activity than expected, except for sectors like bars and restaurants. The housing market adapted well to virtual interactions, but industries like hotels, movie theaters, and restaurants continue to struggle. The key to economic growth is controlling the pandemic through vaccinations and safety measures."]}
