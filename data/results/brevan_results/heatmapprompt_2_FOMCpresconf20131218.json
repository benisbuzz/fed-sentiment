Ylan Mui  with  the Washington Post .  Today was the first  reduction in asset purchases , and you just said that future reductions will likely occur in measured steps , but are not on a  predetermined course.  Can you tell us any  more about the framework that you all plan  to use to determine the size and the timing of t hose reductions ?  And previously  you had said that you expect the program to end altogether by the middle of next year .  Is that still a likely scena rio\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, as I said, the steps that we take will be dat a-dependent.  If we \u2019re making progress in terms of inflation and continue d job gains \u2014and I imagine we \u2019ll continue to do, probably at  each meeting , a measured reduction\u2014t hat would take us to late in the year , certainly not by the middle of the year.  If the economy slows for some reason or we are disappointed in the outcomes, we could skip a meeting or two.  On the other side, if things really pick up, then of course we co uld go a bit faster , but my expectation is for similar moderate steps going forward throughout most of 2014\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Steve Liesman, CNBC .  Mr. Chairman, thank you.  When you say \u201csimilar moderate steps going forward, \u201d is $10 billion an increment that people should anticipate ?  And is equal amounts of mortgage -back ed securities and T reasuries also what one   should anticipate?  Finally, when you say \u201c well pas t\u201d the unemployment rate of 6\u00bd percent, why not pick a number ?  Why say \u201cwell pas t\u201d?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Sure .  On the first issue of $10 billion, again, we say we are going to  take further modest steps subsequently , so that would be the general range .  But again, I want to emphasi ze that we are going to be data- depen dent.  We could s top purchases if the economy disappoints .  We could pick them up somewhat if the economy is st ronger .1   In terms of MBS versus T reasuries, we discussed that issue.  I think that the general sense of the C ommittee was that equal reductions , or approximately equal reductions , was the simpler way to do this .  It obviously doesn\u2019 t make a great deal of difference in the end to how much we hold.  So that was going to be our strategy . On the issue  of another number, the unemployment rate \u2014let \u2019s talk first about the labor market condition.  The unemployment rate is a good indicator of  the labor market .  It\u2019s probably the best single indicator that we have .  And so we were comfortable setting a 6.5 percent unemployment rate as the point at which we would begin to look at a more broad set of labor market indicators .  However, precisely because we don\u2019 t want to look just at the unemployment rate, we want to \u2014once we get to 6\u00bd\u2014we want to look at hiring, quits, vacancies, participation, long-term unemployment, et cetera, wages .  We couldn \u2019t put it in terms of another unemployment  rate level , specifically .  So, I expect there w ill be some time pas t the 6\u00bd percent before all of the other variables that we\u2019ll be  looking at will line up in a way that will give us confidence that the labor market is strong enough to withstand the beginning of increases in rates .                                                              1 The Chairman meant to say:   \u201cWe could stop the reductions in the pace of purchases if the economy disappoints.   We could reduce the pace of purchases somewhat more quickly if the economy is stronger.\u201d    The SEP, the Survey of Economic Projections , which were distributed, obviously that \u2019s individual assessments and not the C ommittee \u2019s collective view .  But nevertheless, it gives you some sense of current expectations about the length of time .  The SEP shows that the 6.5 percent is expected by a large number of people to be reached about  at the end of next year, end of 2014.  And then the first rate increases , according t o the so- called dots c hart, take place near the end of 2015.  So that \u2019s the order of the magnitude , I think , that people are currently expecting , but again I emphasize that it will depend on our  being persuaded that \u2014over , across a  broad range of indicators \u2014the labor market is sufficiently strong that we could begin to withdraw accommodation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jo n Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman, as  you we ll know, the F ed is going through a transition next month.  Can you talk about the role that Janet Yellen played in formulating the policy that\u2019 s being laid out today , and what kind of consistency the public can expect as we go into her tenure , assuming she \u2019s confirmed , with the program that you\u2019 re laying out today ?  W ill it carry on under  her leadership?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Yes, it will.  I have always consulted closely with Janet, even well before she was named by the P resident , and I consulted closely with her on these decisions as well .  And she fully supports what we did today.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, your inflation forecasts never get back to 2 percent in the time horizon that you cover here , out to 2016.  Given t hat, why should we believe the F ed has a symmetric inflation target ?  And, in particular, why should we believe you\u2019 re following an optimal policy \u2014optimal  control policy , as you\u2019ve said in the past \u2014given that that would imply inflation going a bit above target at some point ?  Thank you.  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well , again, these are individual estimates, there are big standard errors implicitly around them and so on.  We do think that inflation will grad ually move back to 2 percent , and we allow for the possibility , as you know , in our guidance that it could go as high as 2\u00bd percent .  Even though inflation has been quite low in 2013, let me give you the case for why inflation might rise .   First, there ar e some special factors , such as health -care costs and some other things , that have been unusually low and might be reversed.  Secondly, if you look at the fundamentals for inflation , incl uding inflation expectations , whether measured by financial markets o r surveys ; if you look at growth, which we now anticipate w ill be picking up bot h in the U .S. and internationally; if you look at wages , which have been growing at 2 percent and a little bit higher according to many indicators \u2014all of these things suggest that inflation will gradually pick up.   But what I tried to emphasize in my opening remarks , and which is clear in our statement , is that we take this very seriously .  It\u2019s not easy to \u2014inflation cannot be picked up and move d where you want it .  It takes \u2014it requires , obviously , some luck and some good policy .  But we are very committed to making sure that inflation does not stay too low , and we are continuing to monitor that very carefully and to take whatever actions necessary to achieve that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And on optimal control \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, even under optimal control, it would take a while for inflation \u2014inflation is quite \u2014can be quite inertial .  It can take quite a  time to move .  And the responsi veness  of inflation to increasing economic activity is quite low .  So\u2014and particularly given an environment where we have falling oil prices and other factors that are contributing downward forces on inflation, i t\u2019s difficult to get inflation to move quickly to target .  But we are,   again , committed to doing what\u2019 s necessary to get inflation back to target over the next couple of years.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Craig Torres from Bloomberg News .  There \u2019s been a great deal of discussion in your profession about the potency of  policy at the zero boundary .  And to kind of bounce off Robin, it \u2019s very striking that inflation has fallen  while QE3 has been in place , and the economy continues to undershoot the FOMC \u2019s forecast .  So, I guess the simple question is, are you giving up?  Y ou know, I mean, have you reached the limit of your policy tools , and is there nothing more you can do ?  The economy is still running way below the trend line that existed before the financial crisis.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, everything depends on what benchmark you compare it to, as you know .  I said last year that monetary  policy was not a panacea .  It couldn \u2019t solve all our problems .  And , in particular, it can \u2019t do anything about a slowing in potential growth, which appears to have happen ed, at least to some extent .  It can \u2019t do much or anything about fiscal policy , which is working in quite the opposite direction.  So, given those things, I think the outcomes we \u2019ve had are perhaps not as bad as you would\u2014might think .  In particular, as I \u2019ve mentioned many times, the Congressional Budget Office assessed the fiscal drag in 2013 as being about  1\u00bd percentage points of growth.  We \u2019re looking like we \u2019re going to get in the low 2s actual growth .  Add those numbers t ogether, it \u2019s kind of a counter factual .  It says th at monetary  policy a ppears to have succeeded in off setting a good bi t of that fiscal drag , which we were not at all sure that we could accomplish .  So, we \u2019re certainly not giving up.  We intend to maintain a highly accommodative policy .  Nothing tha t we did today was intended to reduce accommodation .  We \u2019re still going to be buying assets at a high rate and increasing and holding \u2014increasing our balance sheet and holding on to those assets .  In our guidance today \u2014  we strengthen ed our guidance to make clear that we expect to keep rates low well beyond the point that  unemployment hits 6\u00bd percent.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Peter Barnes, Fox Business, sir .  Was it a close call in the discussion today among participants and members of \u2014given all you\u2019 ve said about the outlook and your forecast, was there a lot a of debate on whether or not to go ahead and start tapering now or wait longer \u2014wait for more data?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well , certainly, it \u2019s a very \u2014it was a very important decision , and we debated it quite extensively .  That being said, the question we asked  ourselves was, did we feel comfortable that \u2014to say that we had met , or were at least  well on the way toward s meeting , the criterion we set when we began the program in September of 2012?   And that criterion , of course , was a substantial  improvement in the outlook for the labor market .  And if you look at the cumulative improvement \u2014and I mentioned some figures in my opening remarks \u2014or if you look at recent numbers , either on employ ment, unemployment.  And also in terms of growth, we \u2019re seeing encouraging numbers in terms of household spending , for example, auto purchases, fiscal drag is reduced, stronger numbers internationally .  Now, I don\u2019 t want to overstate the case.  As you look at our projections, you\u2019 ll see we only assume or project a small pickup in growth going into next year .  But there was a pretty widespread view that there was a reasonable expectation , first , that the recent gains in the labor market would continue \u2014and, remember, we \u2019re just beginning this process now, so by the time we complete this process, I think it \u2019s very likely that we \u2019ll easily pass the hurdle of a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market .  Now, it is true that while we have pass ed the\u2014or , made significant progress on the labor market and growth hurdles, there is still this question about inflation, which is a bit of a concern \u2014more than a bit of concern, as we indicated in our statement .  Our outlook   is still for inflation to go b ack to 2 percent .  I gave you some reasons why I think that will happen.

The\u2014what we\u2019 ve showed\u2014there\u2019 ve been two big changes , at least \u2014more than two, but two that I would cite at the Fed in the last few years, of course, the result , in many ways , of the crisis .  The first is  that the Fed eral Reserve has rediscovered its roots , in the sense that the F ed was created to stabilize the financial system in times of panic .

The other thing that was unique about \u2014maybe not completely unique, but largely unique about this period was that we were trying to help the economy recover from a deep recession at a time when interes t rates were almost , or essentially , zero .

If you think that , overall, this is maintaining the level of monetary accommodation steady, is that a sign that the decision to   reduce the asset purchases is relatively less about an improved outlook for the economy and perhaps more  about the concern that the asset purchases are less effective or might be f ueling bubbles ?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, as I said before, asset purchases are a supplementary tool.  Our main tool is interest rate policy .  The reason that asset pur chases are a supplementary tool is because it \u2019s a much less familiar tool.  We have less ability to calibrate how big the effects are, for example.  And it \u2019s also true that , as the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve gets large, managing that balance sheet, exiting from that balance sheet become more difficult .  And there are concerns about effects on asset prices, although, I would have to say that \u2019s another thing that future monetary economist s will want to be looking at very carefully .  So, our view was \u2014in September 2012\u2014was that we had interest rates already low, and they were expected to stay low for a good long time .  The economy, though, was faltering .  We needed an additional boost .  And so we brought in the asset purchase program again .  We put in a specific objective, which is substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market .  Our sense was once that intermediate objective was attained \u2014that is, when the economy had grown and was moving forward \u2014that , at that point , we could begin to wind down the secondary tool, the supplementary tool, and achieve essentially the same amount of accommodation using interest rates and for ward  guidance.   And so, I do want to reiterate that this is not intended to be a tightening .  We don\u2019 t think that there \u2019s an inflation problem or anything like that.  On the one hand, asset purchases are still going to be continuing , we\u2019re still going to be building our bal ance sheet .  The total amount of assets that we acquire are probably more than  was\u2014certainly more than what  was expected in September 2012 or in June 2013.  So we \u2019ll have a very substantial balance sheet , which we \u2019ll   continue to hold.  And now we \u2019ve also clarified our guidance that we will be keeping rates low well pas t unemployment of 6.5 percent .  So we \u2019re trying here to get a high level of accommodation .  It is true that the purchases are \u2014we view as supplementary to the interest rate policy .  But, again, the action today is intended to keep the level of accommodation more or less the same overall and eno ugh to push the economy forward.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Victoria McGrane, Dow Jones .  In an earlier response, you sort of laid out the argument against \u2014or sort of explain ed why the C ommittee didn \u2019t lower the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold.  Is that convers ation over ?  Have you all put off the table changing those thresholds ?  Has there been any other further discussion on perhaps adding a lower bound to the inflation target as well ?  And then, specifically on inflation, w hat tools or actions could the C ommittee take if inflation continues to run below your target or even falls further?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, I think we want to make an assessment now .  I wouldn\u2019 t expect any changes in the very near term .  We want to see how much accommodation we have and w hether it \u2019s sufficient , whether the economy is continuing to grow, a nd inflation is moving back toward  target , as we anticipate.  But there are things we can do .  We can strengthen the guidance in various ways .  And while the view of the C ommittee was that the best way forward today was in this more qualitative approach, which incorporates elements both of the unemployment th reshold and the inflation floor, t hat further strengthening would be possible , and it \u2019s something that has  certainly not been ruled out .  And , of course, asset purchases are still there to be used .  We do have tools to manage a large balance sheet .  We \u2019ve made a lot of progress on that .  So while , again, while we think that we can provide a high level of accommodation with a somewhat slo wer pace\u2014but still very high pace \u2014of asset purchases and   our interest rate policy , we do have other things we can do if we need to ramp up again.  That being said, we \u2019re hopeful that the economy will c ontinue to make progress , and that we \u2019ll begin to see the whites of the eyes of the end of the recovery and the beginning of the more normal period of economic growth\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Some members of your staff published a paper earlier this fall arguing that in times of high unemployment\u2014 and, particularly , when some of that unemployment is calcifying into disengagement \u2014there\u2019 s an argument for monetary policy to be even more aggressive .  And yet you are now announcing that you\u2019 ll do less rather than more .  The Fed has  done that twice before and both times has regretted the decision.  Ca n you talk about why you are not erring on the side of doing more?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, again , we\u2019re not doing less .  We \u2019ll see how accommodation shapes up .  But while we are slowing asset purchases a bit,  again , we expect the total balance sheet to be quite large and maintained for \u2014at a large level for a long time .  And we expect to keep rates low for a very long time.  We \u2019re providing a great deal of accommodation to the economy .  I agree with your observation, and the observation of the paper that you cited, that there is a case for being particularly aggressive, and I think we ha ve been aggressive to try to keep the economy growing , and we are seeing progress in the labor market .  So I would disput e the idea that we \u2019re not providing a lot of accommodation to the economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:   Mr. Chairman , thank you . Wyatt Andrews at CBS .  Given the billions of dollars that the Fed has put into the economy over the years, do you see a leading reason why t he economy has not created more jobs?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  So, we\u2019ve been in a \u2014it\u2019 s been about a little over four years now since the recovery began, four and a half years .  It\u2019s been a slow recovery .  There are a   number of reasons for that .  It\u2019s\u2014of course , that \u2019s something for econometricians and historians to grapple with, but there have been a number of factors which have contributed to slower growth .  They include, for example, the observation that  financial cris es tend to disrupt the economy, may a ffect innovation, new products, new f irms.  We had a big housing bust, a nd so, the construction sector, of course, has been quite depressed for a while .  We \u2019ve had continuing financial disturbances in Europe and elsewhere .  We\u2019ve had very tight , on the whole \u2014except for in 2009\u2014we had very tight fiscal policy .  People don\u2019 t appreciate how tight fiscal policy has been .  At this stage in the last recession , which wa s a much milder recession, state, local, and federal governments had hired 400,000 additional workers from the trough of the recession.  At the same point in this recovery , the change in state, local, and federal government workers is minus 600,000.  So there \u2019s about a million workers difference  in how many people are \u2014have been employed at all levels  of government .  So, fiscal policy has been tight , contractiona ry, so there have been a lot of head winds.  All that being said, we have  been disappointed in the pace of growth , and we don \u2019t fully understand why .  Some of it may just be a slower pace of underlying potential, at least temporarily .  Producti vity has been disappointing .  It may be that there \u2019s been some bad luck\u2014for example, the effects of the European crisis and the like .  But compared to other advanced industrial countries \u2014Europe, the U.K., Japan \u2014compared to other countries and advanced  industrial countries reco vering from financial crise s, the U.S. recovery has actually been better than most .  It\u2019s not been good, i t\u2019s not been satisfactory .  Obviously, we still have a labor market where it \u2019s not easy for people to find work.  A lot of young people can\u2019 t get the experience and entr \u00e9e into the labor market .  But, I think, given all of  the things that we faced , it\u2019s perhaps , at least in retrospect, not shocking that the recovery has been somewhat tepid. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.com .  You just talked a little bit about fiscal policy and now Congress has \u2014is set to pass a budget deal , and they haven \u2019t really done much to reduce the deficit .  And it looks like they \u2019re not going to do anything until after the next presidential election .  So, could you talk a little bit about that ?  You\u2019ve been pressing for a bigger deal and reducing the U.S. debt burden.  Thanks.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, as always, of course, I don \u2019t address specific fiscal actions .  I will say a couple of things about this deal .  One is that , relative to where we were in September and October, it certainly is nice that there\u2019 s been a bipartisan deal , and that it looks like it\u2019 s going to pass both hous es of Congress .  It\u2019s also, at least directionally, what I have recommended in testimony , which is that it eases a bit the fiscal restra int in the next couple of years, a  period where the economy needs help to finish the recovery .  And, in place of that , it achieves savings further out in the 10- year window .  So those things  are po sitive things .  Of course, there\u2019 s a lot more work to be done , I have no doubt about that .  But it\u2019s  certainly a better situation than we had in September and October , or in Janua ry during the fiscal cliff , for that matter .  And I think it will be good for confidence if fiscal policy and c ongressional leaders work together to \u2014even if there\u2019 s\u2014even if the outcomes are small , as this one was, it\u2019 s a good thing that they are working cooperatively and making some progress.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chairman Bernanke, Donna Borak with American Banker .  As you look back on the regulatory reform effort over the last several years \u2014the rules that have been completed , those  that have yet to be finalized \u2014what rules would you have like d to have seen tougher ?  And one s that, perhaps , you would have  liked to have  seen finished before you leave?  And as someone that ha s been a steward of the financial crisis and the reform effort, as you leave now, do you fee l that the safeguards are now in place , that the system is safer?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Yes , the system is certainly safer , and one indication of that is the amount  of capital that large banks hold.  So, for example, on the capital side, we have imposed Basel III  requirements, much tougher requirements , as you know, for the large banks , with surcharges that will be part of that process .  We\u2019ve imposed\u2014 I think one of the main innovations , which I am very pleased with , is the use of stress testing , trying to see whether banks have enough capital not only to deal with normal fluctuations, but to deal with the  very severe combination of a sharp downturn in the economy and very bad fi nancial conditions .  And I think that has been a very important test, both of banks \u2019 abilities to survive a bad situation but also their abilities to measure their risk s, which was something that was very deficient going into the crisis .  Beyond that, we \u2019re looking at a leverage ratio, of course, that we expect to complete fairly so on, the possibility of having debt required at the holding company to assist in a resolution, we \u2019re looking a t capital for \u2014to backstop firms that rely heavily on short -term wholesale funding .  So there\u2019s a much stronger capital -oriented drive at this point  to strengthen our financial system \u2014and th at\u2019s just one dimension.  A nd then there\u2019s  liquidity  and many other aspects .  I think, you know, it \u2019s not really up to me to say whether these things are tough enough or not .  I mean , you and other observers who are writing about this and thinking about this obviously will have your opinions .  But, I guess, what I would say about that is that we \u2019re not done .  We have still some important rules to complete, although all of them are well advanced .  And as we get the se rules done and implement them , I\u2019m sure they \u2019ll make a very substantial difference in the safety of the system , but whether more needs to be done \u2014I\u2019ll leave that as an open question, and I think we \u2019ll be working on this for some time\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Peter  Cook of Bloomberg Television.  Mr. Chairman, first of all, thank you for holding these news conferences .  I hope you encourage your successor to have even   more of them .  One thing I know you\u2019 re going to miss is traveling to Capitol Hill to testify , and one thing that \u2019s going to be happening next year , according to the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , is a full review of the Federal Reserve\u2014 even the Federal Reserve Act, the structure of the Fed, the mission of the Fed, and the mandate of the Fed .  And I wanted to see if you might be willing to impart some final words of wisdom to members of Congress as they consider possible legislative changes .  What , if anything , could they do to the structure of the Federal Reserve, the mandate of the F ederal Reserve\u2014the dual mandate\u2014that might help Fed policy makers in the future ?  Do you think the dual mandate still is merited ?  And just a final question for you, sir , as you get set to leave and perhaps your last news conference here \u2014you talked a little bit about your frustrations, the headwinds that you face d through the course of your eight years .  Is there a decision \u2014with the benefit of hindsight \u2014that you would do differently, one change perhaps in a decision making process that you\u2019 ve made, your fell ow colleagues have made here, that you think would have made a difference mater ially over the last eight years?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, on the centennial review, let me just say , first, that  one of the things that I \u2019m proud of , and I \u2019ve tried to accomplish over the past eight years , is to increase the transparency of the Fed and to increase the accountability of the Fed .  You mentioned those trips to Capitol Hill.  I \u2019ve testified many times , as have a number of my colleagues .   There is this notion that  the Fed is not audited or i t has all kinds of secret books \u2014all these things .  As you well know, we have complete openness to the General Accountability Office, the GAO \u2014Government Accountability Office .  We have an IG, Inspector Ge neral , of our own.  We have a private accounting firm that does all the books as well under very tough standards .  We publish regular reports on all aspects of our operations .  So we \u2019re very open , and   we are by all means willing to work with Congress to se e if there \u2019s anything that they think might be done better or in a more effective way .  So, we\u2019re open to doing that .   I hope that those reviewing the central b ank will, of course, recognize that central banking is an old activity .  The 17th century is when the Swedish Riksbank and the Bank of England began operation, so we know a lot about central banking .  There are a lot of experts on central banking, a lot of experts on monetary policy .  Every major country has a central bank .  So we\u2019re not starting from scratch .  I mean , there  are a lot of people with a lot of expertise on this , and I hope that , as we talk about these issues , that we are bringing in serious people who understand these issues and who can make good suggestions .   Now, there are a range of different mandates around the world .  There are some single mandates , there are some dual mandates, et cetera.  It\u2019s our sense that the dual mandate has served us well here\u2014in particular , that the Fed has been able, at times , to spe ed the recovery from recession and help put people back to work more quickly .  Of course, we can \u2019t do anything about long -run employment opportunities , but we can help the economy recover more quickly .  So I think that that \u2019s valuable.  I would note, by the way, that at the current moment, it doesn \u2019t really matter whether we have one mandate or two , because we\u2019 re below our inflation target and we\u2014unemployment is above where we \u2019d like it to be .  So both sides of our mandate are pointing exactly in the same direction , which is to provide strong accommodation to the economy to help it recover .   Looking in retrospect , I\u2014you know, that \u2019s a very hard question.  Every decision you make, of course , is done in real time , with deficient information and whatever you know at the time and whatever the experts are telling you about any particular issue.  Obviously, we were slow to recognize the crisis .  I was slow to recognize the crisis .  In retrospect, it was a traditional   classic crisis, but in a very, very different  guise:  different types of financial instruments, different types o f institutions, which made it , for a historian like me , more difficult to see .  Whether or not we could have prevented or done more about it, that \u2019s another question.  You know, by the time I became C hairman , it was already 2006 , and house prices were already declining .  Most of the mortgages had  been made, but , obviously, it would have been good to have recognized that earlier and try to take more preventive action .  That being said, we \u2019ve done everything we can think of , essentially , to strengthen the Fed \u2019s ability to monitor the financial markets, to take actions to stabilize the econ omy and the financial system .  So, I think, going forward, we \u2019re much better prepared for \u2014to deal with these kinds of events than we were when I became C hairman in 2006\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman .

And then the broader question\u2014 your pred ecessor, Dr. Greenspan, in his new book ar gues that long -term investment\u2014one of the reasons we may be seeing such a slow economy is that people are afraid debt and deficits are reducing long -term investment .  People are \u2014companies are investing in the sorts  of things that make them leaner, get by with fewer people , but the kind of expansion, we \u2019re not seeing .

But I think for the immediate future, my wife and I, I believe , will stay in Washington for a bit of time .   About investment, I think there are a lot of reasons why investment is weaker than we would like .  I think the first and most important reason is , the recovery is slow .  I mean, investment is driven by sales, by the need for capac ity.  And, you know, with a slow -growing GDP, slow- growing economy , most firms do not yet feel that much pressure on their capac ity to do major, new projects .  There\u2019 s also a var iety of uncertainties out there \u2014fis cal, regulatory, tax , and so on\u2014that no doubt affect  some of these calculations .  We hear that from our FOMC participants around the table as they report from their local D istricts .  So I think there are a lot of factors.  Usually, you think that the way that a deficit or a long -term debt would affect investment would be through what \u2019s called \u201ccrowding out \u201d\u2014that is,  raising interest rates .  But high interest rates \u2014we may have many problems , but high interest rat es is not our problem right now .  There\u2019 s plenty of \u2014particularly for larger firms \u2014there\u2019 s plenty of credit available at low interest rates .  And we intend, of course, to try to continue to provide that to help the economy grow and to stimulate investment spending .  But I think that  it\u2019s going to take faster overall growth to get firms trying to expand capacity , and I think if we \u2014if consumer spending increases , as we think it   will, and if exports increase, as they seem to be doing, then we \u2019ll probably see greater investment as well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Steve Beckner of MNI .  Mr. Chairman, it \u2019s been a pleasure covering you.  One of the factors that your policy statement says will be considered in assessing the future pace of asset purchases is the cost and efficacy of those purchases .  To what extent has the\u2014or y ou might say , cost and benefits \u2014to what extent has t hat calculation already changed ?  To what extent did that affect today \u2019s decision ?  And, going forward , looking on the cost side, somebody else mentioned bubbles .  Not just bubbles , but to what extent will, you know, the whole consideration of threats to financial stability come into play , as well as the potential for losses on the Fed\u2019 s own portfolio \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  So I will answer your question, and I\u2019ll try and help maybe do a better job on Binya \u2019s question as well .  We do think, again , of the asset purchases as a secondary tool behind interest rate policy , and we do think that the cost \u2013benefit ratio , particularly as the assets on the balance sheet get large, that it moves in a way that\u2019 s less favorable.  The costs involved include, you know, managing the exi t from that.  The possible \u2014it\u2019 s very unlikely that the Fed will have losses in any comprehensive sense.  We \u2019ve already put $350 billion of profits back to the T reasury since 2009, which is about as much as we delivered to the T reasury between 1990 and 2007 combined.  So, over any period of time, clearly , the Fed is actually making a good bit of money for the taxpayer and for the government .  But it could be  that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the T reasury for a couple of years , and that would create problems , no doubt , for the Fed in terms of c ongressional response .     There are issues  of how well we understand and can manage the effects of asset purchases .  I think, for example, that an important difference between asset purchases and interest rate policy is that asset purchases work by affecting what is called the  \u201cterm premium,\u201d  whic h is essentially the additional part of the interest rate which investors require as compensation for holding longer -term securities .  We just don\u2019 t understand very well \u2014and  when  I say \u201c we,\u201d I mean the economic s profession\u2014don\u2019 t understand very well what m oves t he term premium .  And so, we sa w last summer \u2014we saw a very big jump in the term premium that was very destabilizing and created a lot of stress in financial markets .  So there are a number of reasons why asset purchases, while effective, while I thin k they have been important, are less attractive tools than traditional interest rate policy , and that \u2019s the reason why we have relied primarily on interest rates , but used asset purchases as a supplement when we\u2019 ve needed it to keep forward progress .   I think that, you know, obviously there are some financial stability issues involved there .  We look at the possibility that asset purchases have led to bubbly pricing in certain markets or in excessive leverage or excessive risk -taking .  We don\u2019 t think t hat that \u2019s happened to an extent  which is a danger to the system , except other than that when those positions unwind, like we saw over the summer, they can create some bumpiness in interest rate markets , in particular .  Our general philosophy on financial s tability issues is , where we can,  that we try to address it first and foremost by making sure that the banking system and the financial s ystem are as strong as possible \u2014if banks have a lot of capital , they can withstand losses , for example\u2014a nd by using whatev er other tools we have to try to avoid bubbles or other kinds of financial risks .  That being said, I don \u2019t think that you can completely ignore financial stability concerns in monetary policy because we can \u2019t control them perfectly , and there may be situa tions when financial instability   has implications for our mandate, which is jobs and inflation, which we saw , of co urse, in the Great Recession .  So it\u2019s a very complex issue.   I think it will be many years before central banks have completely worked out exactly how best to deal with financial instability questions .  Certainly, the first line of defense for us is regulatory and other types of measures , but we do have to pay some attention to that .  I would say at this point , though, that the asset purchases program \u2014the last one \u2014is well on its way to meeting our economic objective , and I am very pleased that we \u2019re able to , over time , wind down this program, slowing the pace of purchases on current plans , because we reached our objecti ve rather than because the costs or efficacy issues became important .  So I think that , in this case , that that \u2019s not a concern at this juncture with respect to this program.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Annalyn Kurtz with CNN .  I recall in Jackson Hole  last year, you cited  a study that said the first $2 trillion in  asset purchases had boost ed GDP by about 3 percent and increased private -sector employment by 2 million jobs .  Now your balance sheet is nearin g $4 trillion, and I \u2019m wondering , do you feel the third round of  asset purchases pack ed as much bang for your buck?  And do you still think the first study offered a reasonable estimate?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, it\u2019 s very hard to know \u2014in terms of the study, it \u2019s very hard to know .  It\u2019s an imprecise science to try to measure these effects .  You have to obviously ask yourself, you know, what would have happen ed in the absence of the policy ?  I think that study \u2014I think it was a very interesting study , but it was on the upper end of the estimates that people have gotten i n a variety of studies looking at the effects of asset purchases .  That being said, I \u2019m pretty comfortable with the idea that this prog ram did , in fact , create jobs .  I cited some figures .  To repeat one of them, t he Blue Chip forecast s for unemployment in this current quarter \u2014made before we beg an our program \u2014were on the order 7.8 percent , and that   was before th e fiscal cliff deal, which even \u2014created even more fiscal headwinds for the economy .  And , of course, we \u2019re now at 7 percent .  I\u2019m not saying that the asset purchases made all that difference, but it made some of the difference , and I think it has helped create jobs .   And you can see how it works .  I mean , the asset purchases brought down long -term interest rates, brought down mortgage rates, brought down corporate bond yields , brought down car loan interest rates, and we\u2019 ve seen the response in those areas as the economy has done better .  Moreover , again, this has  been done in the face of very tight, unusually tight fiscal policy for a recovery period.  So  I do think it \u2019s been effective, but the precise size of the impact is something I think that we can very reasonably disagree about , and that work will co ntinue on.  As I said before, the uncertainty about the impact and the uncertainty about the effects of ending programs and so on is one of the reasons why we have treated this as a supplementary tool rather than as our  primary tool.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Don Lee, L.A. Times .  Unemployment benefits , as you know , are expiring  shortly for more than a million people , and many more people will see their benefits e nd next year.  How much of an economic impact do you see that ha ving?  And , secondly, what effect would you exp ect that will have on the unemployment rate ?  Could it \u2014if those people drop out of the labor force, then could that knock the employment rate down quite a bit?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Yes .  Well, obviously it has a big economic effect on those directly affected, you know, who a re receiving benefits , and we do have an unusually large number of long -term unemployed people in the United States now, which is obviously a major concern and one that I c ited in my opening remarks .  The effects of ending extended unemployment benefits , quantitatively , for the economy overall , are probably not very large because they work in two directions .  On the one hand, by putting the benefits into the system,   you are providing additiona l income .  That income is spent .  People receiving unemployment benefits obviously tend to spend a very high fraction of their income .  That is a positive fo r growth .  On the other side, it \u2014probably some folks who are\u2014 can no longer qualify for unemployment benefits will just drop out of the labor  force, and that will bring the unemployment rate down , but, for some sense , the wrong reason.  So, overall , it will have \u2014it could have a very small effect on the measured unemployment rate.  But, again , I think that issue needs to be discussed more in ter ms of the impact on those most directly affected rather than on the overall economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Kate Davidson from Politico .  This is a bit of a follow -up to an earlier q uestion .  You talked about this centennial  review of the Fed that the House is undertaking .  And the Fed, of course , has been under a lot of scrutiny , and you spoke recently about the importance of the Fed sta nding up to political pressure .  So I just wondere d what advice you have , or what advice you\u2019ve already given , to Janet Yellen when it comes to dealing with Congress \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Excellent question.  Well, I think the first thing to agree to is that Congress is our boss .  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency within the governme nt.  It\u2019s important that we maintain our policy independence in order to be able to make decisions without short -term political interference .  At the same time, it\u2019 s up to the Congress to set our structure , to set our mandate , and that \u2019s entirely legitimate , and we need to go and explain ourselves .  We need to explain why certain approaches are not so good or might be better .  But, obviously, they represent the public , and they certainly have every right to set the terms on which the Federal Reserve operates and so on.     That being said, I think that we are , in fact , an effective central bank , that we are near the frontier in terms of transparency, in terms of the effectiveness of our policies .  We \u2019re highly respected among central bankers and other p olicymakers around the world.  And so, I hope that when they do review the Fed, if that \u2019s what they do, again, that they rely on expertise and highly qualified individuals who know the ins and outs of central banking and monetary policy, which are not simp le matters .  And it would be very interesting to have a thorough discussion of many of the issues involved that the Fed has  been engaged in .  But , again, I hope it will be  on a high level that uses  the best and most qualified people debating, you know, wha t changes , if any , are needed and \u2014or, you know, what \u2019s being done right\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Murre y Jacobson with t he NewsHour .  On t he question of longer -term unemployment and the drop in labor force participation, how much do you see that as the result of structural changes  going on in the economy at this point ?  And to what extent do you think government can help alleviate that in this environment?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  .  I think a lot of the declines in the participation rate are , in fact, demograph ic or structural , reflecting sociological trends .  Many of the changes that we\u2019 re seeing now, we were also seeing to some degree even before the crisis, and we have a number of staffers here at the Fed who have studied parti cipation rates and the like .  So I think a lot of the unemployment decline that we \u2019ve seen , contrary to sometimes what you hear, I think a lot of it really does come from jobs as opposed to declining participation.   That being said, there certainly is a portion of the decline in participation , which is related to people dropping out of the labor force because they are discouraged, because their skills have become obsolete, because they \u2019ve lost attachment to the labor force , and so on.  The Fed can address that , to some extent , if\u2014you know, if we \u2019re able to get the economy closer to   full employment, then some people who are discouraged or who have been unemployed for a long time might find that they have opportunities to rejoin the labor market .   But I think, fundamentally , that tr aining our workforce to fit the needs of 21st -century industry in the world that we have today is the job of both the private educational sector and the government educational sector .  We have many strengths in our educational sector , including outstanding  universities , but we have a lot of weaknesses , as you know .  There are many, many factors that affect participation \u2014employment, wages , and so on, but the one I think that we can most directly affect is the skill level of our workforce .  And that doesn\u2019 t mean everybody  has to go to get a Ph .D.  People have different needs, different interests .  But that , I think, is one of the biggest challenges that our society faces , and if we don\u2019 t address it, then we \u2019re going to see a larger and larger number of people who are either unemployed, underemployed, or working at very low wages , which obviously is not something we want to see.

The Committee acknowledged that the economy is making progress but still has a long way to go before reaching normal conditions, with ongoing concerns about unemployment, underemployment, and low labor force participation.The FOMC is closely monitoring inflation developments and recognizes that persistently low inflation could pose risks to economic performance. FOMC participants expect economic growth to pick up and the unemployment rate to continue declining, while inflation is projected to gradually move back towards the 2 percent objective.The FOMC began the asset purchase program in 2012 with the goal of improving the labor market and maintaining price stability. Since then, there has been significant progress, with the economy adding 2.9 million jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 7 percent. Recent economic indicators have increased confidence in continued job market gains, and with fiscal restraint diminishing and household spending picking up, economic growth is expected to support further job gains. Starting in January, the FOMC will reduce monthly purchases of securities by $5 billion each.The Federal Reserve will continue to expand its holdings of longer-term securities at a rapid pace, while also rolling over maturing Treasury securities and reinvesting principal payments. These actions are expected to support the labor market, promote progress towards the Committee's inflation objective, and maintain accommodative financial conditions. The Committee's modest reduction in asset purchases reflects its belief in sustained progress, but future adjustments will be deliberate and dependent on incoming information.The FOMC has stated that the current low target range for the federal funds rate will remain appropriate as long as certain conditions are met, but crossing a threshold does not automatically lead to a rate increase. The Committee expects to maintain the current rate target even after the unemployment rate falls below 6 \u00c2\u00bd percent due to the substantial amount of slack in the labor market.The FOMC expects a modest increase in the federal funds rate in 2015, with some members not anticipating an increase until 2016. The Committee also plans to reduce the pace of monthly asset purchases if economic progress continues, but emphasizes that the process will be data-dependent and not on a preset course.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Can you provide more information about the framework for determining the size and timing of future reductions in asset purchases? Is it still likely that the program will end by the middle of next year?\n'ANSWER': The steps taken will depend on data. If progress is made in terms of inflation and job gains, there will likely be measured reductions at each meeting, taking us to late in the year, not the middle. If the economy slows or outcomes are disappointing, meetings may be skipped. If things improve, the pace could increase, but moderate steps are expected throughout most of 2014.", "'QUESTION': When you say \u00e2\u0080\u009csimilar moderate steps going forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is $10 billion an increment that people should anticipate? And is equal amounts of mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries also what one should anticipate? Finally, when you say \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell past\u00e2\u0080\u009d the unemployment rate of 6\u00c2\u00bd percent, why not pick a number?\n'ANSWER': We will take further modest steps, with $10 billion being the general range, but it will depend on data. We could stop purchases if the economy disappoints or increase them if the economy is stronger. Equal reductions in MBS and Treasuries is the simpler strategy. The unemployment rate is a good indicator, but we also consider other labor market indicators. It will take some time past 6\u00c2\u00bd percent for all variables to line up and give us confidence in the labor market.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk about the role that Janet Yellen played in formulating the policy being laid out today and what kind of consistency the public can expect under her leadership?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke confirms that Janet Yellen played a significant role in formulating the policy and that he has always consulted closely with her. He assures that the public can expect consistency under her leadership as she fully supports the decisions made today.", "'QUESTION': Why should we believe the Fed has a symmetric inflation target and that they are following an optimal control policy?\n'ANSWER': Inflation forecasts have not reached 2 percent, but there are uncertainties and standard errors around these estimates. The Fed expects inflation to gradually move back to 2 percent, allowing for the possibility of it going as high as 2.5 percent. Factors such as low healthcare costs and improving fundamentals suggest inflation will rise. The Fed is committed to preventing inflation from staying too low and will take necessary actions.", "'QUESTION': Can inflation be quickly moved to target under optimal control?\n'ANSWER': Even under optimal control, inflation is quite inertial and takes a while to move. The responsiveness of inflation to increasing economic activity is low, especially in an environment with falling oil prices and other factors pushing inflation down. However, the Federal Reserve is committed to taking necessary actions to bring inflation back to target in the next couple of years.", "'QUESTION': Are you giving up on monetary policy and have you reached the limit of your policy tools?\n'ANSWER': Monetary policy cannot solve all problems and cannot address a slowing in potential growth or fiscal policy. However, the outcomes have not been as bad as they may seem, as monetary policy has offset a significant portion of fiscal drag. The FOMC intends to maintain a highly accommodative policy and continue buying assets.", "'QUESTION': Was there a lot of debate on whether or not to start tapering now or wait for more data?\n'ANSWER': The decision to start tapering was extensively debated. The criterion for tapering was a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook, which has been met. There is still concern about inflation, but if it does not return to target, appropriate action will be taken.", "'QUESTION': Have you considered any alternative measures, such as more direct stimulus, if the economy were to stumble again in the future?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke asks for clarification on what kind of direct stimulus is being referred to.", "'QUESTION': Well, any type of stimulus that you would not be essentially buying it back from the banks?\n'ANSWER': In terms of the legal authorities that the Federal Reserve has, we don't have some of the stimulus tools that would involve directly buying assets from the banks.", "'QUESTION': Would you increase the bond purchases?\n'ANSWER': We are already being pretty aggressive with our basic tools of asset purchases, forward guidance, and interest rate changes. Increasing bond purchases is a possibility, but there are limits to how effective it would be, as markets may not view long-term guidance as credible and banks in the US already have plenty of liquidity.", "'QUESTION': Did the changeover in leadership play any role in the decision on when to begin tapering?\n'ANSWER': The changeover in leadership did not play a role in the decision on when to begin tapering. The decision was based on the economic conditions and the progress made towards the Fed's goals. \n\n'QUESTION': What do you think future historians of monetary policy will have to say about your eight years at the Federal Reserve helm?\n'ANSWER': Future historians of monetary policy will likely analyze the actions taken during the chairman's tenure, including the response to the financial crisis and the implementation of unconventional monetary policy tools. The impact of these actions on the economy and the effectiveness of the Fed's policies will be evaluated.", "'QUESTION': Did the changeover in leadership play any role in the decision on when to begin tapering?\n'ANSWER': No, the change in leadership did not play a role in the decision. As for the broader question, future historians of monetary policy will have to assess the Fed's rediscovery of its roots in stabilizing the financial system during times of panic and its use of unconventional methods to help the economy recover from a deep recession in a near-zero interest rate environment.", "QUESTION: Is the decision to reduce asset purchases more about concerns of their effectiveness or fueling bubbles rather than an improved outlook for the economy?\n\nANSWER: Asset purchases are a supplementary tool and less familiar than interest rate policy. Managing a large balance sheet becomes more difficult and there are concerns about effects on asset prices. The decision to reduce asset purchases is not intended as a tightening, but to achieve the same level of accommodation using interest rates and forward guidance.", "'QUESTION': Has there been any further discussion on changing the unemployment threshold or adding a lower bound to the inflation target? What tools or actions could the Committee take if inflation continues to run below target?\n'ANSWER': The Committee wants to assess the current situation and does not expect any immediate changes. They will monitor the level of accommodation and whether the economy is growing and inflation is moving towards the target. Strengthening guidance and asset purchases are options that have not been ruled out if needed. The Committee is hopeful for continued progress in the economy.", "'QUESTION': Why are you not erring on the side of doing more in terms of monetary policy, considering the argument for being more aggressive in times of high unemployment?\n\n'ANSWER': We are not doing less, but rather slowing asset purchases. However, we expect the balance sheet to remain large and rates to stay low for a long time. We believe we are providing a great deal of accommodation to the economy and have been aggressive in trying to keep it growing, with progress seen in the labor market.", "'QUESTION': Given the billions of dollars that the Fed has put into the economy over the years, do you see a leading reason why the economy has not created more jobs?\n'ANSWER': The slow recovery and lack of job creation can be attributed to various factors such as financial crises disrupting the economy, the housing bust affecting the construction sector, ongoing financial disturbances, tight fiscal policy, and disappointing productivity. Despite these challenges, the US recovery has been better than most other advanced industrial countries recovering from financial crises.", "'QUESTION': Could you talk about the recent budget deal and its impact on reducing the U.S. debt burden?\n'ANSWER': The budget deal is a positive step as it eases fiscal restraint in the next few years, providing much-needed help to the economy. It also achieves savings in the long term. While more work needs to be done, the bipartisan cooperation and progress are good for confidence.", "'QUESTION': What rules would you have liked to have seen tougher and finished before you leave? Do you feel that the safeguards are now in place and the system is safer?\n'ANSWER': The system is safer, evidenced by the amount of capital large banks hold. Basel III requirements and stress testing have been important in measuring banks' abilities to survive bad situations. There are still important rules to complete, but the impact of these rules on the safety of the system remains to be seen.", "'QUESTION': What final words of wisdom does Chairman Bernanke have for Congress as they consider possible legislative changes to the structure and mandate of the Federal Reserve?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke emphasizes the transparency and accountability of the Fed, stating that they are open to working with Congress to improve their operations. He believes that the dual mandate has served them well, allowing them to speed up economic recovery and job creation. In hindsight, he admits they were slow to recognize the crisis and could have taken more preventive action. However, he believes they have strengthened the Fed's ability to monitor and stabilize the economy and financial system.", "'QUESTION': Do you envision any role for yourself in South Carolina post-chairmanship? And do debt and deficits weigh down long-term decision making?\n'ANSWER': I cannot comment on my post-chairmanship plans. Regarding debt and deficits, they may be reducing long-term investment and hindering expansion. It may require more drastic action in the short-term.", "'QUESTION': Can you tell us about your plans for the Christmas vacation?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke mentions that he and his wife will be spending their Christmas vacation in North Carolina, where most of his family resides, including family members in Charlotte and Durham. He also mentions his 85-year-old uncle who still lives in Dillon and is in good spirits.", "'QUESTION': What are the reasons for weaker investment?\n'ANSWER': The slow recovery and slow-growing economy are the main reasons for weaker investment. Other factors include uncertainties in fiscal, regulatory, and tax policies. However, high interest rates are not a problem as there is plenty of credit available at low rates. Faster overall growth, increased consumer spending, and exports are expected to stimulate investment.", "'QUESTION': To what extent has the calculation of the cost and efficacy of asset purchases changed and how did it affect today's decision? How will threats to financial stability and potential losses on the Fed's portfolio be considered?\n'ANSWER': The cost-benefit ratio of asset purchases becomes less favorable as the balance sheet grows. While the Fed has made profits for the government, rising interest rates could lead to a few years without remittances to the Treasury, causing problems. Asset purchases are effective but less attractive than interest rate policy, and there are concerns about financial stability. The Fed's first line of defense is regulatory measures, but financial instability can impact their mandate. The asset purchases program is on track to meet objectives and is being slowed down based on reaching those objectives, not due to cost or efficacy concerns.", "'QUESTION': Do you feel the third round of asset purchases packed as much bang for your buck? And do you still think the first study offered a reasonable estimate?\n'ANSWER': It is hard to know the exact impact of the asset purchases, as it is an imprecise science. The first study was on the upper end of estimates, but I am comfortable with the idea that the program did create jobs. The asset purchases brought down interest rates and had a positive response in the economy. The precise size of the impact is still uncertain, which is why it is treated as a supplementary tool.", "'QUESTION': How much of an economic impact do you see unemployment benefits expiring having and what effect would it have on the unemployment rate?\n'ANSWER': The economic impact on those directly affected is significant, but the overall effect on the economy is likely to be small. While the additional income from benefits stimulates growth, some individuals may drop out of the labor force, artificially lowering the unemployment rate. The focus should be on the impact on those directly affected rather than the overall economy.", "'QUESTION': What advice has been given to Janet Yellen regarding dealing with Congress and maintaining policy independence?\n'ANSWER': Congress is the boss of the Federal Reserve, and while maintaining policy independence is important, it is also necessary to explain and justify decisions to Congress. The Federal Reserve is an effective central bank and hopes that any review by Congress will involve highly qualified individuals discussing necessary changes on a high level.", "'QUESTION': How much do you see longer-term unemployment and the drop in labor force participation as the result of structural changes in the economy, and to what extent can the government help alleviate that?\n'ANSWER': Many declines in the participation rate are demographic or structural, reflecting sociological trends. While some decline is due to people dropping out of the labor force, the majority of unemployment decline comes from jobs rather than declining participation. The government and private educational sector need to address the challenge of training the workforce to fit the needs of the 21st-century industry."]}
