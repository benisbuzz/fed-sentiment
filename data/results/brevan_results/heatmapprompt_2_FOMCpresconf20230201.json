T hank you for doing this.  As you know , financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields falling, which has also brought down mortgage rates, and the stock market posted a solid gain in January.  Does that make your job of combating inflation harder?  And could you see lifting rates higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in\u2014or to offset the easing of financial conditions?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we \u2019re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent .  And , of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year.  I would say that our focus is not on short -term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions.  And it is our judgment that we \u2019re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate.  Of course, many things affect financial conditions \u2014not just our policy.

Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Over the last quarter, we \u2019ve seen a deceleration in prices, in wages, and a fall in consumer spending, all wh ile the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a historic low.  Does this, at all, change your view of how much the unemployment rate would need to go up, if at all, to see inflation come down to the levels you \u2019re looking for?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market.   But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see under  way is really at an early stage.   What you see is, really , in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated.  So you see that .  In the other \u2014in the housing services sector , we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while but then to come down, assuming that  [rent increases associated with]  new leases continue to be lower.   So, in those two sectors, you\u2019 ve got a good story.  The issue is that we have a large sector called nonhousing service\u2014core nonhousing services, where we don\u2019 t see dis inflation yet.

I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now    getting under  way, and we continue to get strong labor market data.  So \u2014but, you know, we \u2019ll update those forecasts in March.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.  You and some of your colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses.  We saw the opposite in the December JOLTS this morning .  Job openings are actually rising.  That also coinci ded with slowdown in wage inflation.  Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So you\u2019 re right about the data, of course .  What we did see\u2014w e\u2019ve seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated.  The job openings number has \u2014in JOLTS, has been quite  volatile recently.  Yeah, I did see that it moved up\u2014back up this morning.  I do think that it \u2019s probably an important indicator.  The ratio, I guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work.  So it\u2019s an indicator, but nonetheless, we \u2014you\u2019 re right, we do see wages moving down.  If you look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation.  And, you know, quits are still at an elevated level .  So many, many\u2014by many, many indicator s, the job market is still very strong.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times .  Given the economic data since the December meeting , is the trajectory for the fed funds rate in the most    recen t SEP still the best guidepost for the policy path forward?  Or does ongoing now mean more than two rate rises now?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So you\u2019 re right.  At the December meeting, we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that \u2019s obviously back in December.  And the median for that was between 5 and 5\u00bc percent.  At the March meeting, we\u2019re going to update those assessments.  We did not update them today.   We did, however, continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent .  We think we \u2019ve covered a lot of ground, and financial conditions have  certainly tightened.  I would say we still think there \u2019s work to do there.  We haven \u2019t made a decision on exactly where that will be.   I think, you know, we \u2019re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then t he May meeting.  I don\u2019 t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be.   It could certainly be higher than we \u2019re writing down right now.  If we come to the view that we need to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December , we would certainly do that.  At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction , then we \u2019ll, you know, we \u2019ll make data -dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Just as a quick follow -up, how are you viewing the kind of bal ance of risk between those two options of, you know, the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or going beyond that level?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I guess I would say it this way.  I continue to think that it \u2019s very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually were close but didn\u2019 t get the job done .  Inflation springs back , and we have to go back in.  And now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing.  This is a    very difficult risk to manage, whereas I \u2014of course, we have no incentive and no desire to overtighten.  But we , you know, if we feel like we \u2019ve gone too far, we can certainly \u2014and inflation is coming down faster than we expect , then we have tools that would work on that.  So I do think that , in this situation , where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know, the job is not fully done.  As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents 56 percent  of the core inflation index where we don \u2019t see dis inflation yet.  So we don\u2019 t see it.  It\u2019s not happening yet.  Inflation in the core services ex. housing is still running at 4 pe rcent  on a 6- and 12- month basis.  So there \u2019s not \u2014nothing happening there.  In the other two sectors representing, you know, less than 50 percent,  you actually, I think, now have a story that is credible, that\u2019 s coming together, although you don\u2019 t actually  see dis inflation yet in housing services, but it \u2019s in the pipeline, right?  So, for the third sector, we don\u2019 t see anything here.  So I think it would be premature \u2014it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that we\u2019ve really got this.  We n eed to see \u2014our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down.  And how do we get that done?  There are many , many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they should be coming into play to have inflation\u2014the disinflationary process begin in that sector.  But, so far, we don\u2019 t see that.  And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work left to do.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks as usual.  So I just wanted to connect a couple of dots here.  The statement made a number of changes that seem to be saying things are getting better.  You \u2019re saying inflation has eased  T hat\u2019s new.  You\u2019ve ta ken out references to the war in Ukraine that \u2019s causing price increases.  You \u2019ve taken out references to the pandemic.   You \u2019ve eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were    being driven higher, yet that \u2019s not mapping to any change in how you describe policy.  We still have ongoing increases to come.  So I \u2019m wondering, why is that the case?  And does it have more to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself  and overreact?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I guess I would say it this way.  We can now say, I think, for the first time that the disinflationary process has started.  We can see that.  And we see it , really , in goods prices so far.  Goods prices is a big sector.   We\u2014t his is what we thought would happen since the very beginning,  and now here it is actually happening, a nd for the reasons we thought .  We\u2014you know, it \u2019s supply chains, it \u2019s shortages, and it \u2019s demand revolving back towards services.  So this is a good thing.  This is a good thing.  But that\u2019 s, you know, around a quarter of the PCE price index\u2014core PCE price index.  So the second sector is housing services , and that \u2019s driven by very different things.  And we \u2014as I mentioned , with housing services, we  expect , and other forecasters expect , that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but will then come down , assuming that  [rent increases associated with]  new leases continue to be soft.  And we do assume that.  So we think that that\u2019 s sort of in the pipeline.  And we actually see disinflation in the goods sector , and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half.   So this is good.  And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this is good.  We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core goods ex. housing\u2014sorry, the core services ex. housing sector that I talked about.  We don\u2019 t see it yet.  It \u2019s\u2014you know, it \u2019s seven or eight different kinds of se rvices, not all of them are the same.  And, you know, we have a sense of what \u2019s going on in each of those different subsections.  Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent  of that is, you know, research would show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be    important.   Some of the other ones it \u2019s\u2014the labor market is not going to be important.  Many other factors will drive it.   In any case, we don\u2019 t see dis inflation in that sector yet.  And I think we need to see that it \u2019s the majority of the core PCE index , which is the thing that we think is the best predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with ] our mandate.  So it\u2019s not tha t we\u2019re not \u2014we \u2019re neither optimistic nor pessimistic .  We\u2019re just telling you that we don\u2019 t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector.  I think we will fairly soon, but we don\u2019t see it yet.  Until we do, I think we \u2014you know, we see ourselves, we \u2019ve got to be honest with ourselves , but w e see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent \u2014we\u2019ll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down.  And we \u2019re just going to  have to\u2014w e have to complete the job.  Y ou know, that \u2019s what we\u2019 re here for.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, you observed several years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above -target inflation.  And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high level despite a historically low unemployment rate.   Given that, and given how much you did over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed?   Why not stop here a nd see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we \u2019ve\u2014you know, we \u2019ve raised rates 4\u00bd percentage points , and we\u2019re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictiv e.  And why do we think that \u2019s probably necessary?   We think, because inflation is still running very hot .  We\u2019 re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we \u2019re thinking about that.  It really \u2014the story we \u2019re telling about inflation is to ourselves , and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I\u2019 ve just gone through a couple of times.  And ,    again, we don\u2019 t see it affecting the services sector ex. housing yet.  But , I mean , I think our assessment is that we\u2019 re not very f ar from that level.  We don \u2019t know that, though.  We don\u2019 t know that.  So I think we \u2019re\u2014you know, we \u2019re living in a world of significant uncertainty.   I would look across the rate \u2014the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by \u2014you know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve.  I think policy is restrictive.   We\u2019re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough.  That \u2019s all.  And we \u2019re going to \u2014you know, that \u2019s why we \u2019re slowing down to 25 basis points.

We judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.

Mr. Chairman, the S EP has the P CE inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1 percent .  Meanwhile, the three- month annualized PCE is 2.1 percent , and you\u2019 ve achieved this without going to your 5.1 percent  funds rate, which is what you have    penciled in for this year.  And you\u2019 ve also achieved it witho ut the 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year.  I \u2019m wondering if you\u2019 ve considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong, and it \u2019s possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without the surge in unemployment.  And, specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair Lael Brainard, who said, \u201c To the extent that inputs other than wages may be responsible in part for important price increases for some nonhousing services, an unwinding of these factors .\u201d  In other words, it may not be wages.  The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get this sector of inflation under control.  Than ks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So a couple of things.  First, on the forecast, if\u2014you\u2019 re right\u2014i f you take very short -term three -month, say, measures of PCE \u2014core PCE inflation, they \u2019re quite low right now.  But that \u2019s because that \u2019s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from goods inflation.  Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer -run trend of something around zero, something like that.   So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go back up to 4  percent  by the middle of the year, for example.  So that \u2019s really where the sustainable level is.  It\u2019s more like at 4  percent .  So that would suggest there \u2019s work left to do.  You know, let \u2019s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible.  As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data  dependent.  We would take that into account.  In terms of the non\u2014sorry, the core nonhousing services , as I mentioned earlier, it \u2019s a very diverse sector, six or seven sectors.  And so  sectors that represent 55 or 60  percent  of that\u2014   subsectors of that sector are\u2014we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the labor market in a way, but som e of the other sectors are not.   And, for example, you know, financial services is a big sector that \u2019s really not driven by labor markets \u2014wages.  So that \u2019s why I said there are a number of things that will affect\u2014t ake restaurants, right?  So, clearly, labor is important for restaurants but so are food prices.   And, you know, transportation services is going to be driven by fuel prices, for example.  So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation.  I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you \u2019re not going to have, you know, a sustainable return to 2 percent  inflation in that sector without a better balance in the labor market.  And I don\u2019 t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question.  I do thi nk there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften.  And so far , we\u2019ve got \u2014as I mentioned, in goods , we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market.   I think most forecasters would say that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here.   But I still think \u2014I continue to think that there \u2019s a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent  without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment.   And that \u2019s because the\u2014you know, the setting we \u2019re in is quite different.  The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior \u2014you know, in prior business cycles.  And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down.  And I think will\u2014a  story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough.  But I think there is \u2014there\u2019s ongoing disinflation , and we don\u2019 t yet see weakening in the labor market.  So we \u2019ll have to see.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Can we get there with 5  percent ?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Certainly possible.  Yeah .  Absolutely it \u2019s possible.   You know, it \u2019s a question\u2014no one really knows.  I think it \u2019s because this is not like the other business cycles in so many ways.  It may well be that as \u2014yeah, as \u2014that it will take more slowing than we expect \u2014than I expect to get inflation down to 2  percent .  But I don\u2019 t\u2014that\u2019s not my base case.  My bas e case is that the economy can return to 2  percent  inflation without a really significant downturn or a really big increase in unemployment.  I think that \u2019s a possible outcome.   I think many, many forecasters would say it \u2019s not the most likely outcome .  But I would say there \u2019s a chance of it.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio.  I \u2019d like to pick up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask, with the full weight of your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation, there \u2019s still a lot of talk about very, very slow growth going forward in 2023.  And the recession indicators are all suggesting that we are going to see rec ession this year.  So I \u2019m wondering if you\u2019 ve changed your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is going forward and whether you\u2019 re very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place, which calls for more restraint on your part.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I do think you\u2014most forecast s and, you know, my own assessment would be that that growth will continue \u2014positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year.  We had growth of \u2014GDP growth of 1 per cent last year and also final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator , of about 1  percent .  I think, you know, most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year.  There are other fa ctors, though, that need to be considered.  You will    have seen that the global picture is improving a bit , and that will matter for us, potentially.  The labor market remains very, very strong, and that \u2019s job creation , that\u2019s wages.  As inflation does come  down, sentiment will improve.  You also\u2014state and local governments are really flush these days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks.  So I think that \u2019s going to support \u2014they\u2019re also spending a lot.  Ther e\u2019s a lot of spending coming in the construction pipeline, both private and public.  And so that \u2019s going to support economic activity.  So I think there \u2019s a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year.  And that \u2019s my base case , is that there will be positive growth this year.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Rich Miller from Bloomberg.  First off, how are you doing?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Fine .  Thanks.  Fine.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Good.  Second off, I think, earlier on in the press conference, you said you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down.  Can you give us some idea of what you\u2019 re thinking of?  You mentioned three months \u2014that we \u2019ve seen three months in a row.  Governor Wal ler suggested he might want to see six months.  And so  is it just the inflation data , or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have that \u201c substantially more evidence \u201d metric \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I don\u2019 t think there \u2019s, you know, going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that.  I think it \u2019s just an accumulating \u2014accumulation of evidence.  So, of course, we \u2019ll be looking \u2014by the time of the March meeting, we\u2019ll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports, and we \u2019ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will.  A nd we \u2019ll be asking ourselves, what are they telling us?  And soon after that, we \u2019ll have another ECI wage    report, which, as you know , is a report that we like because it  adjusts  for composition and it \u2019s very complete.   And, you know, the one we got, I guess it was yesterday, was some \u2014was constructive.   It\u2019s\u2014you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level.  They \u2019re still at a level that\u2019 s way above \u2014well above where they were before the pandemic.  So I don\u2019 t want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it \u2019s going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy over time.   But I will say, though, we \u2014you know, it is our job to restore price stability and achieve 2 percent  inflation for the benefit of the American public.   We \u2019re not \u2014market participants have a very different job.   It\u2019s a fine job .  It\u2019s a great job.   In fact, I did that job for years but in one form or another.  But, you know, we have to deliver that.  And so we are strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle.  Thank you, Fed Chairman, for taking the questions.  So you\u2019 ve talked about we had solid job growth.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business, by the way.  We had solid job growth, a slight falling in the increase in consumer spending.  It seems so far it \u2019s been relatively mild from the economy to go to \u2014from a 9.1 percent  CPI inflation to 6.5  percent  CPI inflation.  Is the hard part yet to come to go from 6.5 to 2?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I don\u2019 t think we know, honestly.  You know, the \u2014so we, of course, expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn\u2019 t come down all through \u2019 22.  And now it \u2019s coming down, and it \u2019s come down pretty fast.   So I would say these are\u2014this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a    global pandemic and we shut the economy down a nd Congress did what it did and we did what we did.  It\u2019 s just \u2014it\u2019s unique.  So I think certainty is ju st not appropriate here.  Inflation \u2014it\u2019s just harder to forecast inflation.   It may come down faster .  It may take longer to come down.  And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target , and we will do that.   But I think we\u2019re going to be caut ious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think that the game is won because, you know, it \u2019s\u2014we \u2019ve got a long way to go.  It\u2019 s just \u2014it\u2019s the early stages of disinflation.   And it \u2019s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in disinflation, but that \u2019s great.  But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that it\u2019s going to take some time .  That\u2019s all.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Do you \u2014how long do you see the n, the federal funds rate remaining at this elevated level?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, so\u2014a gain, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the S EP and \u2014I mean, there are many different forecasts, but , generally, it \u2019s a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly.  And , in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year.  Of course, other people have forecasts with i nflation coming down much faster, that \u2019s a different thing.  You know, if that happens \u2014inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we \u2019ll be seeing that , and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chair Powell.  Simon Rabinovitch with t he Economist .  May I ask a further question about the language around \u201c ongoing increases ?\u201d  T hat, of course, implies at least two further rate rises .  If you look at fed fund and  futures pricing, the    implication is that you \u2019ll raise rates one more time and then pause.  Are you concerned about that divergence or do you think, if everything breaks right, is that a plausible outcome?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I\u2019m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is largely due to the market \u2019s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly.  I think that\u2019s the bigger part of that.  So, again, as I just mentioned, we \u2014you know, our forecasts \u2014different participants have  differe nt forecasts, but , generally, those forecasts are for continued subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession.  And we have inflation moving down, you know, into th e\u2014somewhere in the mid -threes or maybe lower than that this year.  We \u2019ll update that in March, but that \u2019s what we thought in December.  Markets are past that.  They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that.  So we \u2019ll just have to see.  And we have a different view and \u2014a different view, it \u2019s a different forecast, really.  And given our outlook, I just \u2014I don\u2019 t see us cutting rates this year if we get \u2014if our outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now.  If we do see inflation coming down much more quickly, that \u2019ll play into our policy s etting , of course.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Scott Horsle y from NPR.  One of the changes in the statement this month is that the C ommittee is no longer listing public health as among the data points you\u2019 ll conside r in assessing conditions.  What should we make of that?   Does the Federal Reserve no longer see the pandemic as weighing on the economy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: That \u2019s the general sense of it.   Look, we understand \u2014I personally understand well that COVID is still out there, but that it \u2019s no longer playing an important role in our economy.  And, you know, we \u2019ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think we just \u2014we knew we would take it out at some point.  There \u2019s never a perfect time , but we    thought  that\u2014you know, people are handling it better , and the economy and the society are handling it better now.  It doesn\u2019 t really need to be in a \u2014you know, in the F ed\u2019s monthly, you know, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health issue.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  I wanted to go back to another thing that Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said recently.  She said she doesn \u2019t see signs of a wage\u2013price spiral, and I \u2019m wondering if you agree with that.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I do.  Yeah, I do.  You don\u2019 t see that yet.   But the whole point is, you know, if you\u2014once you see it, you have a serious problem.  That means that , effectively, in people \u2019s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue.  And once that happens \u2014that\u2019s what we can \u2019t allow to happen.  And, you know, so that \u2019s why we worry that the longer we\u2019re at this and the longer people are talking about  inflation all day long, every day, you know, the more risk of something like that.  But no, there \u2019s not much\u2014i t\u2019s more of a risk.  It always has been more of a risk than anything else.  By the way, I think it \u2019s becoming less salient.   And people are \u2014you know, we pick that up in conversations.  And I \u2019ve seen some data, too, that show people are, you know, gradually\u2014they\u2019 re glad that inflation is coming down.  People really don\u2019 t like inflation.  And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity.  You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they\u2019 re very, very low with 3\u00bd percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical standards.  Why can that be?  It has to be inflation, right?   So I think once infla tion is seen to be coming down in coming months , even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.   So that \u2019s what you\u2019 re looking at most closely, is consumer expectations?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: That \u2019s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know, are the\u2014essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of the process of creating inflation.  That \u2019s a sort of bedrock belief .  In one way or another , it has to be.  We think it\u2019 s important.  And , in this case, I would say , the risk eight months ago or so, longer -term inflation expectations had moved up.  We moved quite vigorously last year.  Expectations are\u2014seem to be well  anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the  longer end.  So it \u2019s, you know \u2014and that \u2019s\u2014I think that \u2019s very reassuring.  I think, you know, the markets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent  and it\u2019 s just a matter of us following through .  That's immeasurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down.  The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down, that \u2019ll be part of the process of getting it down.  And it \u2019s a very positive thing.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  In the minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of sentences that struck people as important , when the C ommittee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down.  I haven\u2019 t seen \u2014heard you talk much about that today or in the statement.  So I was wondering, has that concern eased among members, or is that still something you \u2019re concerned about?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I would put it this way.  It \u2019s something that we monitor carefully.  Financial conditions didn \u2019t really change much from the December meeting to now.  They    mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place.  It\u2019s important that the markets do reflect the tightening that we \u2019re putting in place.  As we \u2019ve discussed a couple times here, there \u2019s a difference in perspective b y some market measures on how fast inflation will come down.  We\u2019 re just going to have to see.  I mean, I \u2019m not going to try to persuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and some patience and that we\u2019 ll need to keep rates higher for longer.

While financial conditions have loosened, we believe we are not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance. We will consider overall financial conditions along with other factors when setting policy.", "'QUESTION': Does the recent deceleration in prices, wages, and consumer spending, while maintaining a low unemployment rate, change your perspective on the necessary increase in unemployment to achieve desired inflation levels?\n\n'ANSWER': The disinflation observed so far has not negatively impacted the labor market. The current disinflationary process is in its early stages, with inflation decreasing in the goods sector due to fixed supply chains and shifting demand to services. In the housing services sector, inflation is expected to rise before eventually decreasing. However, the nonhousing service sector still lacks disinflation. Overall, progress has been made without weakening labor market conditions.", "'QUESTION': Has your \u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry.\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell allows the reporter to continue their question.", "'QUESTION': Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go changed since December?\n'ANSWER': No, new forecasts will be written down in March. The disinflationary process is starting and strong labor market data continues to be received. Forecasts will be updated in March.", "'QUESTION': Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading?\n'ANSWER': The job openings number in JOLTS is volatile but likely an important indicator. The ratio of job openings to unemployed people is 1.9, indicating a strong job market. Despite wage inflation abating, other indicators such as high payroll job creation and elevated quits suggest a strong labor market.", "'QUESTION': Is the trajectory for the fed funds rate in the most recent SEP still the best guidepost for the policy path forward?\n'ANSWER': At the December meeting, the median estimate for the ultimate level of the fed funds rate was between 5 and 5\u00c2\u00bc percent. The assessments will be updated at the March meeting, and ongoing rate hikes are still considered appropriate to bring inflation back down to 2 percent. The decision on the exact rate will depend on incoming data.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve view the balance of risk between falling short of inflation targets and overshooting them?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell believes it is difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and not achieving the desired outcome. If inflation rebounds and expectations become unanchored, it becomes challenging to address. However, if they tighten too much and inflation decreases faster than expected, they have tools to address that. With inflation still high and certain sectors not showing disinflation, the job is not yet complete.", "QUESTION: Why are prices still expected to increase despite the improvements mentioned in the statement?\n\nANSWER: The disinflationary process has started, particularly in goods prices, due to supply chain issues and a shift in demand towards services. However, housing services, which make up a significant portion of the PCE price index, are driven by different factors. While inflation is expected to come down in the goods sector and housing services in the coming months, it has not yet been observed in the majority of the core services sector. The Federal Reserve remains committed to addressing persistent inflation in that sector.", "QUESTION: Why do you think further rate increases are needed despite low unemployment and decreasing inflation?\n\nANSWER: We believe further rate increases are necessary because inflation is still running high. We are considering long and variable lags and believe that inflation may soon affect the services sector. We acknowledge the uncertainty and are carefully monitoring the economy, inflation, and the disinflationary process.", "'QUESTION': Did the FOMC discuss the conditions for a pause at this meeting?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell stated that the minutes will provide more detail in three weeks.

He clarifies that the Federal Reserve cannot protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner, as they are the Treasury's fiscal agent.", "'QUESTION': Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell stated that it is Congress' responsibility to raise the debt ceiling and they are not involved in those discussions.", "'QUESTION': Was there any discussion of pausing rate increases and then restarting them?\n'ANSWER': The Committee did not see this as the time to pause.

New forecasts will be written in March, and incoming data will be considered.", "'QUESTION': Would it be possible for the Federal Open Market Committee to take breaks between rate moves, like skipping a meeting and then resuming?\n'ANSWER': The Committee is not currently considering or exploring this option in detail. However, in the past, they have gone every other meeting with a 25 basis points move, which was considered a fast pace. The Bank of Canada has shown willingness to raise rates after pausing, but the FOMC is not currently deciding on this.", "QUESTION: Have you considered the possibility that your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong and it's possible to achieve low inflation without raising rates or increasing unemployment?\n\nANSWER: Short-term measures of PCE inflation are low due to significantly negative readings from goods inflation, which is expected to be transitory. Most forecasts predict core PCE to rise to around 4 percent by the middle of the year. If inflation comes down faster than expected, it would be taken into account. Achieving sustainable low inflation in certain sectors may require a better balance in the labor market, but it may not necessarily require a significant economic decline or increase in unemployment.", "'QUESTION': Can inflation be brought down to 2 percent with a 5 percent decrease?\n'ANSWER': It is possible, but uncertain. This economic cycle is different, and it may require more slowing than expected to achieve 2 percent inflation. However, my base case is that the economy can reach 2 percent inflation without a major downturn or increase in unemployment. While not the most likely outcome, there is a chance of it.", "QUESTION: With concerns about slow growth and recession indicators, have you changed your view on the danger to economic growth and the need for more restraint?\n\nANSWER: Growth is expected to continue at a subdued pace, similar to last year. However, there are factors to consider such as global improvements, a strong labor market, and increased spending by state and local governments. These factors are likely to support positive growth this year.", "'QUESTION': How is Chair Powell doing?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell is doing fine.", "'QUESTION': Can you give us some idea of what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking of when you say you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down?\n'ANSWER': We will be looking at the upcoming employment reports, CPI reports, and ECI wage report to assess the evidence. As the accumulated evidence comes in, it will be reflected in our assessment of the outlook and our policy over time. Our goal is to restore price stability and achieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public.", "'QUESTION': Is the hard part yet to come in reducing CPI inflation from 6.5% to 2%?\n'ANSWER': We don't know for certain. The current situation is unique and not comparable to previous business cycles. Forecasting inflation is challenging, and it may come down faster or take longer. Our goal is to bring inflation back to target, but we remain cautious and recognize that there is still a long way to go in the early stages of disinflation.", "'QUESTION': How long do you see the federal funds rate remaining at this elevated level?\n'ANSWER': If the economy performs as expected with slower growth, softening labor market conditions, and steady but not quick inflation decline, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year. However, if inflation comes down much faster, it will be incorporated into our policy thinking.", "QUESTION: Are you concerned about the divergence between the market's expectation of one more rate rise and then a pause, and the Fed's outlook for continued subdued growth and inflation moving down?\n\nANSWER: Chair Powell is not particularly concerned about the divergence, as it is largely due to the market's expectation of faster inflation decline. The Fed's outlook differs from the market's, and if their outlook turns true, there won't be any rate cuts this year. However, if inflation declines more quickly, it will impact their policy decisions.", "'QUESTION': What does the removal of public health as a data point in the statement indicate about the Federal Reserve's view on the pandemic's impact on the economy?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve no longer sees the pandemic as weighing on the economy. While COVID is still present, it is no longer playing an important role in the economy. The decision to remove it from the statement reflects the belief that people and the economy are handling it better now and that it is more of a health issue than an ongoing economic risk.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree with Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard's statement that there are no signs of a wage-price spiral?\n'ANSWER': Yes, I agree. We haven't seen that yet. However, if it does happen, it would indicate that inflation has become a significant concern. We are worried that prolonged discussions about inflation could increase the risk of such a spiral. But currently, it's more of a risk than a reality. People are gradually becoming less concerned about inflation, and as it comes down, it could boost economic activity and sentiment.", "'QUESTION': Is consumer expectations of future inflation an important factor in creating inflation?\n'ANSWER': Yes, consumer and business expectations of future inflation are crucial in the process of creating inflation. The belief that expectations of future inflation are important is fundamental. Currently, expectations seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end, which is reassuring. The fact that people believe inflation will come down is helpful in achieving that goal.", "'QUESTION': Has the concern about the unwarranted easing of financial conditions eased among members of the Committee?\n'ANSWER': The concern about unwarranted easing of financial conditions is still being monitored carefully. Financial conditions have not changed significantly since the December meeting. It is important for markets to reflect the tightening measures being implemented. There is a difference in perspective on how fast inflation will come down, but the forecast is that it will take time and patience, requiring higher rates for longer."]}
