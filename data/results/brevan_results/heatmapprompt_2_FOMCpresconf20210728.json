Mr. Chairman , I wonder if you might be  able to put some, I don\u2019 t know, numbers or maybe more detail around this concept of \u201csubstantial further progress. \u201d  What counts as the progress numerically, if you will, or , or, or  citing data, if you could, that you cited in the statement today?  And if you could be more specific about what substantial further progress would look like and if that would then lead you to an announcement of an actual reduction in the purchases of your assets.  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Great.  Thank you.  So more deta il on substantial further progress.  So let\u2019s talk about the maximum -employment part of that.  As you know, with maximum employment \u2014unlike with, with  price stability , where we can target a number of 2 percent  on average\u2014with maximum employment, there isn \u2019t a single number that we can target.  That the \u2014we monitor a broad range of , of, of  data about different aspects of the labor market.  There \u2019s unemployment, unemployment among different , different age groups , and such.  There \u2019s participation.  There \u2019s wages.  There \u2019s all kinds of flow data.  And we look at all of it to try to arrive at a picture of what\u2014of what  is maximum employment.  So there isn \u2019t\u2014I can \u2019t give you a , a, a  set of numbers \u2014for example, a numerical threshold like we used for a time back in 2012, I guess it was.  We didn\u2019 t do that here.  What we said was substantial further progress toward our goals.  And what we said was, we would keep,    effectively, we \u2019d\u2014we would give advance  warning as we \u2014and, and, you know, more and more clarity \u2014as, as we move forward.  And that \u2019s what we \u2019re going to try to do. So what would substantial further progress be?  I\u2019d say we have some ground to cover on, on the labor market side.  I think we \u2019re, we\u2019re some way away from , from  having had substantial further progress with , with  max \u2014toward the maximum -employment goal.  I would want to see some strong job numbers.  And , and that \u2019s, that\u2019s  kind of the idea\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If, if I could follow up, you talked about one side of the equation.  You didn\u2019 t\u2014does it mean you feel like you\u2019 ve reached your goal when it comes to the inflation side?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So inflation is running well above our 2 percent  objective and ha s been for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months before we believe it \u2019ll, it\u2019ll  move back down toward our objective.  The question whether we \u2019ve met that objective formally is really one for the Committee to make.  I can \u2019t\u2014I can \u2019t do that by myself.  But it \u2019s clear that, at this time, inflation is actually running above 2  percent.   And , and, again, has been and will be, at least we expect it will, in coming months before returning down toward our target.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hello.  Can you hear me?  [No response]  Hello.  Can you hear me?  I\u2019m sorry.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes, yes.  We can hear you.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.   In your opening statements in March and April, you noted that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent  this year would not meet the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent  for some time, and I noticed you didn\u2019 t repeat that qualification last month or today.  And , and so, in your view, has the rise in inflation this year met the threshold of moderately exceeding 2  percent  for some  time?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  That , that  would, again, be a quest ion for the Committee.  But I would really say , the guidance that you\u2019 re talking about is really the guidance to do with liftoff, right?  That \u2019s\u2014what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions consistent with full employment, infla tion at 2  percent  and on track to run \u2014to run moderately above 2 percent  for some time.  It really isn \u2019t relevant now.  It\u2014because we\u2019 re really \u2014we \u2019re looking at , at tapering asset purchases.  We\u2019re clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates.  It \u2019s not something that, that is on our radar screen right now.  You know, so when we get to that question, when we start to get to the question of , of liftoff, which , which  we are not at all at now or near n ow, that \u2019s when we \u2019ll ask that question.  That is when that , that  will become a real question for us.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about [inaudible] reacting  [inaudible].   You know, does that affect ,    affect how you\u2019 re thinking about tapering?  Does it affect how you \u2019re thinking about, you know, potential liftoff down the road?  And if you could, just talk a little bit about that.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Jeanna, I \u2019m sorry.  For the first 15  seconds of your question, you froze.  Could you\u2014could you say that again?   I apologize.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Oh, ye s.  No.  Sorry.  Ye s.  So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the divergence in global growth and the sort of multispeed recovery we \u2019re seeing around the world impacts how the F ed thinks about its policies.  So do you take into account that sort of multispeed recovery when you\u2019 re thinking about tapering QE, and do you take, take  it into account when you\u2019 re thinking about liftoff?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thanks.  So it \u2019s an\u2014it\u2019s an important feature of this re covery is how uneven it is.  And , in many cases, that \u2019s related to the fact that some countries have had little in the way of access to , to vaccines.  And so they\u2019 re seeing significant outbreaks, and it \u2019s weighing on economic activity, whereas other countries\u2014such as the United States, in particular \u2014are having a very strong rebound.  And , and now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well.  So it\u2019s a feature of our economy.  Now, how does it affect our policy?  In, in a couple of ways, potentially.  One just is that, in general, economies \u2014and through financial markets and through trade \u2014are, are  deeply interconnected now.  And so a stronger global economy will lead to more U .S. exports.  And , and, you know, that \u2019ll help economic activity.   To the extent the  global economy is weak and the United States is strong, it \u2019ll\u2014we \u2019ll wind up , you know, we \u2019ll wind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having , having a lot of exports.  That\u2019s one  way.  Another way, though, is more on the risk side.  And that is, as long as COVID is running loose out there, as long as there \u2019s time and space for the development of new strains, no one\u2019 s    really finally safe.  These , these strains \u2014there \u2019s no reason they just can \u2019t keep coming and one, you know, one more powerful than the next.  We don\u2019 t know that.  But that\u2019 s, that\u2019s, that\u2019s  certainly a plausible outcome.  Now, as , as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our economic activity.  But, you know, it , it is both the right thing to do and, and  very much in our interest to make sure that vaccination happens broadly around the world, just for that reason\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you very much.  Chair Powell, how would you describe the risks to the outlook on inflation at the moment after the last data came out higher than expected?  Do you believe the risks  are, you know, tilted to the upside?  And does the Committee share that view?  Or are they in balance?  Are you s till worried that there could be a hit to demand from, from the Delta variant that could tilt them sort of to the downside again?  If you could give us a sense of that, that would be very helpful.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  I \u2019d be glad to.  So if you look, agai n, if you look at the , the most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected.  But essentially all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories.  It isn \u2019t the kind of inflation that\u2019 s spread broadly across the economy.  It\u2019 s new, used , and rental cars .  It\u2019s airplane tickets .  It\u2019s hotels .  And it\u2019s a couple of other things.  And each of those has a story attached to it that is \u2014that  is really about the reopening of the economy.  So we look at that , and we think that those are temporary things because the , the supply side will respond.  The economy will adapt.  We have a very adaptive, adaptable, flexible economy and labor market.  And it \u2019s a real \u2014a real asset that we have.  And so we think that inflation should move down over time.  Now, we don\u2019 t have any\u2014much confidence, let \u2019s say, in the timing of that or the size of the effects in the near term.  I would say, in the near term, that    the, the, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside.  I , I, I have some confidence in  the\u2014in the medium term, that inflation will move back down.  Again, it \u2019s hard to say when that w ill be. I, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we \u2014inflation is half of our mandate.  Price stability is half of our mandate.  And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently that were\u2014that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were  to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent . So we won \u2019t have an extended period of , of high inflation.  We think that , that  some of it will, will  fall away naturally as the process of reopening the economy moves through.  And it could take some time.   In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure that we do have inflation that averages 2  percent  over time.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Mr. Chairman.  So b ond market pricing seems to suggest that investors think the F ed might eventually overtighten.  So my question is, do you think that markets have bought into the central bank\u2019 s new framework?  And how do you balance that with managing inflation concerns?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, so in terms of what\u2019 s been happening in bond markets, I don\u2019 t think there \u2019s a real consensus on , on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this meeting.  We \u2019ve seen the long- term yields go down significantly.  Some of it is a fall in real yields, which may have been connected to\u2014some speculate \u2014connected to sentiment around the , the spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth.  There was also some decli ne in inflation compensation, which ha s significantly reversed.  And there , there  are also so -called technical factors, which is where you put things that you can \u2019t quite explain.  So I , I, I don\u2019t see in any of that that there is really anything that chal lenges the    credibility of our framework, if, if  that\u2019s really your question.  We are committed to achieving 2 percent  average inflation over time.  What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won\u2019 t be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation.  Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite.  We\u2019ve got, you know, 7 or 8 million people, fewer people , at work than were at work before the  pandemic.  So we \u2019re, you know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  a ways away from full maximum employment.  But we have high inflation, so it \u2019s kind of the opposite case.  And we have to\u2014we have to deal w ith that.  Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad based and likely to be persistent and , and, and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that , that  could cause them to rise.  So we \u2019re monitoring that very carefully, and we \u2019re prepared to use our too ls as appropriate.  But, again, I think our \u2014I think our framework is pretty well  understood.  And , and I think the real test of it will be down the road when it \u2019s time to think about raising interest rates and , and how we assess, assess that set of issues.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks very much, Michelle.  Chairman Powell, you, you  just alluded to the fact that you \u2019re prepared to use your tools to slow the economy down if need be to\u2014if inflation looks like  it\u2019s getting out of control.  I want to just try to understand that in the context of the framework and the forward guidance.  Does that mean you\u2019 d be prepared to raise interest rates even if we\u2019 re not at maximum employment at that point, should you see this danger of inflation?  And , and, two, does it also mean you\u2019 d be prepared to raise interest rates even if you are still buying assets?  Thank you.  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So there \u2019s a\u2014there \u2019s a part in our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals and, and M onetary P olicy S trategy, which, Rich, I \u2019m sure \u2014I\u2019m sure  you\u2019 re familiar with, which , which  talks about that case in which the two goals are in tension.  M ost of the time, if you have high inflation, you also have  high employment \u2014they, they tend to go together.  This is a situation where they \u2019re temporarily in different directions.  We\u2019re not at full employment, but we are having high inflation. We feel like we\u2019 re going to be making good progress over the next \u2014over  the course of the next year, couple of years, really, toward maximum employment.  This is a very strong labor market.  If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it\u2019s\u2014we \u2019re, we\u2019re  clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum .  That, that\u2019s,  that\u2019s the path that we \u2019re on, and, and it shouldn\u2019 t take that long in macroeconomic time to ge t there.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  what I think is , is really the likely case.  And, again, it \u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s not  timely for us to be thinking about , about  raising interest rates right now.  What we\u2019 re doing is , we\u2019re, we\u2019re  looking at our asset purchases and judging what is right for the economy and judging how we \u2014how close we are to substantial further progress and then\u2014and then tapering after that.  The question you asked about , would we raise rates if we hadn \u2019t finished cutting \u2014hadn\u2019 t finished the taper, hypothetica l question.  You know, we \u2019d, we\u2019d face the circumstance at th e time.  We could always just \u2014you know, one thing one could do would be to just cut asset purchases all the way to zero if you wanted to do that.  But it \u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s  just hard to \u2014it\u2019 s hard to answer what you would do without knowing a lot more about the situation.  Ideally, you wouldn\u2019 t be still buying assets and raising rates because, of course, you \u2019re adding    accommodation by buying and, and removing accommodation by raising rates.  So that wouldn\u2019 t be ideal.  I \u2019ll say  that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: So t hank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  Now , so you\u2019 re talking about jobs.  You just said we \u2019re on a path to a very strong job market.  You know, we have 9.5 million people unemployed as of the last labor market survey and 9.2 million job openings.  So what \u2019s the\u2014what \u2019s the disconnect?  Is it a skills gap?  Is it the extended unemployment benefits?  Is it the fact that people just aren \u2019t willing to relocate?  What is the disconnect there?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: It\u2019 s a\u2014it \u2019s a really unusual situation to have \u2014to have the ratio of vacancies to unemployed be this high.  And we think there are a number of things at work there.  Maybe the place to start is, is  just to say that this is n ow not so much about people going back to their old jobs.  It\u2019 s about finding a new job.  So that \u2019s a time- intensive, labor -intensive process.  And there may be a bit of a speed limit on that.  There, there\u2019 s research that suggests that there is a speed lim it on that.  So it \u2019s not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of the recovery going back in a single month because they\u2019 re just going back to their old job.  This is about job selection, things like that.  There may also be some factors th at are \u2014that are holding people back, and that \u2019s\u2014this is what surveys say.  There are people who, who  are reluctant to go back to work because they still feel exposed to COVID.  These could be jobs where , where  there was a lot of , of interaction with the public and where perhaps there \u2019s a family member who \u2019s vulnerable or for whatever reason.  There \u2019s also caretakers who are\u2014where , where  schools are not fully open and parents are at home or taking care of , of, of  older people.  And there \u2019s also been very generous    unemployment benefits, which are now rolling off.  T hey\u2019ll be \u2014they\u2019ll be fully rolled off in a couple of months.  And  all of th ose factors should , should wane.  And, you know, we , we think we should see , because of that, we should see strong job creation moving forward.  I mean, ultimately, it\u2019 s unusual to see aspects like the job openings number in a context where there are that m any unemployed people.  That many job openings would typically suggest a tight labor market.  And, of course, we hear from businesses all over the country that it \u2019s very hard to hire people.  And that may be because people , people are shopping carefully for their next job.  I mean, I , I, I think the bottom line on this is , people want to work.  If you look at where labor force participation can get, people will go back to work unless they retire.  Some people will retire.  But, generally speaking, Americans  want to work, and, and they\u2019 ll find their way into the jobs that they want.  It may take some time, though.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  I wanted to follow up on what you said about there tending to be less in the way of economic implications from each wave of COVID cases.  Could you elaborate on what you\u2019 ve seen to that end during pre vious waves?  And then, looking forward, how vulnerable is the labor market to the Delta variant?  I\u2019m thinking or wondering if you have concerns that jobs that may have come back in travel or tourism could be susceptible if people started reconsidering the ir travel plans or if caretakers were suddenly faced with the prospect of schools not reopening .  How do you see some of those risks going forward?  Thank you so much.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So if you remember the , the summer wave last year of COVID, which was largely southern and w estern states, the economy just performed much better    than anyone expected.  You know, we , we were coming off the spring wave , where there were a lot of shutdowns.  And then this big second wave hit, and I think the natural thing to do is to expect that , that it would have a real impact on the economy.  And i t was much less than , than people thought. People \u2014what \u2019s happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated.  They \u2019re going on with their lives.  Secondly, we \u2019ve kind of lea rned to live with it.  A lot of industries have , have  kind of improvised their way around it \u2014particularly, for example, buying a new home .  That , that process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more of a virtual process.  And so they were able to , you know, to, to do that.  And other industries as well have gone to take -out and, you know, no- contact things.  It \u2019s\u2014so that can all \u2014it seem s like we\u2019 ve learned to , to handle this . Now, I think people would like to get back to, to , you know, the way things were.  And I , I, I hope to some extent, we will over time.  You know, of course, the big wave we had last winter did have significant emplo yment effects, particularly in, you know, hospitality and leisure and other entertainment \u2014other , other  areas with a lot of direct contact.  A lot of jobs were lost then because that was a very strong wave that happened in, in, in the winter months last yea r, just before the vaccines arrived.  So with Delta, we \u2019re just going to have to watch.  Again, with , with, with  a reasonably high percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective \u2014we \u2019re not experts on this \u2014but it , it seems like the\u2014a  good \u2014a good going- in estimate would be that the effects will probably be less.  There probably won\u2019 t be significant lockdowns and things like that.  But, again, those , those  are not decisions for us or , or, or \u2014nor is it something we \u2019re be \u2014we\u2019d be expert in.     In terms of the , the, the  channels, you know, I \u2014this is \u2014this is kind of speculation, but it\u2019s pretty \u2014it just is that people, you could imagine school districts deciding to wait a month or two for the \u2014for the \u2014for the  Delta wave to go .  I\u2019m not saying this \u2019ll happen, but that it \u2019s easy to imagine that.  It\u2019s also easy to imagine that some people might say, you know what?  I \u2019m just going to\u2014I \u2019m just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work.  Wouldn\u2019 t be hard to imagine tha t happening.  If, if schools don\u2019 t open, then caretakers have to stay home.  And if people don\u2019 t go back into the labor force, then the job growth won\u2019 t be as strong, those kinds of things.  So I don\u2019 t\u2014it doesn\u2019 t\u2014it doesn\u2019t \u2014again, sitting here today , not being able to really know the future \u2014it doesn\u2019 t seem as though the effects will be very large.  But there may be effects.  And they\u2014it may be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months \u2014or not.  There are many parts of the country where it might not have an effect, and we \u2019re just going to have to, to see what the economic effects are.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was going to ask if you\u2019 ve started dr afting your Jackson Hole speech, but I \u2019m going to go in a \u2014in a  different direction here.  Steve Liesman ask ed you about semantics.  I\u2019m going to take a cue from him and ask you about the term \u201c transitory ,\u201d because I think of you as somebody who\u2019 s so lucidly explained policies and programs in recent months and made a real concerted effort to explain them to , to the American public as a whole.  I wonder about this term and what you would say to people who don\u2019 t know it definitionally, don \u2019t know what it means , and see prices going up and wonder how long they \u2019re going to have to wait.     So just some broader definition from you\u2014I \u2019d like to hear just about what it means or how you understand it.  And, and quickly a s well, you\u2019 ve talked about vaccines a bit.  And your colleague in Minneapolis has placed a mandate on vaccinating employees coming back to that Federal Reserve Bank.  And I wonder if that \u2019s something that you would like to see or expect to see S ystemwide going forward.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: The concept of \u201ctransitory \u201d is really this:  It is that the increases will happen.  We \u2019re not saying they will reverse.  That \u2019s not what \u201ctransitory \u201d means.  It means that the increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will stop so that \u2014so that there won\u2019 t be further\u2014when , when we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year.  That \u2019s inflation.  When you have inflation for 12 mo nths or whatever it might be \u2014I\u2019m just taking an example ; I\u2019m not making an estimate \u2014then, then  you have a price increase, but you don\u2019 t have an inflation process.  And so part of that just is that, if it doesn \u2019t affect longer- term inflation expectations, t hen it \u2019s very likely not to infect \u2014to affect the process of inflation going forward.  So what , what  I mean by \u201ctransitory \u201d is just something that doesn \u2019t leave a permanent mark on the inflation process.  Again, we don\u2019 t mean \u2014I don\u2019 t mean that,  that, that, t hat, you know, producers are going to take those price increases back.  That\u2019s, that\u2019s  not the idea.  It\u2019s just that they won\u2019 t go on indefinitely.  So to the extent people are , are, are implementing price increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something \u2019s going up, you know, the question,  really , for inflation really is, does that mean they \u2019re going to go up the next year by the same amount?  So you\u2019 re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process , gets going.  And, and that happens because people \u2019s expectations about future inflation move up.  And we don\u2019 t    think that \u2019s happening.  There \u2019s no evidence that it \u2019s happening.  All the evidence is that it\u2019s not happening.  But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is \u2014you know, we have two mandates:   maximum employment and price stability.  Price stability , for us , means inflation averaging 2 percent  over time.  And so we \u2019ve got to be very careful about  that.  But, but I, I, I think it \u2019s a good point that it \u2019s, it\u2019s a term \u2014what it really means is temporary.  But then you\u2019 ve got to understand that it doesn\u2019 t mean that the \u2014that the  increases will be taken back.  Some of them will be, but, but that\u2019s not really what it means.  In terms of \u2014so we \u2019re, we\u2019re  working virtually here, and we \u2019ll be coming back down the road in a couple of months, starting to bring people back here at the B oard of G overnors in Washington.  And, you know, we \u2019re going to follow public health guidance  and things like that.  We really haven \u2019t made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like.  And it\u2019ll depend on, to some extent , on what \u2014on what , you know, CDC guidance  looks like when we actually do bring people back in.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chairman, I want ed to ask you a little bit about your taper timeline in the sense that you said you want a couple more months of data.  And the statement says that the Fed  is going to use \u2014to, to evaluate the developments in the two markets, in jobs and inflation, in coming meetings.  Does that suggest that we wouldn\u2019 t see anything before September or November in your meetings?  And I know a lot of people on Wall Street have basically felt you \u2019re going to lay out your taper plans at Jackson Hole.  Is that \u2014is that the plan, or are we not going to see anything until the fall?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So in any decisions about the timing, and I did not \u2014if I\u2014 if I said we\u2019re looking at wanting a couple more months of data, I wasn\u2019t\u2014I \u2019m not meaning to suggest    anything about a particular time at which we might taper, because we really h ave not made that decision.  All I \u2019m saying is , is, we\u2019re not at substantial further progress.  There \u2019s a range of views on, on what timing will be appropriate.  And those views ultimately track , track  back to people \u2019s views about the economy and, and what  will happen as we make progress toward s, towards our \u2014towards our goal.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  really what it is.  And I , I\u2014we will, of course, as we\u2014you know, we \u2019re going to continue to try to provide clarity as appropriate on, on  timing, pace , and composition.  But, today, I \u2019ve, I\u2019ve  given you what I can give you because, again, this , this  was the first , really , I would say,  deep dive on the issues of timing, pace , and composition.  And it was a good meeting.  And \u2014but no decisions are made, and, and I \u2019m just not in a position to, to give you much guidance, really any guidance , on the actual timing.  I\u2014but I will say we \u2019re making progress.  We expect further progress.  And we expect that, if, if  things go well, then we will \u2014we will reach that goal .  And when we reach it and the Committee is comfortable that we have reached it, then , then we\u2019ll taper at that point.  I can\u2019t, I really \u2014there \u2019s nothing I can say about Jackson Hole.  You know, I \u2019m in\u2014we \u2019re in the process of writing that speech.  And I am going to give a speech, and \u2014but I , I, I wouldn\u2019 t want to \u2014I wouldn\u2019 t want to say what will be in there at this point.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Well, if I could follow up, several people have recently noted that the Fed has got the markets working well.  And you\u2019 ve got bank loans up.  In other words, you\u2019ve stimulated demand.  But savers and companies, like insurance companies and pension funds , are getting hammered by the low rates.  And they\u2019 re wondering if the bal ance hasn \u2019t started to shift away from benefiting the economy to doing more harm than good.  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: W e\u2014asset purchases were just a key part of our response to the critical phase of the crisis.  They , they  really helped us restore market function to these key markets, really, on which\u2014on which , which  are very, very important to our economy and the global economy.  And then they were a big part of , of creating accommodative financial conditions to support demand.  They were strongly needed.  It was that commitment to continue asset purchases that provided strong support for the economy and, and has been a part of the story for why the economy is so strong right now.  So we said we would taper when we \u2014when we  achieve substantial further progres s.  And , and, you know, we \u2019re going to honor that commitment.  I mean, it \u2019s\u2014and, and, again, we \u2019re talking about it right now and meeting by meeting and, and moving in that direction.  We will taper when we reach that goal.  And we \u2019ll provide more , you know, more clarity on that as we go, as is appropriate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  You \u2019ve been asked a lot previously i f the Fed \u2019s monetary policy at all contributes to inequality, but I was really curious to know where you think the Fed \u2019s regulatory policy lands , particularly if you think that the Fed \u2019s bank capital requirements have had the effect of penalizing lower -income households seeking loans.  Basically, is it possible to achieve the balance of a safe banking system with one that also provides equitable loan access?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, I think strong capital requirements are essential for banks, particula rly for the largest banks.  And I think that an undercapitalized banking system, as we \u2019ve seen, can be a real threat to the economy and most \u2014mostly, or to , to the greatest extent, to    people at the lower end of the income spectrum.  So if you look back at not this previous \u2014not this crisis but the previous one, the bank\u2014the banking system was undercapitalized.  So higher capital requirements are , are, you know, are , are really a good thing because they allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform.  I think it \u2019s other tools that we have to \u2014and the Fed has some of these tools, Congress has some of these tools , other agencies have some of these tool s\u2014to assure or support the wide availability of credit, particularly to low - and moderate -income communities.  So that \u2019s CRA.  We enforce CRA.  We\u2019 re working on a \u2014on a  new CRA proposal right now with the other banking agencies, and we think it \u2019s going to be \u2014it\u2019s going to be good and will support the flow of credit to low - and moderate -income households.  It \u2019s also the anti \u2014anti \u2013lending discrimination statutes that we enforce .  And it\u2019s some of the programs that Congress has in place to support the flow of cr edit to low - and moderate -income communities.  I , I don\u2019 t think it\u2019s capital standards at all.  I think capital standards work the other way.  Strong capital is what enables banks to continue to serve their communities, including low - and moderate -income communities.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Thank you for taking my question.  Chair Powell, I guess I wanted to ask about the last \u2014when you were before Congress earlier this month, you mentioned, I think, something along the lines of , it won \u2019t take too long before we see if you\u2019 re right about inflation and its temporary aspect.  You also mentioned learning a lot more in the next six months about the economy.  Can you tell us a li ttle more of what you mean by that?  When do you think you\u2019 ll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions that we \u2019re seeing now ?  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right.  So with inflation, as I mentioned, we\u2019re , we look not just at the headline number , but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation.  And if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that , widely , across the whole range of goods and services that, that are in the economy, we \u2019re seeing  upward , upward pressure on prices.  That \u2019s not really what we \u2019re seeing.  What we\u2019 re seeing is a handful of things that are really \u2014that really account for the , the overshoot of inflation.  And , as I mentioned, it\u2019 s things like cars.  You know, new, used , and rental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage because of the semiconductor shortage.  And housing \u2014sorry, hotels and air , air fares have moved back up, but that really just is retracing the very large downward movement in prices t hat they had before.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a big, big part of , of why the inflation readings are so high.  And those don\u2019t\u2014those , frankly , don \u2019t carry significant implications in the long run for the \u2014for inflation or for the American economy.  So what I said w as, we, we\u2019re going to see whether these things \u2014we don\u2019 t need to see everything do what lumber prices have done.  So if you look at lumber prices, they went up and then they went down. So what we want to see is these other things.  D o they\u2014do they\u2014do the prices flatten out?  Do they actually move down?  If they flatten out, then their , their contribution to inflation becomes zero over time so that they \u2019re not contributing to inflation.  And so, if we start to see those things happen fairly widely among the \u2014among the things that have really moved up quickly, then we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll \u2014they won \u2019t all happen at once or happen quickly\u2014but we \u2019ll know that our basic understanding of the situation is broadly correct.  And I don\u2019 t think it will take , or what I said was , I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 ll take a very long time to see whether that \u2019s the case.  It, it, it  is probably the case that, frankly, the , the overall    reopening of the economy is going to play out over a period of time.   This is a historic, world historical event , that the global economy is now reopening.  It\u2019s not going to\u2014it \u2019s not going to happen quickly.  It \u2019s going to take some time.  And it \u2019s going to be very uneven, as we discussed before.  But I think we will\u2014we will  know, you know, when we know.  But I don\u2019 t think it will take that long.  I don\u2019 t want to put a number on it.  But I do think that , that , if we see those things happening, we \u2019ll know that we have the story basically right.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  I \u2019m just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of how you\u2019 re thinking about mortgage -backed securities purchases as you inch towards taper.  Withi n the context of home prices continuing to rise, we \u2019ve heard a lot of people talk about the idea that maybe they\u2019 d like to cool off on, specifically , the MBS purchases.  Is that more because of the opt ics, or is it because there \u2019s an observed relationship from the Committee \u2019s view between MBS purchases under QE and the hot housing market?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So a number of participants raised that \u2014the questions around MBS and tapering at , at today\u2019 s meeting, as a matter of fact, and yesterday \u2019s meeting.  And I \u2019ll just say that, generally speaking, I don\u2019 t think and\u2014I don\u2019 t think that \u2014I think th at Treasury and MBS purchases affect financial conditions in very similar ways.  There may be modest differences in terms of , of contribution to housing prices, but it \u2019s, it\u2019s not something that \u2019s big. It\u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s\u2014so where I think we are is , there , there  really is little support for the idea of tapering MBS earlier than Treasuries.  I think we will taper them at the same time.  It seems likely, based on where people are now.  The idea of reducing MBS purchases at a somewhat    faster pace than Treasuries does have some attraction for some people \u2014others , not so much.  And I think it \u2019s something that we \u2019ll be continuing to discuss\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you very much.  So I wanted to ask you about the standi ng repo facility and get your sense of what you think it will do for market trading conditions.  And also, kind of in a  similarly  related point, the reverse repo numbers have just gotten even bigger since you raised the reverse repo rate at the last Fed meeting.  And, you know, are you concerned to see, you know, nearly $1 trillion a day, you know, pouring in through that facility?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So  on the standing repo facility, what is it going to do?  So it , it really is a backstop.  So it \u2019s, it\u2019s set at 25  basis points , so out of the money, and it \u2019s, it\u2019s there to help address pressures in money market \u2014money markets that could impede the effectiv e implementation of monetary policy.  So, really, it \u2019s, it\u2019s to support the function of \u2014functioning of monetary policy and its , its effectiveness.  That \u2019s the purpose of it.  And it \u2019s set up with that purpose in mind.  Your question on, on the , the [ON] RRP,  so we think it \u2019s doing what it \u2019s supposed to do, what we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal funds, funds  rate stays within the target range.  You know, it \u2019s essentially , essentially , what \u2019s happening is that it just results in a  lower aggregate amount of Federal Reserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal Reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight R RP balances.  So that , that \u2019s all that \u2019s really happening there.  And we expect it to be high for some time.  It \u2019s being driven, of course, by, by the relatively lower quantity of Treasury bills and, and,    and also  the onset of the debt ceiling and the decline in the TGA, things like that.  So we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019t  have a problem with, with  what it \u2019s doing.  It \u2019s kind of doing the job we expected \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And you don\u2019 t see any issues with, like, disaggregating, you know , markets from, you know, investing in private money market securities?  You know, like , the idea that the Fed\u2019s footprint in money markets is getting too big, you don\u2019 t see any issues there?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Not , not really.  Not at this point.  I mean, money markets, private  money market funds are , are choosing to, to  invest because the rates are attractive.  At some point, the rates will not be so attractive as , as the whole rate cluster normalizes, and , and you\u2019 ll see it shrink back down\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  Chair Powell, I was going to go back to inflation a little bit.  I \u2019m just kind of surprised by your tone.  It , it seems like you \u2019re just sort of warning that, if inflation gets too high, you know, the Fed  will act.  Isn\u2019t it true that, I mean, a little inf lation is good for the economy and, and that we \u2014if somehow maybe we can get the economy out of this sort of place where we \u2019re always going to be  close to the zero lower bound, i sn\u2019t there a good story to tell,  and you\u2019 re sort of panicking people?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I certainly don \u2019t, don\u2019t  have that in mind.  No.  Look, we\u2014as you know, we \u2019re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2  percent  inflation for some time.  We, we want inflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent .  We feel like they may be a little bit below that.  So the bigger picture is that, you know, that , that, that  would be a healthy thing.  This is a different thing.  This is \u2014this is not that.  Th at was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from, you know , from a very, very strong labor market and a \u2014and a  booming    economy maybe.  T hat, that was the kind of inflation \u2014this, this  is something different.  This is really driven by the s upply side, which is not able to hand\u2014to handle this big spike in demand that we \u2019re seeing.  As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary policy support, the supply side \u2014just all over the world , you\u2019 re seeing the same thing, whic h is, it just can \u2019t keep up.  And there are labor shortages in , in a lot of places, the same sort of thing.  So, you know, there \u2019s, there\u2019s absolutely no sense of panic.  I just\u2014 I\u2019ve explained, I think, several times here today that the best\u2014 my, my best estimate is that this is something that will pass.  It\u2019s really a shock to the economy that w ill pass through.  And, you know, if you\u2014if you look at where forecasters are\u2014 people who actually write down a forecast for a living\u2014very, very strongly they see it that way.  Now, we \u2014but, you know , are\u2014we \u2019re actually responsible for this, though, so we have to take seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might actually move inflation expectations up, and that  we might \u2014that the kind of things that might require a response.  We, again, we don\u2019 t see that now.  But we , we have to be on the alert for it.  And people have to understand and believe that we will react if , if we need to.  And we will.  But, again, it \u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s not my base case.  My base case is that \u2014is, as I \u2019ve said repeatedly, is that inflation will move back down.  And no, w e\u2019re not \u2014we , we have not at all changed our view, and I haven\u2019 t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent , moderately above 2 percent , is a desirable thing.  This is not moderately above 2 percent .  This is well above 2  percent .  But it \u2019s also not the kind of inflation we were looking for.  This  is really driven by a supply- side shock\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  I wonder if you could talk about wages.  Many workers seem to have gotten some good wage gains in, in recent months.  What ca n workers generally expect going forward?  And it doesn \u2019t sound like you\u2019 re concerned about rising wages feeding into broader inflation .  Is that right?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So wages have moved up.  A lot of that is driven by new hires.  And it\u2019s\u2014a lot of it is driven at relatively low -paid jobs in the service industries as people come back.  So that \u2019s not troubling.  And we , we don\u2019t see\u2014 there , there  is a form of wage inflation that can lead to price inflation, and we \u2019re not seeing that r ight now. And that really is if what we call \u201c unit labor costs \u201d move up and, and, and, which really puts\u2014move up in a way that is \u2014that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices.  Now, when it happens gradually, when that \u2014if you \u2014we \u2019ve seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor costs do move up and, and  put some pressure on margins .  In a long expansion, that \u2019s been happening late in the expansion.  That \u2019s not a problem, either. The problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices.  It was called the \u201c wage \u2013price spiral. \u201d  We don\u2019 t see that now.  This is something that was a featur e of the high inflationary era of the G reat Inflation, but it \u2019s not a feature now.  And w e don \u2019t see that now.  Of course, we \u2019ll be watching it.  And this is one of the reasons why we \u2019re watching so carefully to see whether labor force \u2014whether people do com e back and accept jobs.  Given the very large number of job openings and the  very large number of unemployed people, we \u2019d like to see, you know, those \u2014   some matching going on there so people get back to work.

Despite improvements in the labor market, there is still a long way to go, as factors related to the pandemic continue to weigh on employment growth.Inflation has increased and is expected to remain elevated in the coming months due to supply bottlenecks and base effects, but as these transitory effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back towards the longer-run goal. However, the unprecedented process of reopening the economy could lead to higher and more persistent inflation if supply constraints persist.Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19, but the pace of vaccinations has slowed and the Delta strain is spreading quickly in some areas. Continued progress on vaccinations would support a return to more normal economic conditions, and the Fed's policy actions have been guided by their mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices, as well as their responsibilities to promote financial system stability.The FOMC discussed the progress made towards their goals and reviewed considerations for adjusting asset purchases based on economic conditions. They will continue to assess the economy's progress and provide advance notice before making any changes. Additionally, they announced the establishment of two standing repo facilities to support monetary policy implementation and emphasized their commitment to supporting the economy until the recovery is complete.The speaker expresses anticipation for the audience's inquiries.", "question_answer_summary": ["QUESTION: Can you provide more details on what constitutes \"substantial further progress\" and what data you consider when assessing maximum employment?\n\nANSWER: Maximum employment is not defined by a single number, but rather a range of data on various aspects of the labor market such as unemployment, participation, wages, and flow data. There is no specific numerical threshold, but we will provide advance warning and increasing clarity as we make progress. Strong job numbers are needed to achieve substantial further progress.", "'QUESTION': Do you feel like you've reached your goal when it comes to inflation?\n'ANSWER': Inflation is currently running well above our 2 percent objective and is expected to remain above it for a few months before moving back down. The formal determination of whether we have met the objective is for the Committee to make, but it is clear that inflation is currently above 2 percent and is expected to stay that way for some time.", "'QUESTION': Can you hear me?\n'ANSWER': Yes, yes. We can hear you.", "'QUESTION': Has the rise in inflation this year met the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for some time?\n'ANSWER': That question is for the Committee to decide. The guidance regarding inflation exceeding 2 percent is mainly relevant for liftoff, which is not our current focus. We are currently focused on tapering asset purchases and raising interest rates is not on our radar. When we reach the liftoff stage, that question will become relevant.", "QUESTION: Does [inaudible] reaction affect the thinking about tapering and potential liftoff?\nANSWER: Chair Powell asks the reporter to repeat the question as the first part was inaudible.", "'QUESTION': How does the divergence in global growth and the multispeed recovery impact the Fed's policies on tapering QE and liftoff?\n'ANSWER': The uneven recovery, caused by limited access to vaccines in some countries, affects the Fed's policies in two ways. Firstly, a stronger global economy leads to more US exports, boosting economic activity. Secondly, the risk of new COVID strains remains as long as the virus is present globally, highlighting the importance of widespread vaccination.", "'QUESTION': How would you describe the risks to the outlook on inflation after the recent higher-than-expected data? Are the risks tilted to the upside? Is the Committee worried about a hit to demand from the Delta variant?\n'ANSWER': The recent inflation report showed higher-than-expected inflation, but it is mainly driven by a few categories related to the reopening of the economy. We believe these are temporary and that inflation will move down over time. In the near term, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside, but in the medium term, we expect inflation to decrease. If inflation persists above our goal, we will use our tools to guide it back down to 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': Do you think that markets have bought into the central bank's new framework? And how do you balance that with managing inflation concerns?\n'ANSWER': There is no consensus on the recent moves in bond markets. The decline in long-term yields may be due to factors such as sentiment around the Delta variant and technical factors. Our framework remains credible, and we are committed to achieving 2 percent average inflation. We are monitoring inflation carefully and will use our tools as appropriate. The real test of our framework will be when it's time to think about raising interest rates.", "'QUESTION': Would the Federal Reserve be prepared to raise interest rates even if maximum employment has not been reached, in order to address inflation?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve acknowledges that there may be a situation where inflation and employment goals are in tension. Currently, there is high inflation but not full employment. However, the Fed expects to make progress towards maximum employment in the next year or two. It is not timely to consider raising interest rates now, but the Fed will assess asset purchases and taper accordingly. The hypothetical scenario of raising rates before completing the taper is difficult to answer without more information, but ideally, the Fed would not be buying assets and raising rates simultaneously.", "'QUESTION': What is causing the disconnect between the high number of job openings and the high number of unemployed people?\n'ANSWER': The high ratio of job vacancies to unemployed individuals is an unusual situation. It is not just about people returning to their old jobs, but about finding new jobs, which is a time-consuming process. Factors such as concerns about COVID exposure, caretaking responsibilities, and generous unemployment benefits have also contributed. However, as these factors diminish, strong job creation is expected in the future.", "QUESTION: Could you elaborate on the economic implications of previous waves of COVID and how vulnerable the labor market is to the Delta variant?\n\nANSWER: Previous waves of COVID had less impact on the economy than expected due to vaccination and adaptation in industries. The winter wave last year had significant employment effects, but with a high vaccination rate, the effects of the Delta variant may be less severe. However, there could still be potential disruptions in the labor market if schools delay reopening or if people choose to wait before returning to work. The overall economic effects are uncertain and will depend on various factors.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain what you mean by \"transitory\" in relation to inflation and how it affects the inflation process going forward? Also, do you expect a systemwide mandate on vaccinating Federal Reserve Bank employees?\n'ANSWER': \"Transitory\" means that while there will be price increases, it does not imply a continuous inflation process. It does not mean that price increases will be reversed. If price increases do not affect long-term inflation expectations, they are unlikely to impact the inflation process going forward. As for vaccination mandates, no decisions have been made yet.", "'QUESTION': Does the statement suggest that we won't see any tapering decisions before September or November? Will the taper plans be laid out at Jackson Hole?\n'ANSWER': The timing of tapering decisions has not been determined yet. The decision will depend on the progress towards our goals and the views on the economy. Clarity on timing, pace, and composition will be provided as appropriate, but no guidance can be given at this point. The speech at Jackson Hole is being written, but its content cannot be disclosed yet.", "'QUESTION': Are the low interest rates benefiting the economy or causing harm to savers and companies like insurance companies and pension funds?\n'ANSWER': Asset purchases were necessary to restore market function and create accommodative financial conditions to support demand during the crisis. The commitment to continue asset purchases has been a key factor in the strong economy. The Fed will taper when substantial further progress is achieved and will provide more clarity on the timing.", "'QUESTION': Is it possible to achieve a balance between a safe banking system and equitable loan access?\n'ANSWER': Strong capital requirements are essential for banks, particularly the largest ones, to prevent undercapitalization that can harm the economy, especially low-income individuals. Higher capital requirements allow banks to weather downturns. Other tools, such as the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and anti-lending discrimination statutes, along with programs from Congress, support the availability of credit to low- and moderate-income communities. Capital standards enable banks to serve their communities, including low- and moderate-income ones.", "QUESTION: When do you think you'll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions that we're seeing now?\n\nANSWER: Chair Powell stated that they look at all components of inflation and not just the headline number. They are seeing upward pressure on prices in a handful of areas like cars, hotels, and airfares, but these factors do not carry significant implications for long-term inflation. They will know if their understanding is correct when they see these prices flatten out or move down. It is expected that the reopening of the economy will take time and be uneven.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide more information on how the Federal Reserve is considering mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchases as they approach tapering, particularly in relation to the hot housing market?\n'ANSWER': There were discussions about MBS and tapering at the recent meetings. While there may be slight differences in their impact on housing prices, overall, MBS and Treasury purchases affect financial conditions similarly. There is little support for tapering MBS earlier than Treasuries, and it is likely that they will be tapered at the same time. The idea of reducing MBS purchases at a faster pace than Treasuries has some appeal to some participants, but it is still being discussed.", "'QUESTION': What is the purpose of the standing repo facility and the reverse repo numbers?\n'ANSWER': The standing repo facility is a backstop set at 25 basis points to address pressures in money markets that could impede monetary policy implementation. The reverse repo numbers help provide a floor for money market rates and ensure the federal funds rate stays within the target range. It results in a lower amount of reserves in banks and a higher amount in money market funds.", "'QUESTION': And you don't see any issues with the Fed's footprint in money markets getting too big?\n'ANSWER': Not really. Money market funds are choosing to invest because the rates are attractive. As rates normalize, the attractiveness will decrease and the size of the Fed's footprint in money markets will shrink.", "'QUESTION': Are you panicking about inflation and causing unnecessary concern?\n'ANSWER': No, we are not panicking. We are targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation and want inflation expectations to be centered on that. The current inflation is driven by a supply-side shock and we believe it will pass. However, we are prepared to respond if necessary.", "'QUESTION': What can workers generally expect in terms of wages going forward and is there concern about rising wages leading to broader inflation?\n'ANSWER': Wages have increased, largely driven by new hires in low-paid service jobs as people return to work. This is not concerning, as we are not seeing a form of wage inflation that leads to price inflation. We are monitoring the situation closely and would like to see more people accepting jobs to ensure a healthy labor supply. Overall, wages increasing in line with inflation and productivity is positive."]}
