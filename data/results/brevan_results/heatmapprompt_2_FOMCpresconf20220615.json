Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Two related questions .  Chair Powell , do you feel you boxed yourself in with the language you used at the last press conference on 50 basis point hikes in June and July ?  And would you please give us as detailed a sense as you can of what role you played in reshaping market expectations so quickly on Monday?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we can about our  policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook, because we think monetary policy is more effective when market participants understand how policy will evolve, when they understand our objective function, our reaction function.  And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it \u2019s helpful to provide even more clarity than usual \u2014again , subject to uncertainty in the outlook.  And I think over the course of this year , financial markets  have responded and have , generally, shown that they understand the path we \u2019re laying out.  Of course , it remains data dependent .     And so that \u2019s what we generally think about guidance , and that \u2019s why we offer it.  And , of course , when we offered that \u2014when I offered that guidance at the last meeting, I did say that it was subject to the economy performing about i n line with expectations.  I also said that if the economy performed\u2014if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even more ag gressively.  So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last week, and we thought for a while , and we thought , well , this is the appropriate thing to do.  So then the question is, what do you do?  And do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting?  And I think the answer is , that \u2019s not where we are with this.  So we decided we needed to go ahead , and so we did.  And that \u2019s really \u2014that \u2019s really how we made the decision.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks for taking our questions.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.   You \u2014I guess I wonder if you could describe for us a little bit how you\u2019re deciding how aggressive you need to be.  So , obviously, 75 today.  W hat did 75 achieve that 50 wouldn\u2019 t have , and why not just go for a full percentage point at some point?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Sure.  So if you take a step back, what we \u2019re looking for is compelling evidence that inflationary pressur es are abating and that inflation is moving back down.  A nd we \u2019d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings \u2014that\u2019s what we \u2019re looking for.  And , by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear signs of at least inflation flattening out and , ideally , beginning to decline.  We\u2019ve said that we \u2019d be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attentive to inflation risks \u2014the things tha t I mentioned to Howard moments ago.  So contrary to expectations, inflation again surprised to the upside .  Indicators \u2014some indicators of inflation expectations have risen , and projections of [inflation] this year have    moved up notably.  So we thought that  strong action was warranted at this meeting , and today we delivered that in the form of a 75 basis point rate hike , as I mentioned.  So the point of it, really , is this :  We\u2019ve been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels , and over the course of the seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we \u2019ve seen financial conditions tighten, and appropriately so.  But the federal f unds r ate, even after this move, is at 1.6 percent .  So, again , the Committee is moving rates up exped itiously to more normal levels , and we came to the view that we\u2019 d like to do a little more front- end loading on that.  So I think that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time.  This was really about the speed in which we would get there.  So, as I mentioned, 75 basis points today\u2014I said the next meeting could well be about a decision between 50 and 75.  T hat would put us , at the end of the July meeting , in that range \u2014in that more normal range , and that \u2019s a desirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with which you would proceed going forward. Just talking about the SEP for a second:   What it really says is that Committee participants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restricted \u2014restrictive level at the end of this year .  And that \u2019s six months from now , and so much data [can accrue] and so much can happen, s o remember how highly uncertain this is .  But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3 \u00bd percent.  Tha t\u2019s where people are, and that \u2019s what they want to see, knowing what they know now and understanding that we need to be \u2014we need to show resolve  but also be flexible [in responding] to incoming data as we see it.  If things are better, we don \u2019t need to do t hat much, and if they\u2019 re not , then we either do that much or possibly even more.  But in any case, it will be very data dependent.  Then you\u2019 re looking at next year , and what you\u2019 re seeing is, people see more \u2014a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3\u00bd to 4 percent.  And that \u2019s generally what    people see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and getting back down to 2 percent.  So  75 basis points seemed like the right thing to do at this meeting , and that \u2019s what we did.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Liesman, CNBC .  Thank you for taking my question, Mr. Chairman.  You have not used the phrase in a long time \u201c monetary policy is in a good place,\u201d  which is a phrase that you used to use often.  Now that the Committee is projecting 4 percent on a\u2014or 3.8 percent next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is now, the futures market of 4 percent funds rate next year, do you think that \u2019s a level that is going to be sufficie ntly high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem?  And just as a follow -up, could you break that apart for me?  How much of that is restrictive , and how much of that is a normal positive rate that ought to be e mbedded or not , in your opinion, in the funds rate? Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure .  So the question really is , how high does the rate really need to go?  And this is \u2014the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3 \u00bd to 4 percent.  And how do you think about that?  Well, you can think about the longer -run neutral rate, you can compare it to that, and we think that \u2019s in the mid -2s.  You can look, frankly, at broader financial conditions.  You can look at asset prices, you can look at the effect they \u2019re having on the economy, rates, asset prices, credit spreads\u2014all of those things go into that.  You can also look at the yield curve and ask, all along the yield curve, where is the policy rate?  So for much of the yield curve now, real ra tes are positive.  That \u2019s not true at the short end .  At the short end of the yield curve in the early  years, you don\u2019 t have real \u2014you have negative rates still.     So that really is one data point \u2014it\u2019s  one part of financial conditions.  So I think\u2014I have to look at it this way:   We move the policy rat e.  That affects financial conditions .  And that affects the economy.  We have , of course , ways \u2014rigorous ways to think about it, but , ultimately , it comes down to , do we think financial conditions are in a place w here they \u2019re having the desired effect on the economy?  And that desired affect is , we\u2019d like to see demand moderating.  Demand is very hot still in the economy.  W e\u2019d like to see the labor market getting better in balance between supply and demand , and that can happen [as a result of developments coming] both from supply and demand.  Right now , there \u2019s\u2014demand is substantially higher than available supply , though, so we feel that there \u2019s a role for us in moderating demand.  Those are the things we can affect with our policy tools.  There are many things we can\u2019 t affect, and those would be , you know, the things \u2014the commodity price issues that we \u2019re having around the world due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that, and also just all of the suppl y-side things that are still pushing upward on inflation.  So that \u2019s really how I think \u2014how I think about it\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: But does 3.8 percent, 4 percent get it done?  Does it get the job done on breaking the back of inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I think it \u2019s certainly in the range of plausible numbers.  I think we \u2019ll know when we get there really.  I mean , honestly,  though, that would be \u2014you would have positive real rates , I think , and inflation coming down by then.  I think you\u2019 d have positive real rates across the [yield] curve .  I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days.  So I would think it would, but you know what ?  We\u2019re going to find that out empirically .  We\u2019re not going to be completely model driven about thi s.  We\u2019re going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes open, and reacting to incoming data both on financial conditions and on what \u2019s happening in the economy.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks .  Nick Timiraos.  Chair Powell, you\u2019 ve said that you like your policy to work through expectations .  And now , obviously, this decision was something quite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during the intermeeting period.  And I know you just said that wha t changed was really the inflation data\u2014the inflation expectations data .  But I\u2019m wondering, on the inflation expectations data, was there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing somethi ng so different from what you had \u201csocialized \u201d before?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations \u2014so you\u2019 ve got the public, you\u2019 ve got surveys of the public and of experts , and you\u2019 ve also got market based.  And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place, where short -term inflation is going to be high but comes down sharply over the next couple  of years.  And that \u2019s really where inflation expectations are.  And also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2 percent.  And so this is really very important to us \u2014that that remain  the case.  And I think if you look for most measures, most of the time, that \u2019s what you see.  If we even see a couple of indicators that bring that into question, we take that very seriously.  We do not take this for granted\u2014we take it very seriously.  So the preliminary Michigan [survey] reading\u2014it \u2019s a preliminary reading ; it might be revised \u2014nonetheless, it was quite eye- catching, and we noticed that.  We also noticed that the index of c ommon i nflation e xpectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time, so we \u2019re watching t hat, and we \u2019re thinking, \u201ct his is something we need to take seriously.\u201d   And that is one of the factors , as I mentioned\u2014o ne of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations.  We \u2019re    absolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2 percent.  That was one of the reasons \u2014the other was just the CPI r eading.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: So if you saw a movement like that again, another tick- up in inflation expectations, would that put a 75 or even 100 basis point increase in play at your next meeting?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: We\u2019 re going to \u2014I\u2019ll just say , we\u2019re going to react to the incoming data and appropriate ly, I think.  So I wouldn\u2019 t want to put a number on what that might be.  The main thing is to get rates  up, and then pretty soon, we \u2019ll be in an area where we\u2019 re\u2014I think as you get closer to the end of the year, you\u2019 re in a range where you\u2019 ve got restrictive policy, which is appropriate .  Forty- year highs in inflation \u2014we think th at policy is going to need t o be restrictive, and we don\u2019 t know how restrictive.  So I think that \u2019s how we \u2019ll take it.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin from Axios .  Thanks for taking our questions.  The late -breaking kind of decision to go to 75 basis points \u2014do you worry that that will make policy guidance a less effective tool in the future ?  And should we think of that as a kind of symmetrical reaction function if we start to get soft readings on inflation or if the labor market starts to roll o ver?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: To take your second question first, yes .  I mean , I think we \u2019re\u2014again, we \u2019re going, we \u2019re resolved to take this on , but we \u2019re going to be flexible in the implementation of it.  Sorry \u2014and your [first] question was [about] guidance.  So,  again, the overall exercise is that we try to be \u2014provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better.  There\u2019 s always a trade off, because you have to live with that guidance , and so you do it,  and it helps a lot of the time.  I ,    frankly , think this year has been a demonstration of how well it can work.  With us having really just done very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite significantly through the expectations channel, as we \u2019ve made it clear what our plans are.  So I think that \u2019s been a very healthy thing to be happening.  A nd I would hope that our \u2014it\u2019s always going to be \u2014any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things w orking out about as we expect.  And , in this particular situation, you know, we \u2019re looking for something specific, and that is progress on inflation.  We want to see progress.  W e want to see \u2014inflation can\u2019t go down until it flattens out , and that \u2019s what we \u2019re looking to see.  And if we don\u2019 t see that, then that \u2019s the kind of thing that will \u2014even if we don\u2019 t see progress for a longer period, that could cause us to react.  But we will .  Soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some point.  And w e\u2019ll react [as] appropriate to that , too.  But I would like to think, though , that our guidance is still credible , but it \u2019s always going to be conditional on what happens.  This is an unusual situation, to get , you know, some data late in , during blackout, pretty close to \u2014very close to our meeting.  Very unusual to [have] one  that would actually change the outcome .  So I\u2019ve only seen\u2014in my 10 -years -plus here at the Fed, I\u2019ve only seen something like that, even close to that, one or two times.  So I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s something that \u2019ll come up a great deal.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you so much for taking our questions.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times.  On the \u201c clear and convincing\u201d  threshold for the inflation trajectory, what is the level of realized inflation that meets that criteria ?  And how is the Committee thinking about the potential tradeoff of much higher unemployment than even in what \u2019s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at this acceptable pace?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: The second par t I didn\u2019t get.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: W hat\u2019s the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment than even what \u2019s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating a t an acceptable pace?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right .  So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation, and we \u2019d like to see inflation headed down.  B ut, you know \u2014and right now, our policy rate is well below neutral, right?   So, soon enough, we \u2019ll have our policy rate \u2014let\u2019s assume the world works out about like  the SEP says:  T he policy rate will be up where we think it should be .  And then the question would be :  Do you slow dow n?  Does it make you \u2014you\u2019ll be making these judgments about , is it appropriate now to slow down\u2014from 50 to 25, let\u2019s say \u2014or speed up?   So that \u2019s the kind of thinking we \u2019ll be doing, and , again, we \u2019re looking\u2014ultimately , we\u2019re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling ev idence , that inflation is coming down.  A nd that \u2019s what I mean by\u2014that \u2019s what it would take for us to say, \u201cO kay, we think this job is done.\u201d   Because we saw\u2014and, frankly, we saw last year \u2014inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turned  right around and went back up.  So I think we \u2019re going to be careful about declaring victory.  But our \u2014again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and s ensitive to incoming data.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation, it\u2019 s going to require more than just some pain at this point?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Again, I think that \u2014I do think that our objective , and this is what \u2019s reflected in the SEP, but our objective , really , is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong.  I think that what \u2019s becoming more clear is that many factors that we don\u2019 t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that \u2019s possible or not.  And there I \u2019m thinking , of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain    [developments] , things like that , where we really \u2014the monetary polic y stance doesn \u2019t affect those things .  But having said that, there is a path for us to get there \u2014it\u2019s not getting easier ; it\u2019s getting more challenging because of these external forces\u2014and that path is to move demand down, and you have a lot of surplus demand.  T ake, for example , in the labor market.  So you have two job vacancies,  essentially , for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating.  You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level , and you wouldn\u2019 t\u2014you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that\u2019 s consistent with 2 percent infla tion.  So that \u2019s a possibility .  And you could say the same thing about some of the product markets where there \u2019s just excess capacity and really where the strong demand has gone into\u2014sorry , where they \u2019re capacity constrained, right?  So you have , effectiv ely, what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it .  So demand comes in , and it\u2019s very strong , and it shows up in higher prices \u2014not  higher quantities, not more cars, because they can \u2019t make the cars because they don \u2019t have the semiconductors.  So in principle , that could work in reverse .  When demand comes down, you could see \u2014and it \u2019s not guaranteed \u2014but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest , because of the unusual situation we \u2019re in on the supply side.  So there \u2019s a pathway there.  It is not going to be easy, and there \u2014again , it\u2019s our objective , but, as I mentioned, it \u2019s going to depend to some extent on factors we don\u2019 t control.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  T hank you for taking our questions.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  So the new projections show the unemployment rate ticking up through 2024.

Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So  you\u2019 re right .  In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to 4 point \u2014the me dian is 4.1  percent \u2014of course , [there is] a range  of actual forecasts.  And I would characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know , on its way down to 2 percent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that \u2019s still a historically low level.   We hadn \u2019t seen \u2014we hadn\u2019t seen  rates, unemployment rates below 4  percent until a couple years ago for \u2014we \u2019d seen it for , like , one year in the last 50.  So the idea that \u20143.6 percent is historically low in the last century.  So a 4.1 percent unemployment ra te with inflation well on its way to 2 percent \u2014I think that would be \u2014I think that would be a successful outcome.  So we \u2019re not looking to have a higher unemployment rate .  But I would say that I would certainly look at that as a successful outcome.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Would that include people losing their jobs?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: We\u2019 re not \u2014again, we \u2019re not, we don\u2019 t seek to put people out of work, of course .  We never think , \u201cToo many people are working, and fewer people need to have jobs.\u201d  But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability.  And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market , and that \u2019s a labor market where workers are getting wage increases\u2014 maybe the workers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases, as they were before the pandemic \u2014where participation is high, where there \u2019s lots of job opportunities, where it\u2019s just a really \u2014I mean , the labor market we  had before the pandemic was\u2014that \u2019s what we want to get back to.  And you see disparities between various groups at historic lows.  We\u2019 d love to get back to that place.  But, to get there \u2014it\u2019s not going to happen with the levels of inflation    we have.  So w e have to restore that , and it really is in service , in the medium and longer term , of the kind of labor market we want and hope to achieve.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And given the new projections for the unemployment rate, could you talk a little bit about what accounts for such reduced confidence against , say, a month ago or three months ago that inflation will largely normalize on its own as these supply- side issues get worked out?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well , yeah, I think you\u2019 ve seen \u2014ag ain, we \u2019ve been expecting progress , and we didn\u2019 t get that.  W e got sort of the opposite .  So I also think the situation, really \u2014since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you \u2019re seeing is the situation getting more difficul t.  And you look around the world\u2014I mean , lots of countries are \u2014lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it \u2019s largely due to commodities prices.  But all over the world , you\u2019 re seeing these e ffects.  And so\u2014and we \u2019re seeing them here:  g as prices at  all-time highs , and things like that .  That\u2019s not something we can do something about.  So that is really \u2014and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations.  People \u2014the public \u2019s expectations, why would they be distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation?   Core inflation is something we [on the Committee] think a bout because it is a better predictor of future inflation.  But headline inflation is what people experience .  They don\u2019 t know what core is.  Why would they?  They have no reason to.  So that \u2019s\u2014expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflat ion.  So it\u2019s become\u2014the environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five months , and hence the need for the policy actions that we took today.  Hence our resolution to get rates up and, ultimately , get them to where we think they need to be in coming months.   \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks , Chair Powell.  Edward Lawrence with F ox Business.  I want ed to ask you\u2014you talked about CPI going to 8.6 percent, that  retail sales surprised the market by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down.  Are you hearing from contacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we \u2019re, of course , watching very, very carefully for that and looking at the retail\u2014 the big store numbers and all that  kind of thing.  A nd so I \u2014but I think the fair summary of what we see is, you see continuing shifts in consumption, you see some things getting\u2014sales going down, but overall spending is very strong.  The consumer \u2019s in really good shape financial ly.  T hey\u2019re spending.  There \u2019s no sign of a broader  slowdown that I can see in the economy.  People are talking about it a lot \u2014consumer confidence is very low.  That \u2019s probably related to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people.  But that\u2019 s what  we\u2019re seeing.  We\u2019 re not seeing a broad slowdown.  We see job growth slowing, but it \u2019s still at quite robust levels.  We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels \u2014healthy growth levels.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  So then as you are raising rates in thi s economy, how closely are you watching consumer spending, or is there something \u2014another indicator that you \u2019re watching more closely?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: It would be hard to watch  anything much more closely than we watch consumer spending, but we watch everythi ng.  We watch business fixed investment, which actually has softened a bit .  And we watch \u2014we \u2019re responsible for watching everything .  Consumption is 60- some percent of the economy, two -thirds  of the economy, so, naturally , we spend a lot of time on that.  And , again, there \u2019s a lot going on \u2014there are a lot of flows back and    forth \u2014but , ultimately , it does appear that the U.S. economy is in a strong position and well  positioned to deal with higher interest rates.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation?  In other words, how far would you chase oil prices if they keep going up?  If that \u2019s going to be the component that drives expectations, would you risk recession for a headline rate if the core rate is holding steady or starting to go down?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So the \u2014we \u2019re responsible for inflation in the law.  And inflation means headline i nflation.  So that \u2019s our ultimate goal.  We, of course, like all central b anks do, look very, very carefully at core inflation because it is \u2014it\u2019s a much better predictor , and it \u2019s much\u2014it \u2019s a much better predictor of where inflation is going , and it \u2019s also  more relevant to our tools.  As I mentioned, the parts that don\u2019 t go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tool s, so we look at that.  But it \u2019s\u2014the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I mentioned about expectations .  We can \u2019t affect, really \u2014I mean , the energy prices are set by global commodity prices .  And most of food\u2014not all of it, but most food prices are pretty heavily influenced by global commodity prices , too.  Also other things.  So we can \u2019t really have much of an effect .  But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations [coming] from headline  [inflation readings] .  So it\u2019 s a very difficult situation to be in , and we \u2014again, we can \u2019t do much about the difference between [h eadline and core inflation rates due to] the elements that make up headline that are not in core.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Could I just, as a follow -up, get a clarification on the SEP ?  When the members gave their forecasts, when were they inserted into the record ?  Were they revised    after the CPI or Michigan numbers came out?  In other words, does the SEP , as we have it now , reflect the same factors that led you to go to a 75 basis point move?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: The SEP is of one piece .  It reflects all of the economic  readings .  It also reflects the 75 basis point increase.  This is important.  So people had that in hand when they\u2014when their SEPs were submitted.  So it \u2019s\u2014in other words, it \u2019s not in addition to what \u2019s in the SEP.

I wanted to ask about how you\u2019re measuring progress, especially since you\u2019 ve now started front -loading rate hik es more.  You\u2019ve talked about how you want to see inflation coming down over a series of reports , and I guess I \u2019m curious whether you think inflation data itself is a really good indicator or whether you might be concerned that it \u2019s a lagging indicator or that it might send confusing signals given that , as you\u2019 ve talked about, there are sort of supply and demand aspects .  And I guess my question is, do you think that inflation will tell you \u2014inflation data will tell you when you\u2019 ve gone to where you need to go, or do you just feel like maybe it \u2019s better to overshoot than to undershoot? \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I think the role that we can play\u2014maybe the way to get at this is to say that the role that we can play is around demand, right?  A nd we \u2019ll be able to see\u2014th e areas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand , and we \u2019ll be able to see our effect on , for example, job openings in real  time.  And that would tell us what \u2019s\u2014that would tell us about wages.  Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we \u2019re seeing , but, going forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector .  Sorry, I \u2019m not sure I \u2019m getting to your question.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: My question is, is inflation data itself the best ind icator for when you\u2019re getting to where you need to go, or might it lead you to go too far?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: There \u2019s always a risk of going too far or going not far enough, and it\u2019s going to be a very difficult judgment to make, or maybe not \u2014maybe it \u2019ll be really clear .  But we\u2019re\u2014and we \u2019re quite mindful of the dangers.  But I will say , the worst mistake we could make would be to fail, which \u2014it\u2019 s not an option.  We have to restore price stability .  We really do, because everything \u2014it\u2019s the bedrock of the economy.  If you don\u2019 t have price stability, the economy\u2019 s really not going to work the way it \u2019s supposed to.  It won \u2019t work for people \u2014their wages will be eaten up.  So we want to get the job done.  This inflation happened relatively recently .  We don\u2019 t think that it\u2019 s affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way.  We don\u2019t think that we \u2019re seeing a wage \u2013price spiral.  We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent , and that \u2019s critical.  It \u2019s absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence.  So that \u2019s how we \u2019re thinking about it.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  I just want to expand, I guess , on what you just said now about the general public feeling like you can get this done.  You talk about consumer sentiment being down, also inflation expectations being up, recession just broadly being dinner table talk.  Does the general feel among American households and also businesses square with your e xplanation of the economy, given that the description of inflation in the statement didn \u2019t change between May and June?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, clearly , people don\u2019 t like inflation \u2014a lot.  And many people are experiencing it , really , for the first time , because we haven \u2019t had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years .  And it\u2019s really something people don\u2019 t like .  And they\u2019 re experiencing that ,    and that \u2019s showing up in their \u2014in surveys and in all kinds of ways.  And we understa nd that , and we understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation, and we \u2019re determined to do what we can to get inflation back down.  So that \u2019s really what we \u2019re saying.  We\u2019re not \u2014I\u2019m not \u2014clearly , it\u2019s an incredibly unpopular thing, and it \u2019s very painful for people.  I guess what I \u2019m saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time.  It will take some time , we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  You have talked about inflation a few times and mentioned oil prices, China lockdowns .  But aside from rises in commodity prices such as gas prices, we\u2019 re also seeing stickier measures of inflation increasing , such as the Cleveland Fed \u2019s median and trimmed  mean CPIs.  I mean , how persistent do you see those underlying measures of inflation, and how do you expect to\u2014where do you see those going in the near future \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, as I mentioned , I think , in my opening statement, inflation has started \u2014it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic -related areas , and it \u2019s spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well .  It was really in the  goods  sector at the beginning.  And , particularly , you\u2019re seeing in travel now, if you\u2019 ve flown on a pl ane lately \u2014planes are very full , and plane tickets are very expensive.  S ome of that will be pass-through of  energy prices , but it \u2019s\u2014so you\u2019 re experiencing services inflation.  Shelter inflation is high.  S o the question\u2014 and then you see the Cleveland measure going up, and many other measures are going up.  So it\u2019s a time when we\u2019 re not seeing progress and we want to see    progress , and that \u2019s really another part of why we did what we did today and why the SEP looks like it does .  We see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels, which would be, in the thinking of the Committee, somewhere in the range of 3 to 3\u00bd percent by year -end.  And then after that , you see what the rest of the SEP says.  So I hope that \u2019s responsive t o your question.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer  with Marketplace.  Do you still think a softish landing is possible , and how would you define that at this point considering the revised projections f or unemployment, GDP, inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I think what \u2019s in the SEP would certainly meet that test.  If you see\u2014you\u2019 re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent .  That would be \u2014I would call that as meeting that test.  Do I still think that we can do that?  I do.  I think there \u2019s\u2014I think there \u2019s\u2014I don\u2019 t want to be the handicapper here .  I just\u2014 that is our objective , and I do think it \u2019s possible.  Like I said , though, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created great challenges.  A nd, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it \u2014there \u2019s a much bigger chance now that it \u2019ll depend on factors that we don\u2019 t cont rol, which is , fluctuations and spikes in  commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands.  So we just don\u2019 t know, but we \u2019re focused on \u2014very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which we think is essential for the b enefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chair Powell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more \u2014economists are worried that you \u2019re kind of hitting the economy with a sledgehammer and that now there \u2019s even more risk of a recession than a   50\u201350 path of rates.  So could you talk a little bit more about that ?  And what evidence would get you to stop rate hikes and maybe even reverse them?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure .  So, as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over the last seven months, and that \u2019s a good thing, we think.  But the f ederal f unds r ate, even after this increase , is at 1.6 percent.  So it \u2019s hard to see how that is too high of a rate .  And even if we did another \u2014so we \u2019re going to get here by the end of the summer, somewhere in the 2s probably.  Still, that\u2019 s still a low rate.  So that \u2019s not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession on.  And we \u2019ll\u2014by then,  we\u2019ll have seen a whole lot more data.  As I mentioned a couple times, the Committee \u2019s views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which will be in the 3 to 3\u00bd percent range by the end of this yea r, but that \u2019s conditioned on that being the appropriate thing to do.  If we see data going in a different direction, it \u2019ll be reflected in our policy , as you see today.  We\u2019ll be watching\u2014 if things go in a direction we don\u2019 t expect, then we\u2019 re going to adapt.  And I would say,  this is a highly uncertain environment \u2014extraordinarily uncertain environment.

I was wondering if the F ed has initiated a review of the conduct of monetary policy over the last two years or so, given the inflation, and will that be shared with the public?  And then, secondly, given the illiquidity and the extraordinar y volatility in financial markets, are you concerned that QT will make that worse?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sorry, what was your question on QT?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Just given the illiquidity and extraordinary volatility in financial markets, whether QT will make things wo rse\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, of course , we\u2019ve been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent.  We\u2014it\u2019s hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question mornin g, noon, and night.  But you have to understand the context .  For\u2014really , the context is this :  For decades before the pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let \u2019s call it that, globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity.  So and that \u2019s how all the models work is , decades and decades of data\u2014they look at that .  It\u2019s a very flat Philips curve wor ld, and the supply shocks tend to be transient , right ?  So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks , if you think about it :  the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China \u2014the war in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here.  So we \u2019re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy \u2014we have been , obviously, for quite a while .  But this is a different \u2014these forces  are different.  Inflation is behaving dif ferently , and,  in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand.  B ut you couldn \u2019t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that.  So that \u2019s how we \u2019re looking at it.  And we \u2019ve done a lot of work internally on, and thinking about , what all that means.  You don\u2019 t\u2014the thing is , you don\u2019 t know whether those forces are\u2014to what extent are they going to be sustained ?  In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the    old world, or are we really going to be in a world where major supply shocks go on and on?   The history is , you see these waves of supply shocks, as you did in the \u2019 70s, and then they go away, and sort of there \u2019s a \u201cnew normal ,\u201d and things settle down.  But , honestly, we don\u2019 t know what that\u2019s going to be.  In the meantime , we have to find price stability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where , clearly , inflationary forces are \u2014you \u2019re seeing them everywhere.  Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it \u2019s absolutely extraordi nary.  It\u2019 s not just here.  In fact, we \u2019re sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have , of course , a different kind of inflation than other people have , partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recover ed.  So that \u2019s what we \u2019re doing.  We\u2019ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and\u2014sorry, on QT, we \u2019ve communicated really clearly to the markets about what we\u2019 re going to do there.  Markets seem to be okay with it.  We \u2019re phasing in\u2014Treasury [security] issuance is down quit e a lot, quite a lot from where it\u2019s been, so I have no reason to think\u2014markets are forward looking , and they see this coming.  I have no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems .

I wonder what your assessment is about the outlook for the housing market, given the years -long increase in home prices and now the sharp rise in mortgage rates.  And all that , of course, given the heightened sensitivity around the housing market given the fact that it was a trigger for the great financial crisis over a decade ago.  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: .  Sure.  So rates were very low \u2014a good place to start is that rates were very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could    to support the economy when unemployment was 14 percent and the true unempl oyment rate was well higher than that.  A nd that was a \u2014rates a re low , and now they\u2019 re coming back up to more normal , or above , levels.  So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while  demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wa nting to live in urban areas to some extent to living in single -family homes in the suburbs, famously.  A nd so the demand was just suddenly much higher.  And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years.  So that changes now , and rates have moved up\u2014we \u2019re well aware that mortgage rates have moved up a lot \u2014and you\u2019 re seeing a changing housing market.  We \u2019re watching it to see what will happen.  How much will it really affect residential investment?  Not really sure.  How much will  it affect housing prices?  Not really sure .  It\u2019s\u2014I mean, obviously, we \u2019re watching that quite carefully.  You would think over time \u2014I mean , so there \u2019s a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes , and as those come on  line\u2014whereas the supply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale , is incredibly low, historically low.  So it \u2019s still a very tight market.  So prices may keep going up for a while even in a world where rates ar e up.  S o it\u2019s a complicated situation.  We watch it very carefully.   I would say if you\u2019 re a homebuyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need a bit of a reset.  We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again.  S o this will be a process whereby we \u2014ideally , we do our work in a way that the housing market settles in a new place and housing availability and credit availability are at appropriat e levels.

We offered guidance subject to the economy performing as expected, and if data came in worse, we would consider more aggressive moves. Given recent data, we decided to act now instead of waiting for the next meeting.", "'QUESTION': How did the decision to raise rates by 75 basis points instead of 50 achieve different outcomes and why not go for a full percentage point?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is looking for evidence that inflationary pressures are decreasing and inflation is moving back down. They expected to see signs of inflation flattening out or declining, but inflation surprised to the upside. Strong action was warranted, so they raised rates by 75 basis points to move towards more normal levels. The decision was based on the speed at which they wanted to reach those levels.", "'QUESTION': Do you think a funds rate of 3.8 percent next year will be high enough to bring down inflation?\n'ANSWER': The Committee estimates that a rate of 3.5 to 4 percent is necessary. Factors such as the longer-run neutral rate, broader financial conditions, asset prices, credit spreads, and the yield curve all contribute to this assessment. The goal is to moderate demand and achieve a better balance between supply and demand in the labor market. However, there are external factors, such as commodity price issues and supply-side factors, that can impact inflation.", "'QUESTION': Does a 3.8 percent or 4 percent interest rate effectively combat inflation?\n'ANSWER': It is within the plausible range, but the effectiveness will only be known when we reach that point. Positive real rates and decreasing inflation are expected. The neutral rate is currently low, so it is likely to be effective, but we will rely on empirical evidence and react to incoming data.", "'QUESTION': Was there something unsettling in the inflation expectations data that led to the decision to deviate from previous guidance?\n'ANSWER': Inflation expectations across various measures still indicate that short-term inflation will be high but decrease over the next few years, returning close to 2 percent. However, a few indicators, such as the preliminary Michigan survey and the index of common inflation expectations, raised concerns. These factors, along with the CPI reading, influenced the decision to deviate from previous guidance.", "'QUESTION': If there is another increase in inflation expectations, would the next meeting consider a 75 or 100 basis point increase?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve will react to incoming data appropriately and without specifying a specific number. The main goal is to raise rates, and as the year progresses, they aim to have a restrictive policy in place due to high inflation, although the extent of restrictiveness is uncertain.", "'QUESTION': Do you worry that the late-breaking decision to go to 75 basis points will make policy guidance less effective in the future?\n'ANSWER': We are resolved to be flexible in the implementation of our policy guidance. While providing clarity about our intentions is important, there is always a trade-off because we have to live with that guidance. However, this year has demonstrated how well it can work in tightening financial conditions through the expectations channel. Our guidance is always conditional on what happens, and this late-breaking data is unusual and not expected to happen frequently.", "'QUESTION': On the \"clear and convincing\" threshold for inflation, what level of realized inflation meets that criteria? How is the Committee considering the tradeoff of higher unemployment if inflation doesn't moderate?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell didn't understand the second part of the question.", "QUESTION: What is the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment if inflation is not moderating at an acceptable pace?\n\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve wants to see a decline in monthly inflation readings and for inflation to head down. Once the policy rate is where it should be, the Fed will consider whether to slow down or speed up. They will only declare victory when there is convincing evidence that inflation is coming down, as they have been cautious about declaring victory in the past. The implementation of their policy will be flexible and sensitive to incoming data.", "'QUESTION': Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to require more than just some pain at this point?\n'ANSWER': Our objective is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong. However, external factors like commodity prices and supply chain developments will play a significant role. We can move demand down to address surplus demand in the labor market and product markets, but it won't be easy and depends on factors beyond our control.", "'QUESTION': Is a higher unemployment rate necessary to combat inflation and what is lost if people lose their jobs to control inflation?\n'ANSWER': The projections show unemployment rate ticking up to 4.1 percent, which is still historically low. Achieving inflation down to 2 percent with a 4.1 percent unemployment rate would be considered a successful outcome. The goal is not to have a higher unemployment rate, but rather to achieve a successful outcome.", "'QUESTION': Would that include people losing their jobs?\n'ANSWER': We don't seek to put people out of work. We want a labor market with price stability, where workers receive wage increases and there are ample job opportunities. The pre-pandemic labor market was ideal, with low disparities between groups. However, to achieve this, we need to address the current levels of inflation. Restoring price stability is in service of the labor market we desire.", "'QUESTION': What accounts for the reduced confidence in inflation normalization?\n'ANSWER': The situation has become more difficult due to the consequences of the Ukraine war and global effects of high commodity prices. Headline inflation is important for expectations as people don't distinguish between core and headline inflation, which puts expectations at risk. This is why policy actions were taken to raise rates and reach the desired level in the future.", "QUESTION: Are you hearing from contacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits?\n\nANSWER: We are closely monitoring consumer spending and retail numbers. While there are some decreases in sales, overall spending remains strong. Consumers are in good financial shape and there is no sign of a broader economic slowdown. Consumer confidence may be affected by gas prices and stock prices, but job growth and economic growth are still healthy.", "'QUESTION': So then as you are raising rates in this economy, how closely are you watching consumer spending, or is there something \u00e2\u0080\u0094another indicator that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching more closely?\n'ANSWER': It would be hard to watch anything much more closely than we watch consumer spending, but we watch everything. Consumption is a significant portion of the economy, so we spend a lot of time on that. However, we also closely monitor business fixed investment and other indicators. Overall, the US economy seems well positioned to handle higher interest rates.", "'QUESTION': Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation? How far would you chase oil prices if they keep going up? Would you risk recession for a headline rate if the core rate is holding steady or starting to go down?\n'ANSWER': We are responsible for headline inflation, but we also closely monitor core inflation as it is a better predictor and more relevant to our tools. However, the current situation is difficult because we cannot have much effect on energy and food prices, which are influenced by global commodity prices. We need to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations from headline readings.", "'QUESTION': Could you clarify when the members' forecasts in the SEP were inserted into the record and if they were revised after the CPI or Michigan numbers came out?\n'ANSWER': The SEP reflects all economic readings and includes the 75 basis point increase. Members had this information when they submitted their SEPs, so it is not in addition to what is in the SEP. Each member's SEP reflects their thinking about the rate increase and future actions.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve measure progress and is inflation data a reliable indicator?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve focuses on monitoring demand and its impact on job openings and wages in real time. While wages are not currently driving inflation, they will be important in the future, especially in the service sector. The answer does not directly address whether inflation data is a good indicator or if overshooting is preferred.", "QUESTION: Is inflation data the best indicator for determining the appropriate course of action, or could it lead to overreaction?\n\nANSWER: There is always a risk of going too far or not far enough when using inflation data as a guide. It is a difficult judgment to make, but we are aware of the dangers. Failing to restore price stability is not an option, as it is crucial for the economy to function properly. We believe that the recent inflation is not impacting expectations significantly, and the public has confidence in our ability to bring inflation down to 2 percent. Sustaining that confidence is key.", "'QUESTION': Does the general feel among American households and businesses square with your explanation of the economy, given that the description of inflation in the statement didn't change between May and June?\n\n'ANSWER': People are experiencing high inflation for the first time in 40 years, and it is causing hardship. The Federal Reserve understands this and is determined to use its tools to bring inflation back down over time, although it will take some time to do so.", "'QUESTION': How persistent do you see the underlying measures of inflation, such as the Cleveland Fed's median and trimmed mean CPIs, and where do you see them going in the near future?\n'ANSWER': Inflation has spread broadly across the economy and into the services sector. Travel expenses, energy prices, and shelter inflation are contributing to the increase in inflation measures. The goal is to see progress in inflation, which is why the policy rate is expected to reach restrictive levels of 3 to 3\u00c2\u00bd percent by year-end.", "'QUESTION': Do you still think a softish landing is possible, and how would you define that at this point considering the revised projections for unemployment, GDP, inflation?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell believes that the revised projections in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) would meet the criteria for a soft landing, with inflation reaching almost 2 percent by 2024 and the unemployment rate remaining low at 4.1 percent. However, recent events have increased the challenges, and the outcome will depend on factors beyond their control, such as commodity price fluctuations. The focus remains on bringing inflation down to 2 percent and restoring a strong labor market.", "QUESTION: Could you talk more about the concerns that rate hikes may lead to a recession and what evidence would make you stop or reverse them?\n\nANSWER: Financial conditions have tightened, but the current federal funds rate is still low at 1.6%. Even if rates increase to the 2s by the end of summer, it is not calculated to cause a recession. The Committee's stance is modestly restrictive, but they will adapt if data goes in an unexpected direction. The environment is highly uncertain.", "'QUESTION': Has the Fed initiated a review of monetary policy conduct over the last two years and will it be shared with the public? Are there concerns that QT will worsen illiquidity and volatility in financial markets?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell asks for clarification on the question regarding QT.", "'QUESTION': Will QT make things worse given the illiquidity and volatility in financial markets?\n'ANSWER': We have been closely examining the reasons for the unexpected and persistent increase in inflation. The context is that inflation was previously influenced by disinflationary forces, but now we are experiencing different forces such as supply shocks. We are uncertain about the sustainability of these forces and their impact on the economy. However, we have communicated our plans for QT clearly to the markets and they seem to understand and accept it, so we do not anticipate it causing illiquidity or problems.", "'QUESTION': What is the assessment of the outlook for the housing market given the increase in home prices and rise in mortgage rates?\n'ANSWER': Rates were low due to the pandemic, causing high demand for housing and price increases. Now that rates are rising, the housing market is changing, but the impact on residential investment and housing prices is uncertain. There is a surplus of unfinished homes and low inventory of finished homes, so prices may continue to rise. The goal is to achieve a balance in supply, demand, inflation, and mortgage rates."]}
