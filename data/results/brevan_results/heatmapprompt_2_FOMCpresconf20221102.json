Colby Smith with the Financial Times.   On the need to slow the pace of rate increases at some point :  Is a downshift contingent on a string of better  inflation data specifically between now and , let\u2019s say , the December meeting?  Or is that something that the F ed could potentially proceed with, independent of that data, given the lagged  effects  that you mentioned?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So a couple things on that .  We do need to see inflation coming down decisively , and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings.  Of course , that\u2019s what we \u2019d all love to see, but that \u2019s\u2014I\u2019ve never thought of that as the appropriate test for slowing the pac e of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we \u2019re aiming for.  We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that \u2019s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.  How w ill we know that we\u2019ve reached that level?  Well, we\u2019 ll take into account the full range of analysis and data that bear on that question, guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened, the effects that that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation,    taking into consideration lags, as I mentioned.  We will be looking at real rates, for example, all across the yield curve and all other financial conditions as we make that assessment.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters.  I \u2019m sure there\u2019 s going to be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you\u2019 re going to slow in December or not.  Would you say that the bias right now is not for another 75 basis poi nt increase?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of our broader tightening program , if I may , and talk about the statement language along the way.  So I think you can think about our tightening program as really addressing three questions , the first of which was , and has been, how fast to go.   The second is how high to raise our policy rate .  And the  third will be, eventually, how long to remain at a restrictive level . So on the first question \u2014how fast to tighten policy\u2014it \u2019s been very important that we move expeditiously, and we have clearly done so .  We\u2019ve moved 3\u00be percent since March, admittedly from a base of zero.  It\u2019s a historically fast pace , and that \u2019s certainly appropriate given the persistence and streng th in inflation and the low level from which we started.  So now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate .  And we\u2019re saying that we\u2019 d raise that rate to a level that \u2019s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our 2 percent target over time , and we put that into our postmeeting statement because that really does become the important question,  we think now, is how far to go.  A nd I\u2019ll talk more about that.  We think there \u2019s some ground to cover before we meet that test , and that \u2019s why we say that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate .  And, as I mentioned, incoming data between the meetings, both a strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report, do suggest to me that    we may ultimately move to higher  levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting.  That level is very uncertain , though, and I would say we \u2019re going to find it over time.  Of course , with the lags between policy and economic activity, there \u2019s a lot of uncertainty, so we note t hat in determining the pace of future increases, we \u2019ll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation.  So I would say, as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed become s less important than the second and third questions .  And that \u2019s why I \u2019ve said at the last two press conferences that at some point , it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases.  So that time is coming , and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that.  No decision has been made.  It is likely we \u2019ll have a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion.  To be clear , let me say again  [that] the question  of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which really will be our princip al focus.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, core PCE inflation on a 3-  or 6- month annualized basis and on a 12- month basis has been running in the high 4s, close to 5 percent.  Is there any reason to think you won\u2019 t have to raise rates at least above that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So this is the question of , does the policy rate need to get above the inflation rate?  And I would say, there are a range of view s on it .  That \u2019s the classic \u201cTaylor principle \u201d view.  But I would think you\u2019 d look more at a forward, a forward -looking measure of inflation to look at that.  But I think the answer is , we\u2019ll want to get the policy rate to a level where it is, where the real interest rate is positive.  We will want to do that.  I do not think of it as the single and only touchstone , though.  I think you put some weight on that ; you also put some weight on rates across the curve.  Very few people borrow at the short end \u2014at the federal funds rate, for example .  So households and businesses, if they\u2019 re [borrowing] \u2014[there are] very meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them, credit spreads are larger, so borrowing rates are significantly higher , and I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit.  So  I would look at that as an important feature.  I \u2019d put some weight on it , but I wouldn\u2019 t say it \u2019s something that is the single , dominant thing to look at.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could follow  up:  W hat is your best assessment , or the staff \u2019s best assessment right now , of the current rate of underlying inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I don\u2019 t have a specific number for you there.  There are many, many models that look at that .  And, I mean , one way to look at it is  that it \u2019s a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs \u2014above that level , for sure \u2014substantially above for some time, you\u2019ll see it move up , but the movement will be fairly gradual.  So I think that \u2019s what the princip al models would tend to say.  But I wouldn\u2019 t want to land on any one assessment.  There are many different \u2014as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying inflation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  T hank you for taking our questions.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.   I wondered, do you see any evidence at this stage that inflation is , or is at risk of becoming , entrenched\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Is inflation becoming entrenched?  So I guess I would start by pointing to expectations .  So if we saw longer -term expectations moving up, that would be very troubling.  And they were moving up a little bit at the middle part of this year, and they \u2019ve moved now back down.  T hat\u2019s one piece of data.  Shorter -term inflation expectations moved up between the last meeting and this meeting, and we don\u2019 t think those are as indicative , but they may be important in the wage -setting process.  There \u2019s a school of thought that believes that.  So that\u2019s very concerning.  I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have \u2014we \u2019re now 18 months into this episode of high inflation , and we don\u2019 t have a clearly identified , scientific way of    understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched.  And so the thing we need to do from a risk -management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully and get inflation under control \u2014get it down to 2 percent \u2014get it behind us.  That \u2019s what we really need to do and what we \u2019re strongly committed to doing\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  Rachel Siegel from t he Washington Post.  The statement points to lag times .  I\u2019m wondering if you can walk us through how you judge those lag e ffects, what that timeline looks like over the coming months or even a year , and where you would expect it to show up in different parts of the economy.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So the way I would think about that is , it\u2019s commonly, for a long time, thought that monetary policy works with \u201c long and variable lags ,\u201d and that it works first on financial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on inflation.  So that \u2019s been the thinking for a long time.  There was an old literature that made those lags out to be fairly long.  There \u2019s newer literature that says that they \u2019re shorter.   The truth is, we don\u2019 t have a lot of data [consisting] of inflation of [rates] this high i n what is , now , the modern economy.  One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the f ederal funds r ate, financial conditions would react , and then that would affect economic activity and inflation.  Now financial conditions react wel l before in  expectation of monetary policy  [actions] .  That\u2019s the way it has moved for a quarter of a century \u2014in the direction of financial conditions , then monetary policy\u2014because the markets are thinking , what  is the c entral bank going to do?  And there are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change, that the effects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before.   We don \u2019t know    that.  I guess the thing that I would say is :  It\u2019s highly uncertain\u2014highly uncertain.  A nd so from a risk -management  standpoint \u2014but we do need, it would be irresponsible not to, to ignore them .  But you want to consider them but not take them literally.  So I think it \u2019s a very difficult place to be, but I would t end to be \u2014want to be in the middle looking carefully at what \u2019s actually happening with the economy a nd trying to make good decisions from a risk- management standpoint, remembering , of course , that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy, whereas if we don\u2019 t get inflation under control because we don\u2019t tighten enough, now we \u2019re in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the costs, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially .  So from a risk -management standpoint, we want to be sure that we don\u2019 t make the mistake of either failing to tighten enough or loosening policy too soon\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And if I could follow  up:  S hould we interpret the addition to the statement to mean that more weight is put into those lag e ffects than they would have been after previous rate hikes?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these ongoing rate hikes and policy becomes more restrictive, it \u2019ll be appropriate now to be thinking more about lags .  Of course, we think about lag s\u2014the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy .  But we will be thinking about them , but we won\u2019 t be\u2014I think we \u2019ll be considering them but because it \u2019s appropriate to do so.  Let me say this :  It is very premature to be thinking about pausing.  So people, when they hear lags, they think about a pause.  It\u2019s very premature , in my view , to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hike.  We have a ways to go.  O ur policy\u2014we need ongoing rate hikes to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive.  And we don \u2019t\u2014of course , we don\u2019 t really know exactly where that is.  We have a sense, and    we\u2019ll write down in September\u2014sorry, in the December meeting , a new S ummary of Economic Projections , which updates that.  But I would expect us  to continue to update  it based on what we\u2019re seeing with incoming data.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Housing\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Oh , housing\u2014the housing part of it.  Ye s, so we look at housing \u2014of course, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the Global F inancial C risis\u2014they \u2019re not historically high, but the y\u2019re much higher    than they \u2019ve been.  A nd you\u2019 re seeing housing activity decline, and you\u2019 re seeing housing prices growing at a faster rate and , in some parts of the country, declining.  You know, I would say housing was \u2014the housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic as demand increased and rates were low.   We all know the stories of how overheated the housing market was, prices going up.  Many, many bidders and no conditions, that kind of thing.  So the housing mar ket needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand.  We\u2019re well  aware of what \u2019s going on there.  From a financial stability standpoint, we didn \u2019t see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the G lobal F inancial Cr isis.  Housing credit was very carefully \u2014much more carefully managed by the lenders .  So it\u2019s a very different situation and doesn\u2019 t present potential financial\u2014doesn \u2019t appear to present financial stability issues.  But , no, we do understand that that \u2019s really where a very big effect of our policy is\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Victoria Guid a with Politico.  I wanted to ask about the labor market.  You mentioned early on, again, that job openings are very high compared to available workers, and I \u2019m just curious to what extent you do and don\u2019 t draw signal from that.  So, for example, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to tick up, will that make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings?  What do you see \u2014are wages what \u2019s really important?  How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we talk a lot about vacancies in the\u2014 vacancy -to-unemployed rate, but it\u2019 s just one, it \u2019s just another data series.  It\u2019s been unusually important in this cycle because it \u2019s been so out of line.  But so has quits.  So have wages.  So we look at a very wide range of data on the unemployment \u2014on the labor m arket.  So I\u2019d start with unemployment ,    which is typically the single statistic you would look to, is at a 50 -year low, 3\u00bd percent .  We\u2019re getting really nothing in labor supply now.  We had , I think , very small increase this year , which we had really thought, we thought we would get that back.  Most analysts thought we would get some labor supply coming in. You mentioned wages, so I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture.  It\u2019s true , with average hourly earnings , you see \u2014so I would call  it a flattening out at a level that\u2019s well  above the level that would be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation, assuming a reasonable productivity.  With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture.  The headline number was a disappointment .  Let\u2019s just say it was high.  It didn \u2019t show a decline.  There \u2019s some rays  of light inside that if you look at private -sector workers \u2014that did come down, that compensation did come down.  Overall , though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor market where demand substantially exceeds supply.  Job creation still exceeds sort of the level that would hold the market where it is.  So that \u2019s the picture.  Do we see\u2014we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is happening.  And maybe that \u2019s there, but it \u2019s not obvious to me , because wages aren \u2019t coming down\u2014they\u2019 re just moving sideways at an elevated level, both E CI and average hourly earnings.  We want to see\u2014we wou ld love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down.  They are coming down.  V acancies are below their all -time high but not by as much as we thought , because\u2014and the data series is volatile, we never take any one reading, we always look at two or three.  So it \u2019s a mixed picture.  I don \u2019t see the case for real softening just yet.  But we look at, I guess as I just showed you, we look at a very broad range of data on the labor market.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: I think wages have an effect on inflation and inflation has an effect on wages.  I think that\u2019 s always been the case.  There \u2019s always\u2014going back and forth, the question is , is that really elevated right now?  I don \u2019t think so.  I  don\u2019 t think wages are the princi pal story of why prices are going up.  I don\u2019 t think that.  I also don \u2019t think that we see a wage \u2013price spiral, but , again, it \u2019s not something you can\u2014once you see it, you\u2019 re in trouble.  So we don\u2019 t want to see it.  We wan t wages to go up \u2014we just want them to go up at a level that \u2019s sustainable and consistent with 2 percent inflation.  And we think we can \u2014we do think that , given the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as history would indicate through the unemployment channel.  It can soften through job openings declining .  We think there \u2019s room for that.  But we won \u2019t know that \u2014that \u2019ll be, that \u2019ll be discovered empirically.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you so much.  Kayla Tausche f rom CNBC.  Earlier last month, the United Nations warned that there could be a global recession if central banks didn \u2019t change course.  The new U .K. prime minister warned of a profound economic crisis there.  And I\u2019m wondering how the F ed is weighing inter national developments in light of a very strong economy here in the U.S. that would seem to be bucking those trends.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , of course , we, we keep close tabs on economic developments and also geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad.  We\u2019re in very frequent contact with our foreign counterparts both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central b anks that we have, and I have one this weekend with many, many central bankers.  So we \u2019re in touch with all of that.  So I guess what \u2014it\u2019s clearly a time, a difficult time in the global economy.  W e\u2019re seeing very high inflation in Europe, significantly be cause of high energy prices related to the war in Ukraine.  And we \u2019re seeing China \u2019s having issues with the    zero-COVID policy and much slower growth than we \u2019re used to seeing.  So we \u2019re seeing \u2014we see those difficulties.  T he strong dollar is a challenge fo r some countries.  But we haven\u2019 t\u2014we take all of that into account in our models .  We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing.  Here in the United States , we have a strong economy, and we have an economy where inflation is running at 5 percent .  Core PCE inflation \u2014which is a really good indicator of what \u2019s going on for us , the way we see it \u2014is running at 5.1 percent on a 12- month basis and sort of similar to that on a 3- , 6-, and 9- month basis.  So we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation under control.  The world\u2019 s not going to be better off if we fail to do that.  That \u2019s a task we need to do.  Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a long period of time.  Price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy\u2014for decades, hopefully\u2014even though it may be difficult to get it back.  G etting it back is something that gives \u2014that provides value to the people we serve for the long run.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could just follow  up up on that \u2014thank you.  The F ed has acknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don\u2019 t affect things like energy and food prices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas, and they\u2019 re some of the biggest pain points for consumers.  So as you pursue the current path that you\u2019 ve outlined, is there a risk that some of those prices simply don\u2019 t come down?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we don\u2019 t directly affect , for the most part, food and energy prices, but the demand channel  does affect them just at the marg in.  The thing about the United States is that we also have strong \u2014in many other jurisdictions , the principal  problem really is energy.  In the United States , we also have a demand issue.  We\u2019 ve got an imbalance between demand and supply, which you see in many parts of the economy.  So our tools are well  suited to work on that problem, and that \u2019s what we \u2019re doing.  You \u2019re right, though.  W e don\u2019 t\u2014the price of oil is    set globally , and it \u2019s not something we can affect.  I think by the actions that we take , though, we help keep longer -term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2 percent inflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.  So the F ed is facing two more ethics -related incidents with the revision of the financial statements from President Bostic and President Bullard speaking at a closed event.

And we \u2019ve taken a number of steps , and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are.  I would say that our new investment program that we have is up now and running, and, actually , it was through that that the problems with President Bostic \u2019s disclosures were discovered , when he filed his new disclosure .  We now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into disclosures and follows them and approves people \u2019s disclosures and also all of their trades.  Any    trade anyone has to make is covered , has to be  approved, preapproved, and there \u2019s a lag \u2014it has to be preapproved 45 days before it happens , so there \u2019s no ability to game market s.  So it\u2019s a really good system .  It worked here.  And we \u2014I think we all said to each other today \u2014yesterday , actually, yester day morning, we recommitted to each other and to this institution to hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Do you have an update on the investigations that are pending?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I don\u2019 t.  So, as you know, I referred the matter concerning President Bostic to the inspector general , and once that happens, I don\u2019 t discuss it with the i nspector general or with anybody.   It\u2019s just \u2014the inspector general has, he has the ability to do investigations .  We don\u2019 t really have that.  So that \u2019s what he \u2019s doing\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  Earlier this year , you touted the three -month bi ll yield out to 18 months as the yield curve with 100 percent expl anatory power.  And you said, quote , \u201cIf it\u2019s inverted, that means the F ed\u2019s going to cut, which means the economy is weak.\u201d   That curve is only 2 basis points away from inversion now, so I \u2019m wondering why you are so confident that you have not overtightened , particularly given that rates work with a lag.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, so we do monitor the near -term forward spread \u2014you\u2019 re right.  And it \u2019s\u2014that \u2019s been our preferred measure.  We think, just empirically , it dominates the ones that people tend to look at, which is 2s, 10s, and things like that.  So it \u2019s not inverted.   And, also , you have to look at why things \u2014why the rate curve is doing what it \u2019s doing.  It can be doing that because it affects\u2014 it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down.  In this case, if you\u2019re in a situation where the markets are pricing in  significant declines in inflation, that \u2019s    going to affect the forward curve .  So, yes, we monitor it.  Y ou\u2019re right.  And that\u2019s what I would say.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could follow  up:  Y ou also said several meetings ago that the risk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much.  Is what you\u2019 re trying to tell us today is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well , what \u2019s happened is , time has passed , and we \u2019ve raised interest rates by 375 basis points.  I would not \u2014I would not change a word in that statement , though.  I think until we get inflation down, you\u2019 ll be hearing that from me.  Again, if we overtighten\u2014and we don\u2019 t want to, we want to get this exactly right \u2014but if we overtighten, then we have the ability with our tools, which are powerful, to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic episode, we can support economic acti vity strongly if that happens, if that \u2019s necessary.  On the other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it \u2019s a year or two down the road, and you\u2019 re realizing , inflation behaving the way it can, you \u2019re realizing you didn\u2019 t actually get it, you have to go back in.  By then, the risk , really , is that it has become entrenched in people \u2019s thinking.  A nd the record is that the employment costs \u2014the cost to the people that we don\u2019 t want to hurt\u2014they go up with the passage of time.  That \u2019s really how I look at it.  So that isn \u2019t going to change.  What has changed , though\u2014you\u2019 re right \u2014is, we\u2019re farther along now.  And I think as we \u2019re farther along, we \u2019re now focused on t hat.  What\u2019s the place, what \u2019s the level we need to get to rates?   And I don\u2019 t know what we \u2019ll do when we get there, by the way.  I t doesn\u2019 t\u2014we \u2019ll have to see.  There \u2019s been no decision or discussion around exactly what steps we would take at that point.  But the first thing is to find your way there.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  Just to go back to housing for a minute :  You mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on housing\u2014h ome sales are down 25 percent in the past year , and so forth \u2014but none of this is really showing up in, as you know, in the government \u2019s inflation measures.  And as we  go forward, private real -time data is clearly showing these hits to housing.  Are you going to need to put a greater weight on that in order to ascertain things like whether there \u2019s overtightening going on, or will you still focus as much on the more lagg ing government indicators?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So this is an interesting subject.  So I start by saying, I guess , that the measure that \u2019s in the  CPI and the PCE, it captures rents for all tenants, not just new leases.  And that makes sense, actually , because fo r that reason \u2014conceptually , that is \u2014that \u2019s sort of the right target for monetary policy.  And the same thing is true for owners \u2019 equivalent rent , which comes off of \u2014it\u2019s a reweighting of tenant rents.  The private measures are, of course , good at picking up, at the margin, the new leases, and they tell you a couple things .  One thing is, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of that series of the new leases, it \u2019s very pro- cyclical, so rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did.  And now they\u2019 re coming down faster.  B ut what you\u2019 re\u2014the implication is that there are still , as people, as non -new leases roll  over and expire, right , they \u2019re still in the pipeline, there \u2019s still some significant rate increases coming , okay?  But at some point, once you get through that, the new leases are going to tell you \u2014what they \u2019re telling you is , there will come a point at which rent inflation will start to come down.  B ut that point is well out from where we are now.  So we \u2019re well  aware of that , of course , and we look at it.  B ut I would say that in terms of\u2014the right way to think about inflation , really , is to look at the measure that we do look at, but considering tha t we also know that at some point , you\u2019 ll see rents coming down.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Great, and just a quick follow.  It looks like stock and bond markets are reacting positively to your announcement so far.  Is that something you wanted to see?  Is that  a problem or what \u2014how that might affect your future policy to see this positive reaction?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: We\u2019 re not targeting any one or two particular things.  Our message should be \u2014what I \u2019m trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think we have a ways to go, we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive.  And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step.  And that \u2019s meant to put that question, really , as the important one now , going forward.  I\u2019ve also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in Septe mber \u2014the incoming data suggests that that \u2019s actually going to be higher , and that \u2019s been the pattern.  I mean , I would have little confidence that the forecast\u2014 if we made a forecast today, if we were doing an SEP today, the pattern has been that , one after  another , they go up , and that \u2019ll end when it ends, but there \u2019s no sense that inflation is coming down.  I f you look at the \u2014I have a table of the last 12 months of 12- month readings , and there \u2019s really no pattern there.  We \u2019re exactly where we were a year ago.  S o I would also say, it \u2019s premature to discuss pausing.  And it \u2019s not something that we \u2019re thinking about .  That\u2019s really not a conversation to be had now.  We have a ways to go. And the last thing I \u2019ll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done and to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon.  So those \u2014I control those messages, and that\u2019s my job.  \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Edward Lawrence with F ox Business.  T hank you, Fed Chairman.  So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve \u2019s trying to do to get inflation back to the 2 percent target?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: In theory, it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader context is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep spending even in\u2014so I think those two things do tend to wage \u2014to sort of counterbalance each other out.  It appears, consumer spending is still positive \u2014it\u2019s at pretty m odest growth levels .  It\u2019s not shrinking.  T he banks that deal with retail customers and many retailers will tell you that the consumers are still buying and they \u2019re still\u2014 they\u2019re fine .  So I don\u2019 t know how big the fiscal headwinds are , and they haven\u2019 t shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining spending.  So it must have to do with the savings that people have\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: So, what about the spending?  There \u2019s tens of billions yet to be spent , I mean , from the Inflation Reduction Act, the American Rescue Plan, CHIPS Act, bipartisan infrastructure bill.  H ow does that play  into your thinking about the future?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Demand is going to have some support from those savings and also from the strong demand that \u2019s still in the labor market.  We still see pretty significant demand and a tightening labor market in some respects, although I think, overall , I would say it \u2019s not really t ightening or loosening.  So we see those things , and what those things tell us is that our job is going to require some resolve and some patience over time.  We \u2019re going to have to stick with this.  And that \u2019s just \u2014we take all that as a given , but we know what our objective is , and we know what our tools can do, and that \u2019s how we think about it.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.  I \u2019m wondering, has the window for a soft landing narrowed?  Do you still think it\u2019s possible\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Has it narrowed?   Yes.  Is it still possible?  Yes.  W e\u2019ve always said it was going to be difficult, but I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer , it becomes harder to see the path \u2014it\u2019s narrowed.  I would say the path has narrowed over the course of the last year, really.  Hard to say.  Hard to say.  Again, I would say that the sort of array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and, to many economists, there is a path to\u2014ordinarily there \u2019s a relationship to GDP going down and vacancies declining, translating into unemployment , or there \u2019s Okun\u2019 s law.  So all those things are relationships that are in the data, and t hey\u2019re very real.  Data \u2019s a little bit different this time , though, because you have this tremendously high level of vacancies and, we think, on a very steep part of the Beveridge  curve.  All I would say is that the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated by those traditional measures , because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so strong.  Again, that \u2019s going to be something we discover empirically.  I think no one knows whether there\u2019 s going to be a recession or  not and,  if so, how bad that recession would be.  And our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time.  And that \u2019s what we\u2019 re going to do\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Just real quickly\u2014why do you fee l like the window has narrowed?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: .   Because we haven \u2019t seen inflation coming down.  The implication of inflation not coming down.  W hat we would expect by now to have seen is that as the \u2014really , as the supply -side problems have resolved themselv es, we would have expected goods inflation to    come down by now, long since by now.  And it really hasn \u2019t.  Actually , it has come down , but not to the extent that we had hoped.  At the same time, now you see services inflation, core services inflation moving up, and I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year, without question.  That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive , and that narrows the path to a soft landing , I would say.

Price stability is crucial for the economy to work for everyone and without it, sustained strong labor market conditions cannot be achieved. Today, the FOMC raised their policy interest rate by 75 basis points and they anticipate ongoing increases to be appropriate. They are purposefully moving their policy stance to a sufficiently restrictive level to return inflation to 2 percent and are also reducing the size of their balance sheet.Restoring price stability will require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The US economy has slowed significantly, with growth in consumer spending and the housing sector weakening, but the labor market remains tight with low unemployment and elevated wage growth.Job gains have been strong, but the labor market remains imbalanced with demand exceeding available workers. Inflation remains well above the goal, with price pressures evident across various sectors, and the longer high inflation persists, the higher the risk of entrenched expectations.The Federal Reserve is committed to promoting maximum employment and stable prices, and is aware of the hardship caused by high inflation. They have raised interest rates and are reducing the size of their balance sheet to address these concerns, but acknowledge that it will take time for the full effects to be realized. They will consider the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and its impact on economic activity and inflation when determining future rate increases.The Federal Reserve plans to slow the pace of interest rate increases as inflation approaches the 2 percent goal, but there is uncertainty around the appropriate level of interest rates. The decisions will be based on incoming data and their implications for the economy, and the Fed will continue to communicate its thinking clearly.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to continuing their efforts until their objectives are met, acknowledging the impact of their actions on various stakeholders. They are dedicated to fulfilling their public mission by striving to achieve maximum employment and price stability, and are open to addressing any inquiries.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Is a downshift in the pace of rate increases contingent on better inflation data or can the Fed proceed independently?\n'ANSWER': The Fed needs to see inflation coming down decisively, but a series of down monthly readings is not the only test for slowing the pace of increases. The Fed will consider a range of analysis and data, including the tightening of financial conditions and its effects on the real economy and inflation, taking into account lags. Real rates and other financial conditions will also be assessed.", "'QUESTION': Is the bias right now not for another 75 basis point increase?\n'ANSWER': The focus is not on the speed of tightening policy, but rather on how high to raise the policy rate and how long to keep monetary policy restricted. The pace of future increases will be determined by considering the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which it affects economic activity and inflation. The decision to slow the pace of increases may come as soon as the next meeting.", "'QUESTION': Is there any reason to think you won't have to raise rates above the high 4s or close to 5 percent to bring inflation down?\n'ANSWER': There are different views on whether the policy rate needs to be above the inflation rate. We should consider forward-looking measures of inflation. The goal is to have a positive real interest rate. However, we should also consider rates across the curve and the impact on borrowing rates and financial conditions. It's an important factor, but not the only one to consider.", "'QUESTION': What is the current rate of underlying inflation according to the staff's assessment?\n'ANSWER': The Chair does not have a specific number, but there are various models that analyze this. Generally, when inflation exceeds a certain level for a significant period, it will gradually increase. However, the Chair does not want to rely on any single assessment as multiple sources publish their own evaluations of underlying inflation.", "'QUESTION': Do you see any evidence at this stage that inflation is, or is at risk of becoming, entrenched?\n'ANSWER': Inflation becoming entrenched would be concerning, but longer-term expectations have moved back down. Shorter-term inflation expectations have increased, which may be important in wage-setting. We don't have a clear understanding of when inflation becomes entrenched, so we need to use our tools to get inflation under control and reach our target of 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve judge the lag effects of monetary policy and what is the timeline for these effects in the economy?\n'ANSWER': Monetary policy is believed to have long and variable lags, first affecting financial conditions, then economic activity, and eventually inflation. However, there is uncertainty due to limited data on high inflation rates in the modern economy. Financial conditions now react before monetary policy actions, and there is debate on whether the effects on the economy are faster. The Federal Reserve aims to carefully assess the economy and make risk-management decisions to avoid overtightening or loosening policy too soon.", "'QUESTION': Should we interpret the addition to the statement to mean that more weight is put into those lag effects than they would have been after previous rate hikes?\n'ANSWER': As policy becomes more restrictive, it is appropriate to consider the lag effects more. However, it is premature to think about pausing rate hikes. Ongoing rate hikes are needed to reach the desired level of restriction, and the exact level is uncertain. The Summary of Economic Projections will be updated based on incoming data.", "'QUESTION': What is the current state of the housing market and its relationship to higher interest rates?\n'ANSWER': Housing activity has declined and prices are growing at a faster rate, with some parts of the country experiencing declines. The housing market was overheated after the pandemic due to increased demand and low rates. However, there is a need for a balance between supply and demand. Unlike before the Global Financial Crisis, housing credit has been carefully managed, reducing potential financial stability issues.", "'QUESTION': To what extent does the Federal Reserve draw signal from the high number of job openings compared to available workers? Will a slowdown in wage growth or an increase in the unemployment rate decrease the focus on job openings? How does the Fed view the labor market in relation to inflation?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve considers job openings, along with quits and wages, as important indicators of the labor market. While unemployment is at a 50-year low, there has been minimal growth in labor supply. Wage growth is mixed, with average hourly earnings flattening out at a level above 2 percent inflation. The overall picture is of an overheated labor market with high demand and limited supply. The Fed is looking for signs of a gradual softening but has not seen significant evidence yet.", "'QUESTION': Do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation?\n'ANSWER': Wages have an effect on inflation and vice versa, but currently, wages are not the main reason for rising prices. We don't see a wage-price spiral, but we want wages to increase sustainably in line with 2 percent inflation. The labor market can soften without relying solely on unemployment, and we believe there is room for job openings to decline. However, this will be determined empirically.", "'QUESTION': How is the Fed weighing international developments in light of a strong US economy?\n'ANSWER': The Fed closely monitors economic and geopolitical developments abroad, maintaining frequent contact with foreign counterparts. They acknowledge the challenges in the global economy, such as high inflation in Europe, China's slower growth, and the impact of the strong dollar on other countries. The Fed takes all of these factors into account in their models and recognizes the importance of using their tools to control inflation for the benefit of the global economy.", "'QUESTION': Is there a risk that food and energy prices won't come down as the Fed pursues its current path?\n'ANSWER': The Fed doesn't directly affect food and energy prices, but the demand channel does have an impact. In the United States, there is an imbalance between demand and supply, which our tools are suited to address. While we can't control the global price of oil, our actions help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and maintain public belief in 2 percent inflation.", "'QUESTION': What does the recent ethics-related incidents at the Fed do to the public's trust in the bank and what is the Fed doing to prevent such behavior?\n'ANSWER': The Fed acknowledges that the public's trust is crucial and any violation of rules risks undermining that trust. They have taken steps to address the issue, including implementing a new investment program, establishing a central group to monitor disclosures and trades, and preapproving all trades to prevent market manipulation. The Fed is committed to holding themselves to the highest standards and avoiding future problems.", "'QUESTION': Do you have an update on the investigations that are pending?\n'ANSWER': I don't. I referred the matter to the inspector general and once that happens, I don't discuss it with them or anyone else. The inspector general is responsible for conducting investigations, which is not within our authority.", "'QUESTION': Why are you confident that you have not overtightened, given that the yield curve is close to inversion?\n'ANSWER': We monitor the near-term forward spread, which we believe is a better measure than the 2s, 10s curve. The curve may be close to inversion due to expectations of rate cuts or declining inflation. We take this into consideration and continue to monitor it.", "QUESTION: Is the risk assessment of doing too little versus doing too much changed?\nANSWER: The risk assessment has not changed. The Federal Reserve will continue to prioritize getting inflation down and avoiding overtightening. They have the ability to support economic activity if necessary, but if they let inflation drag on, it could become entrenched and lead to higher employment costs. The focus now is on determining the level of interest rates needed, with no decision made on the steps to take once that level is reached.", "QUESTION: Are you going to need to put a greater weight on private real-time data on housing to determine if there is overtightening, or will you still focus on government indicators?\n\nANSWER: The government's inflation measures capture rents for all tenants, not just new leases, which is the right target for monetary policy. Private measures are good at picking up new leases, showing that rents have gone up more than the government measures. However, at some point, rent inflation will start to come down.", "'QUESTION': Is the positive reaction in stock and bond markets to the FOMC announcement something you wanted to see and how will it affect future policy?\n'ANSWER': We are not targeting specific market reactions. Our goal is to make it clear that we have more to do with interest rates before reaching a sufficiently restrictive level. The focus should be on this goal and not on discussions of pausing or withdrawing policy too soon.", "'QUESTION': How much of a hindrance is fiscal spending to the Federal Reserve's efforts to achieve a 2 percent inflation target?\n'ANSWER': While fiscal spending was initially seen as a hindrance, the significant amount of savings held by households has allowed for continued consumer spending, counterbalancing the impact. Consumer spending remains positive and at modest growth levels, with no significant signs of fiscal headwinds restraining spending.", "'QUESTION': How does the remaining spending from various acts and bills impact the future?\n'ANSWER': The savings from the remaining spending and the strong demand in the labor market will provide support for demand. The labor market is tightening in some respects, but overall it is not tightening or loosening. Our job will require resolve and patience, and we will stick with it based on our objectives and the capabilities of our tools.", "'QUESTION': Has the window for a soft landing narrowed? Do you still think it's possible?\n'ANSWER': Yes, the window has narrowed but it is still possible. The difficulty lies in the need for higher and sustained interest rates, making it harder to see the path. The labor market data is unusual, with high vacancies and a strong labor market, which may result in fewer job losses than expected. The possibility of a recession and its severity is uncertain, but the goal is to restore price stability and a strong labor market.", "'QUESTION': Why do you feel like the window has narrowed?\n'ANSWER': The window has narrowed because inflation has not come down as expected. Goods inflation has not decreased to the extent hoped for, while services inflation is increasing. This makes the inflation picture more challenging, requiring more restrictive policy and narrowing the path to a soft landing."]}
