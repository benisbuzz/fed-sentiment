There is every reason to expect, Madam Chair, that the PCE inflation rate, which is followed by the Fed, looks likely to exceed your 2016 consensus forecast next week .  Does this suggest that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve on inflation?  And what tolerance is there for higher inflation at the Federal Reserve?  And if it\u2019 s above the 2 percent target, then how is that not kind of blowing through a target the same way    you blew through the 6\u00bd percent unemployment target in that they become these soft targets?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, thanks for the question.  So I think recent readings on, for example, the CPI index have been a bit on the high side, but I think it\u2019 s\u2014the data that we \u2019re seeing is noisy.  I think it\u2019 s important to remember that, broadly speaking, inflation is evolving in line with the C ommittee \u2019s expectati ons.  The C ommittee, it h as expected a gradual return in inflation toward its 2 percent objective.  And I think the recent evidence we have seen, abstracting from the noise, suggests that we are moving back gradually over time toward our 2 percent objectiv e, and I see things roughly in line with where we expected inflation to be.  I think if you look at the SEP projections that were submitted this time, you see very little change in inflation projections of the C ommittee .\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: What about the tolerance for higher inflation?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, the C ommittee has emphasized that we have  the 2  percent objective  for, as a longer -term matter , for PCE inflation and we would not willingly see a prolonged period in which inflation persistently runs below our objective or above our objective , and that remains true.  So that hasn \u2019t changed at all in terms of the C ommittee \u2019s tolerance for permanent deviations from our objective.  And we continue to see the data coming in, abstracting from the noise , in line with what we had expected, and continue to see a gradual pickup over the next several years toward our 2 percent objective.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Robi n Harding from the Financial Times .  Madam Chair, could you comment a little bit more on the decline in the long -run interest rate projection?  Is that more to do with temporary headwinds from the recovery or is it something more permanent about the    econom y?  And is this it, this decline to 3.75 percent ?  Or do you think there \u2019s potential for this rate to go lower yet?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, you do see a very slight decline this time in the C ommittee \u2019s longer -term normal rate of interest projections.  You know, I would caution you, however, we\u2019ve had turnover in the C ommittee \u2014two new participants who joined and are submitting projections and two who departed \u2014and that can create changes in the projections , small changes that are difficult to interpret.   But I think it\u2019 s fair to say there has been a slight decline.  And I think, you know, the most likely reason for that is there has been some slight decline, as I mentioned in my opening statement, of projec tions pertaining to longer -term growth, and typically estimates of the longer -run normal federal funds rate or short -term interest rates would move in  line with growth projections\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Ylan from the Washington Post .  My question is sort of the f lip side of Steve\u2019 s, and it\u2019 s about your outlook for unemployment.  Your predecessor has said that the Fed has been consistently too pessimistic about the level of the unemployment rate, and today, you guys lowered your outlook again.  Can you tell me a little bit more about how you see the unemployment rate evolving to meet your forecast?   Why you believe the rate of decline will start to level off?   And what an unexpected drop might mean for the first  rate hike.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, it\u2019 s true that unemploym ent has declined by more than the Committee expected and you do see a small downward revision in the C ommittee \u2019s projections, at least the central tendency for the unemployment rate.  Now, first of all, I mean, the labor market , I think, has continued to broadly improve.   We have seen continued job growth at a pace that is certainly sufficient to be diminishing labor market slack over time.   Over the last three months , for example, employment\u2014payroll employment \u2014has been rising around 230,000 jobs    per month and we \u2019re running close to 200,000 over the last year.  So, it\u2019 s in no way surprising to see a  decline in the unemployment rate.  That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a portion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perha ps not representing a diminution of slack in the labor market.  We have seen labor force participation rate decline.   And while I think most of us would agree that there has been and will continue to be secular decline in the labor force participation rate  for demographic reasons, I think a portion of the decline we\u2019ve seen in the unemployment rate probably reflects a kind of shadow unemployment or discouragement, a cyclical part of labor force participation.   Now, if that \u2019s correct, we may see that as the economy picks up steam and we see further recovery in the labor market, that those, let \u2019s call them discouraged workers, will return either to unemployment or to employment.   And as labor force participation begins to stabilize, the unemployment rate will come down less quickly.  And I think for a number of people, that \u2019s a component of the forecast.  You asked about implications for the path of policy and I would just say, the guidance that we \u2019ve given, our forward guidance , states that the timing of liftof f will depend on actual progress we see and the progress we expect to see going forward in terms of achieving both of our goals, namely maximum employment and our 2 percent inflation objective.  So, we \u2019re not going to look at any single indicator like the unemployment rate to assess how we \u2019re doing on meeting our employment goal ; we will look at a broad range of indicators.  That said, as I tried  to emphasize in my opening statement, there is uncertainty about monetary policy.  The appropriate path of policy, the timing in pace of interest rate increases, ought to and I believe will respond to unfolding economic developments.  If those were to prove faster than the C ommittee expects, it would be logical to expect a more rapid increase in the fed funds r ate.  But the opposite also holds true.  If we don \u2019t see the improvement that \u2019s projected in the baseline outlook, that the    opposite would be true and the pace of the timing and pace of interest rate increases would be later and more gradual.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:   Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, some Fed officials and some market commentators have noted that market conditions recently have looked a little bit like they did last spring before a period of turbulence.  Volatility is very  low in stock and bond markets.  Risk premiums are very low, and in particular, the market expectations for interest rates, for short -term interest rates look below even the Fed\u2019s own projections as laid out in your dot plot.  I wanted to ask two questions  related to that.  One, what is your read on these\u2014on market activity , and are you at all concerned about a sense of complacency in markets?  And , two, what is your view on market expectations for the rate hike cycle that the Fed has laid out in its dot pl ot?  Or, is the market where you think the Fed is on that?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I mean, I\u2019d start by saying that volatility , both actual and expected , in markets is at low levels.  The FOMC has no target for what the right level of volatility should be.  But to the extent that low levels of volatility may induce risk -taking behavior that , for example, entails excessive buildup in leverage or maturity extension, things that can pose risks to financial stability later on, that is a concern to me and to the C ommittee .  I don\u2019t know whether a number of reasons have been cited for what we \u2019re seeing in the marketplace.   I don\u2019 t know if overconfidence or complacency is one of those reasons.  But I guess I would say, it is important , as I emphasized in my opening statement , for market participants to recognize that there is uncertainty about what the path of interest rate s\u2014short -term rates \u2014will be.   And that \u2019s necessary because there\u2019 s uncertainty about what the path of the economy wi ll be.  And I want to emphasize , as I have, that the FOMC will adjust policy to what it actually sees unfolding in the economy over time , and that necessarily gives rise to a certain    level of uncertainty about what the path of rates will be.  And it is imp ortant for market participants to factor that into their decisionmaking.  You asked me about the dot plot \u2014our forecast , or our projections , for the f ed funds rate \u2014and you do see a range of disagreement among the participants there , so by the time you get t o 2016, there is a considerable range of opinion, and I think, in part, that reflects the uncertainty that I\u2019m talking about \u2014that participants do see different pace of recovery, different trajectories for inflation, and it\u2019 s appropriate for them to adjust their thinking about what the path of policy should be to their own view of how the economy will evolve over time.  And around each of those dots, I think every participant who \u2019s filling out that questionnaire has a considerable band of uncertainty around their own individual forecast.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Binya Appelbaum, New York Times .  You \u2019ve spoken about the sense that the recession has done permanent damage to the economic output and you\u2019ve reduced gradually over time your forecast of long -term growth .  I am curious to know to what extent you think stronger monetary and/or fiscal policy could reverse those trends.  Are we stuck with slower growth?  Is there something that you can do about it?  If so, what?  If not, why?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well , I think pa rt of the reason that we are seeing slower growth  in potential output may reflect the fact that capital investment has been very weak during the downturn in the long recovery that we \u2019re experiencing.   So, a diminished contribution from capital formation to  growth does make a negative contribution to growth.  And as the economy picks up, I certainly would hope to see that contribution restored.  So, I think that \u2019s one of the factors that \u2019s been operative.  Of course, we \u2019ve had unusually long duration unemplo yment.  A very large fraction of those unemployed have been unemployed for more than six months.  And there is the fear that those individuals find it harder to gain employment , that their attachment to    the labor force may diminish over time and the networ ks of contacts that are \u2014they have that are helpful in gaining employment can begin to erode over time.  We could see what \u2019s known as hysteresis , where individuals , because they haven \u2019t had jobs for a long time, find themselves permanently outside the labor force.  My hope would be that as \u2014and my expectation is that as the economy recovers, we will see some repair of that , that many of those individuals who were long-term unemployed or those who are now counted as out of the labor force would take jobs if the economy is stronger and would be drawn back in again, but it is conceivable that there is some permanent damage there to them, to their own well -being, their family \u2019s well -being, and the economy \u2019s potential.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Madam Chair.  I believe you mentioned in your opening remarks tighter credit, and I\u2019m wondering what you think of the possibility that the Federal Reserve itself , with the regulations it has to impose unde r Dodd -Frank , is partly responsible for that.  And , second, the current trend toward litigation.  I recently read something where just the three largest banks in the U.S. have paid $51 billion dollars in fine s so far, and obviously, the number is rising.  So, why would anybody loan to a near -prime borrower ?  And, in fact, if you look at Federal Reserve Bank of New York research, here we are, five years into the expansion, and people below FICO of 700 are having worse credit experiences.  So it probably isn \u2019t because, you know, unemployment\u2019s declining.  It\u2019s probably because banks simply don \u2019t want to take the risk.  So, as the nation\u2019 s top bank regulator, what can you do to fix that?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, I first would start by saying that I really think it\u2019 s essential in the aftermath of this crisis to strengthen financial regulation and to make the financial system more robust and to reduce systemic risk.  We can see what the costs of the financial crisis were and I don\u2019t think any of us should want to see that repeated.   So, I think the regulations that we \u2019ve put    in place, most of which follow from Dodd- Frank, are highly appropriate to create a more robust financial system that will be a safer and sounder one for our economy going forward, and I think we\u2019re making progress on doing that.  In putting regulations into place, we have tried to phase them in, in a way that gives long enough lead times to make sure that in strengthening the financial system, we don \u2019t produce a credit crunch.  A nd by and large, my own assessment is that credit is broadly available in the economy, but there are some exceptions , and I would agree with much of what you said when it comes to mortgage credit.  I think banks , at this point , are reluctant to lend to borrowers with lower FI CO scores.  They mention in meetings with us consistently their concerns about putback risk , and I think they are \u2014it is difficult for any homeowner who doesn \u2019t have pristine credit these days to get a mortgage.  I think that is one of the factors that is c ausing the housing recovery to be slow.  It\u2019s not the only one , but I would agree with that assessment.  And of course, you know, there were a lot of practices in connection with mortgage lending that really need ed to be changed, we don\u2019t want to go back t o those days, but it is important to clarify \u2014for us  to work to clarify the rules around mortgage lending to create an environment of greater certainty for lenders to be willing to extend mortgage credit.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Good afternoon, Jason Lange with Reute rs.  Chair Yellen, the Fed has slashed its growth projections for this year , and you\u2019ve gone to pains to explain that there is uncertainty in the path of interest rates in the economy , and yet the Fed central tendency projections for 2015 and 2016 remain quite strong.  Are you confident that the U.S. economy has entered a period of sustained above -trend economic growth?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, when you say \u201c confident,\u201d  I suppos e the answer is \u201c no\u201d because there is uncertainty, but I think there are many good reasons why we should see a period of sustained growth in excess of the economy \u2019s potential.  We have a highly accommodative    monetary policy.  We have diminishing fiscal dra g.  We have easing credit conditions.  We have households who are becoming more comfortable with their debt levels and more able to service that debt, an improving job market.  We have rising home prices and rising equity prices and an improving global economy , at least in my estimation.   So I think all of those things ought to be working to produce above -trend growth and I think that \u2019s what \u2019s reflected in the forecast.  But , nevertheless , as I said, of course there is uncertainty around that projection.  Y ou know, nevertheless, the labor market has continued to improve, and over a number of years in which, admittedly , growth has come in at a disappointing level, we \u2019ve still seen the labor market broadly improve , and I expect that to continue.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:   Steve Beckner with MNI, Madam Chair.  You mentioned that there were discussions of the mechanics of normalization, as you put it.  I assume that that involved some review of the \u2014it was the third anniversary of the June 2011 exit principles.  I wonder if I could get you to elaborate .  In particular, is the C ommittee reaching a consensus about the reinvestment and rollover policies, the timing of discontinuing those policies ?  And I\u2019d be interested in your personal view on that.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, reinvestment policy was included in our 2011 exit principles , and it\u2019 s one of the things that we are discussing and reconsidering.  We have not yet reached \u2014 we\u2019ve made quite a lot of progress in our discussion, but we \u2019ve not yet reached conclusions about that or other aspects of our package.  There are a couple of things Chairman Bernanke indicated , in contrast to our 2011 principles , that we would be very unlikely to sell mortgage -back ed securities , and that remains the case.  Broadly speaking, some of the principles that were incorporated in those \u2014in that 2011 package, the notion that we fully expect our balance sheet to shrink considerably over time back toward more normal levels, toward levels that would be    consistent with efficiently conducting mo netary policy, that \u2019s still an expectation.  I believe it\u2019 s an expectation that eventually our portfolio will be \u2014consist largely of T reasuries , eventually, but the re are quite a number of details.  We have a number \u2014as you know , a number of tools that we can deploy as we move to normalize policy :  interest on excess reserves, our overnight RRP facility, term repurchase agreements with the markets, our T erm D eposit F acility , and exactly how to deploy that set of tools to meet our objective of raising short \u2014the general level of short -term rates when the time becomes appropriate, and how best to communicate to the public and to markets how we are conducting policy and what our objectives are.  Those are things we \u2019re discussing and hope we will be able to come back with a full description, or let \u2019s think of it as a revised set of exit principles , later this year.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Madam Chair, Donna Borak with American Banker .

We still see that as one of the risks to the financial system that wasn \u2019t really addressed in the risk -based capital requirements that we put out or in the liquidity coverage ratio that \u2019s out for proposal.  Governor Tarullo has suggested one approach could be to impose a capital requirement that \u2019s related to reliance on wholes ale funding, and in my own past comments, I\u2019ve    been supportive, but I\u2019m afraid at this point \u2014and this remains very much on the table to take some action to address this \u2014it certainly remains  on the table as an unfinished agenda item, but I don\u2019t have a detailed timetable for you.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Would it be at some point before the end of the year , at least?

Second question is:  Will financial stability  considerations play a role in when and how fast the Committee normalizes interest rates?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So with respect to the question of overshooting, let me start by saying that inflation continues to run well below our objective, and we \u2019re still some  ways away from maximum employment.  A nd for the moment, I don\u2019 t see any tradeoff whatsoever in achieving our two objectives.  They both call for the same policy \u2014namely , a highly accommodative monetary policy.  So, at best, overshooting of inflation or the  thought that we will reach our inflation objective before we have attained maximum employment, I suppose I would see , at most , as a risk that we could face somewhere down the road.  Symmetrically, it\u2019 s also conceivably a risk that we would reach our maxim um employment objective before we \u2019ve actually attained our inflation objective.  So there are different ways in which we could    conceivably \u2014or there could conceivably arise policy conflicts or tradeoff s somewhere down the road.  Now, quite some time ago, the FOMC adopted, and we reaffirmed just in January , a statement on our longer -run goals and policy strategy .  And what that statement said is that, first of all, whenever either inflation or employment are away from their preferred or mandate -consistent l evels, it will always be the FOMC \u2019s policy to make sure that we get back to those target levels over the medium term.   But a principle that \u2019s embodied in that statement is that the Committee will follow a so -called balanced approach in deciding on its poli cies.  And , essentially, that means that when we see some conflict between achieving the two objectives , that we would consider in deciding on a policy just how far we are from achieving each of the objectives .  And if the distance from achieving an object ive is particularly large, it would be consistent with a  balanced approach that we would tolerate some movement in the opposite direction on the other objective.  But balanced approach is the general policy strategy I think we\u2019d follow.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  I\u2019d like to ask you about your signaling mechanism going forward.  At this point you haven \u2019t decided on reinvestments.  You \u2019ve told people , don\u2019 t pay any attention to the dot plot, and your two mandates, inflation and unemployment, are backward- looking lagging indicators.  So, if something should surprise in the economy with only four SEPs and press conferences a year, how do you signal to the markets what the Fed is doing so that you don\u2019 t run the risk of  an event like last September when people were surprised, or some sort of credibility problem where people feel you\u2019re falling behind the economy?   \n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  Well, you know, again, we are very attentive to unfolding economic developments and understand that there can be surprises and twists and turns in the road, so that the forecasts that we \u2019ve made become no longer appropriate and we need to respond to unfol ding developments.  I\u2019m personally committed to communicating with the public whenever communication is appropriate.  We have four press conferences, but I would feel it appropriate for me to either have additional communications meetings with the press or  to give speeches or to, in a variety of opportunities I have , to make clear what the C ommittee \u2019s thinking is , and my colleagues as well , I think, would feel it entirely appropriate to communicate changes \u2014changes in our views.

Do you think\u2014is financial stability currently preventing the Fed from being more accommodative than it would like?  And if not, when do you expect that to happen, if at all?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, let me \u2014I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019 t answer the last part of Greg \u2019s question and the last part of yours.  Let me start there.  With respect to financial stability, we monitor    potential threats to financial stability very , very  carefully, and we have spoken about some \u2014I\u2019ve spoken in recent congressional testimonies and speeches about some threats to financial stability that are on our radar screen , that we are monitoring.  Trends in leverage d lending and the underwriting standards there, diminished risk spreads in lower -grade corporate bonds \u2014high -yield bonds \u2014have certainly caught our attention.  There is some evidence of reach -for-yield behavior.  That \u2019s one of the reasons I mentioned that this environment of low volatility is very much on my radar screen and would be a conce rn to me if it prompted an increase in leverage or other kinds of risk- taking behavior that could unwind in a sharp way and provoke a sharp, for example, jump in interest rates.   And we \u2019ve seen what effect that can have on the global economy, and I think i t\u2019s something that it\u2019 s important to avoid.   But broadly speaking, if the question is , to what extent is monetary policy , at this time , being driven by financial stability concerns , I would say that \u2014well, I would never take off the table that monetary policy should\u2014could, in some circumstances , respond.  I don \u2019t see them shaping monetary policy in an important way right now.  I don\u2019 t see a broad -based increase in leverage, rapid increase in credit growth or maturity transformation, the kinds of broad tr ends that would suggest to me that the level of financial stability risks has risen above a moderate level.  And we are using supervisory tools and regulations both to make the financial system more robust and to pay particular attention to areas where we \u2019ve spotted concerns , like leveraged lending, which is very much a focus of our supervision.  Now, let \u2019s see.   There was a first part to your question, and the first part was about global risks, and we always pay attention to global risks and the likely evol ution of the global economy.  You expressed a lot of pessimism about emerging markets, and I see it more likely that we \u2019ll see moderate growth and a pickup there.  Of course, there are geopolitical risks \u2014the Middle East ,    developments in Iraq, of course.  T hey\u2019re not only a humanitarian concern; they are a concern with respect , potentially , to energy supplies and prices, and so I would certainly list that as something in the category of risks to the outlook.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Barnes with Fox Business, ma \u2019am.  Can I \u2014just to follow up a little bit on what Pedro asked about.  Specifically, what about equity markets?  I mean, right now, today, the S&P 500 is on track to close at a \u2014another record high.  You have said that you have not seen any evidence of bubbles in equity markets, and that they have been trading within historic norms.  Is that still the case today?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  So I don\u2019 t have a sense\u2014the Committee doesn\u2019 t try to gauge what is the right level of equity prices.  But we do certain ly monitor a number of different metrics that give us a feeling for where valuations are relative to things like earnings or dividends, and look at where these metrics stand in comparison with previous history to get a sense of whether or not we\u2019re moving to valuation levels that are outside of historical norms, and I still don\u2019 t see that.   I still don\u2019 t see that for equity prices broadly.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Annalyn Kurtz with CNNMoney.  Thank you, Chair Yellen.  I\u2019m wondering:  What \u2019s the Fed \u2019s general expect ation for wage growth this year and next year?  And if inflation outpaces wage growth, does that scenario make you more hesitant to raise the federal funds rate next year?   Or if, conversely, wages rise just enough to keep up with inflation, they \u2019re moving in lockstep, let \u2019s say, is that enough to satisfy what you\u2019re looking for in the  job market?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, thanks.  That \u2019s a great question.  You know, I see compensation growth, broadly speaking , as having been very well contained.   By most  measures, compensation growth is running around 2 percent.  So that \u2019s real wage growth or real compensation growth that \u2019s essentially flat rather than rising, and real wage growth really has    not been rising in line with productivity.  My own expectation i s that as the labor market begins to tighten, we will see wage growth pick up some to the point where real wage growth, where compensation or nominal wages are rising more rapidly than inflation, so households are getting a real increase in their take -home  pay.  And within limits \u2014well, that might be signs of a tighter labor market.  Within limits, it\u2019 s not a threat to inflation because consistent with the level of inflation we have for our 2 percent inflation objective, we could see wages growing at a more rapid rate and\u2014a somewhat more rapid rate\u2014a nd, indeed, that would be part of my forecast of what we would see as the labor market picks up.  If we were to fail to see that, frankly , I would worry about downside risk to consumer spending.  So I think part of my confidence in  the fact that we \u2019ll see a pickup in growth relates to the fact that I think consumer spending will continue to grow at a healthy rate.  And , in part, that \u2019s premised on some pickup in the rate of wage growth so that it\u2019 s rising greater \u2014more than inflation\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.   Today \u2019s statement repeated a phrase that \u2019s been used \u2014that the C ommittee has been using , that there\u2019 s likely to be a \u201cconsiderable \u201d period between the end of the bond purchases and the first hike in the federal funds rate.  In March, you gave us some guidance to help\u2014trying to help us to understand that by saying that that\u2014it\u2019 s hard to define, but it could mean six months.  Is that a time  frame that you feel \u2014still feel comfortable with?   And , if you feel like it needs to be modified, do you\u2014could you give us an assessment of \u2014the market seemed to expect a rate, the first rate hike in the second half of next year .  Is that a good assessment?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So what I want to say, the guidance that I want to give you, is that there is no mechanical formula whatsoever for what a \u201c considerable time \u201d means.  The answer as to what it means is , it depends.  It depends on how the economy progresses.  The C ommittee said    very clearly in their s tatement that what they would be looking at and deciding on the timing of interest rate increases would be the progress we \u2019re making in achieving our objectives, how far we are from achieving our labor market objective and our inflation objective , and that  we will be assessing that progress, and that \u2019s the key determinant of when interest rate increases are likely to come.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Next year?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: There is no mechanical formula.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.

The re was a report this week , in a salmon -colored newspaper I won \u2019t mention , that the Fed is thinking about \u2014and regulators in Washington are thinking about \u2014an exit fee for bond mutual funds.  This has sparked a lot of comments.  Would you care to comment on t his?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: .

The Committee's actions reflect their assessment that the economy is making progress towards maximum employment and price stability, with further improvements in the labor market and signs of expansion in private domestic final demand.The FOMC believes that the economy is rebounding and will continue to expand at a moderate pace, with sufficient strength to support improvement in the labor market. However, they remain cautious about inflation running below their objective and expect it to gradually move back towards its target.The FOMC projects that real GDP growth will remain above normal levels for the next two years. They also expect inflation to gradually increase towards 2 percent as the economy expands. The Committee has decided to reduce the pace of asset purchases by $10 billion per month, reflecting their expectation of continued progress towards their economic objectives. However, future reductions in purchases will depend on the Committee's outlook for jobs and inflation, as well as the effectiveness and costs of such purchases.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will consider a wide range of information, including labor market conditions, inflation pressures, and financial developments, in determining interest rate policy. Based on the current assessment, the FOMC anticipates maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percent goal. However, once policy accommodation is removed, the target federal funds rate may remain below normal levels for some time due to the residual effects of the financial crisis.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is discussing the mechanics of normalizing monetary policy, but wants to make it clear that these discussions do not indicate any imminent changes. The Committee is confident in its ability to raise and control short-term interest rates, and is focusing on determining the appropriate tools and implications for the normalization process.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Does the recent higher inflation rate suggest that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve on inflation and what is the tolerance for higher inflation?\n'ANSWER': Recent inflation readings have been on the high side, but they are considered noisy. Inflation is evolving in line with the Committee's expectations and there is a gradual return towards the 2 percent objective. The Committee's inflation projections have not changed significantly.", "'QUESTION': What about the tolerance for higher inflation?\n'ANSWER': The Committee remains committed to the 2 percent inflation objective and does not want to see inflation persistently running below or above this target. The data is in line with expectations and indicates a gradual increase towards the 2 percent objective over the next few years.", "'QUESTION': Could you comment on the decline in the long-run interest rate projection? Is it due to temporary headwinds or something more permanent about the economy? Is this the lowest it will go?\n'ANSWER': There has been a slight decline in the Committee's longer-term normal rate of interest projections. This could be due to turnover in the Committee and changes in growth projections. It is difficult to interpret, but it is likely that the decline is related to the slight decline in longer-term growth projections.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain how you see the unemployment rate evolving and why you believe the rate of decline will level off?\n'ANSWER': Unemployment has declined more than expected, but some of the decline may not represent a true improvement in the labor market. The decline in the unemployment rate could be due to discouraged workers who may return to unemployment or employment as the economy improves. The timing and pace of interest rate increases will depend on the progress towards achieving maximum employment and inflation goals.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed's view on market activity and market expectations for interest rate hikes?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is concerned about low volatility inducing risk-taking behavior that could pose risks to financial stability. There is uncertainty about the path of interest rates and the economy, and the Fed will adjust policy accordingly. The dot plot reflects a range of opinions and uncertainty among participants.", "QUESTION: To what extent do you think stronger monetary and/or fiscal policy could reverse the trends of slower economic growth and permanent damage caused by the recession?\n\nANSWER: The slower growth in potential output may be due to weak capital investment during the downturn. As the economy picks up, the contribution from capital formation to growth should be restored. Long-term unemployment and the erosion of networks of contacts could lead to permanent damage, but a stronger economy could draw individuals back into the labor force.", "'QUESTION': What can the Federal Reserve do to address the tighter credit and the trend towards litigation in the banking industry?\n'ANSWER': The regulations put in place, following Dodd-Frank, are necessary to strengthen the financial system and reduce systemic risk. The Federal Reserve has tried to phase in regulations to avoid a credit crunch. While credit is broadly available, banks are reluctant to lend to borrowers with lower credit scores, particularly in the mortgage market. Clarifying the rules around mortgage lending can create a more certain environment for lenders to extend credit.", "'QUESTION': Are you confident that the U.S. economy has entered a period of sustained above-trend economic growth?\n'ANSWER': I am not confident because there is uncertainty, but there are many reasons why we should see sustained growth. We have accommodative monetary policy, diminishing fiscal drag, easing credit conditions, improving job market, rising home and equity prices, and an improving global economy. However, there is still uncertainty and the labor market has continued to improve despite disappointing growth.", "'QUESTION': Is the Committee reaching a consensus on the reinvestment and rollover policies and the timing of discontinuing those policies?\n'ANSWER': The Committee is discussing and reconsidering the reinvestment policy, but no conclusions have been reached yet. Chairman Bernanke indicated that selling mortgage-backed securities is unlikely. The expectation is for the balance sheet to shrink over time, consisting mostly of Treasuries, but there are still many details to be worked out. The Committee is also considering various tools and communication strategies for normalizing policy. A revised set of exit principles is expected later this year.", "'QUESTION': Why has it taken so long for the Fed to propose a rule on handling the risk related to short-term wholesale funding?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen explains that while they have been supportive of addressing the issue, there is no detailed timetable for when the rule will be implemented. They see heavy reliance on short-term funding as a risk to the financial system that has not been adequately addressed in previous regulations.", "'QUESTION': How would the Committee respond if inflation temporarily moved above target before achieving full employment? Will financial stability considerations play a role in normalizing interest rates?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen is uncertain about the timing of these events and does not have a detailed timetable. However, she acknowledges the suggestion by John Williams and the IMF to allow temporary inflation overshoot for faster employment improvement. Financial stability considerations will also be taken into account when normalizing interest rates.", "'QUESTION': How would the Committee respond if inflation temporarily moved above target before achieving full employment? Will financial stability considerations play a role in normalizing interest rates?\n'ANSWER': Inflation is currently below our objective and we are still far from maximum employment. There is no tradeoff between achieving both objectives at the moment. Overshooting inflation or reaching maximum employment before our inflation objective could be risks in the future. The Committee follows a balanced approach, considering the distance from achieving each objective when making policy decisions.", "'QUESTION': How does the Fed plan to signal its actions to the markets in order to avoid surprises and maintain credibility?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is attentive to economic developments and understands that forecasts may become inappropriate. Chair Yellen is committed to communicating with the public through press conferences, speeches, and other opportunities to make the Committee's thinking clear. The Fed is also aware of global economic challenges and does not believe the US can be the sole engine of global recovery. The issue of financial stability is not addressed in the response.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the U.S. can be a lone engine of economic recovery globally? And is financial stability currently preventing the Fed from being more accommodative?\n'ANSWER': The U.S. pays attention to global risks and the likely evolution of the global economy. While there are concerns about emerging markets and geopolitical risks, the Fed believes there will be moderate growth and a pickup in emerging markets. Financial stability is monitored carefully, but it is not currently preventing the Fed from being more accommodative.", "'QUESTION': What is the current assessment of equity markets and their valuation levels?\n'ANSWER': The Committee does not determine the appropriate level of equity prices, but monitors various metrics to assess valuations relative to earnings or dividends. Based on historical norms, there is no evidence of equity prices moving outside of normal ranges.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed's expectation for wage growth and how does it affect the decision to raise the federal funds rate?\n'ANSWER': Compensation growth is currently around 2%, which is essentially flat. As the labor market tightens, wage growth is expected to pick up, exceeding inflation. This is not a threat to inflation and is part of the forecast for a stronger labor market. Failure to see this growth could pose downside risks to consumer spending.", "'QUESTION': Is the timeframe of six months still accurate for the \"considerable period\" between the end of bond purchases and the first rate hike?\n'ANSWER': The timeframe of six months is not a mechanical formula for the \"considerable period.\" The timing of interest rate increases depends on the progress of the economy, specifically in achieving labor market and inflation objectives. The Committee will assess this progress to determine when rate hikes are likely to occur.", "'QUESTION': Next year?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen stated that there is no mechanical formula for predicting what will happen next year.", "'QUESTION': Would you care to comment on the report about the Fed considering an exit fee for bond mutual funds?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen stated that she is not aware of any discussion on this topic within the Federal Reserve and believes it falls under the jurisdiction of the SEC."]}
