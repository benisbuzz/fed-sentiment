"question_answer": [["\nREPORTER: Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Chair Yellen,  there \u2019s been extraordinary progress during your term as Chair in lowering  several measures of unemployment and underemployment , and all while inflation has remained subdued.  B ut some people are even asking , why stop there ?  Bill Spriggs , the chief economist at  the AFL -CIO, who I think you know well, criticized the F ed last week for seeking to maintain unemployment above 4 percent , which he notes necessarily means keeping the unemployment rate among black Americans above 8 percent .  He described this as a deliberate policy to sacrifice many h undreds   of thousands of potential workers and their families out of fear of future inflation, when in fact the Fed \u2019s preferred measure of inflation has not exceed ed 3 per cent in more than 25 years.  So I\u2019m wondering how you would respond to his frustration over the Fed \u2019s desire to continue raising rates when core inflation really shows no sign of heading above the Fed \u2019s symmetric goal for inflation.  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  So let me first say that employment is a very important part of our mandate.  We \u2019re charged by Congress with trying to pursue maximum employment, and we have taken that very seriously.  I\u2019m very pleased and heartened by the i mprovement we have seen in the labor market, and  at 4.4 percent, t he unemployment rate has  really fallen to quite a low level.  As that \u2019s happened, the unemployment rates for less advantaged groups in the labor m arket , particularly African  Americans and Hispanics, ha s fallen more dramatically than that for the nation as a whole, reversing the outsized increases that those groups experienced when the financial crisis and G reat R ecession hit.  A nd these are really very positive development s.  So we certainly seek a strong labor m arket, but we have a dual mandate, which is inflation and unemployment , and we also have to be mindful of our obligation to achieve a  2 percent inflation objective over the medium term. Now, I recognize and it \u2019s important that inflation has been running under our 2 percent objective for a number of years , and that is a concern, particularly if it were to translate into lower inflation expectations.  For a number of years there were very understandable reasons for that shortfall, and they included quite a lot of slack in the labor m arket \u2014which , my judgment would be , has largely disappeared \u2014very large reductions in energy prices , and a large appreciation of the dollar that lowered import prices starting in mid -2014.  This year, the   shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, when none of those factors is operative , is more of a mystery, and I will not say that the C ommittee clearly understands what the causes are of that.  Now, we do , in our regular projection, show fan charts indicating the typical size of forecast errors .  All of the variables \u2014GDP, t he unemploymen t rate , and inflation \u2014are forecast by ourselves and private forecasters with errors , and so there is variation in these economic variables fro m year to year.  I would say our  judgment , as I said in the statement, is that the shortfall is not largely relate d to cyclical considerations.  You can see from the projections that the C ommittee participants submitted that we anticipate that core and headline inflation will move up close to our 2 percent objective next year \u2014namely , that the shortfall this year is du e to transitory factors that are likely to disappear over the course of the coming year . But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent .  And as we watch incoming data, the assessments that you see participants wr ite down about the path of the federal funds r ate, they are not set in stone .  They are not definite plans.  We will look at incoming data on inflation and on other economic variables, including the labor m arket , in deciding what we should actually do going f orward .  And if it proves contrary to our expectations that the shortfall is persistent, it will be necessary to adjust monetary policy to address that.  But I want to point out that while there are risks that inflation could continue below 2 percent, whic h we need to take account of in monetary policy , monetary policy also operates with a  lag.  And experience suggests that tightness in the labor  market , gradually and with a  lag, tends to push up wage and price inflation, and that \u2019s also a risk , that we want to be careful not to allow the economy to overheat in a way that would force us later on, somewhere do wn the road, to have to tighten m onetary policy rapidly , which could cause a recession a nd threaten the very desirable labor m arket conditio ns that we have now. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming  from the Financial Times .  The Fed\u2019s staff spoke recently about  elevated asset prices in the mark ets in the most recent \u2014in the  meeting  before th is one held today.  How are buoyant market conditions affecting the debate at the moment about how quickly to rein in stimulus?  And have they , in your own mind, helped to counter some of the concerns you\u2019ve had about the inflation s hortfalls that we \u2019ve been seeing ?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  So at  every  meeting  we try to assess the economic o utlook and take account of information that \u2019s been accumulated about the real economy and also developments in financial markets and put all of that together in assessing the course of the economy.  So developments affecting asset prices and longer -term interest rates, the exchange rate\u2014all of those aspects of financial conditions factor into our thinking . But it\u2019 s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall outlook.  Sometimes mo vements \u2014upward movements in asset prices can,  for example, reflect a change in market participants \u2019\u2014reduction in market participants \u2019 estimates of the longer -run level of interest rates.  So there has been \u2014there have been downward revisions both to the Committee \u2019s and to market participants \u2019 estimates of the longer -run normal level of interest rates , which in turn reflects in some sense a  view that , going out many years , aggregate demand globally is likely to be weakened by continuing low productivity growt h and aging populations .  And, of course , we don\u2019 t know if that view is correct, but that \u2019s a factor that could be reflected \u2014could be one reason why asset prices have moved as they have.  So , you know, why are asset prices moving ?  That\u2019s important in dete rmining the impact on the overall outlook, but , certainly , we are taking account of movements in asset prices in evaluating the appropriate stance of policy. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Steve Liesman , CNBC.  Madam C hair, you just said in your opening remarks that reducing the balance sheet sh ould not be \u201c an active tool for monetary policy in normal times, \u201d you don\u2019 t plan to make adjustments to the balance  sheet .  I\u2019m wondering if we could explore if there \u2019s any sensitivity to the plan you just announced if there \u2019s a spike in interest rates, a plunge i n the stock market, weakness in  growth.  In the June statement , you indicated that the only reason why you would change the \u2014it suggested  the only reason you\u2019d change the balance sheet is if it required , first , a change i n the funds rate.  Is that true ?  If there \u2019s some unexpected development in markets , or, for example, given that we don\u2019 t know what the plans are on the fiscal side for the deficit in terms of tax cuts\u2014there could be a sudden spike in the deficit \u2014will the balance sheet reduction plan be immune to all of that ?  And, given t hat question, and the idea that  this has  never been done before, why so much certainty about the plan you\u2019ve just announced and apparent unwillingness to adjust it?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we have two policy tools that are available to us to use:  the balance sheet and adjustments in  short -term interest rates \u2014our  federal funds rate target .  And, historically , the C ommittee has  operated t o adjust monetary conditions to meet our economic goals when there are shocks to the economy by adjusting  the federal funds r ate\u2014our  short -term interest rate target.  And that \u2019s something \u2014a technique of monetary control that we  have  used for a very long time that we are familiar with, we believe we understa nd pretty well what  the effects are on the economy, market participants understand how that tool has been used and would likely be adjusted in response to shocks to the economy .  And our preference is , when we have two different tools that we could use to actively adjust the stance of policy, to  prefer and to make a commitment that, to t he maximum extent possible , the federal funds r ate will be the   active tool of policy.  That \u2019s our go- to tool .  That is what we intend to use unless we think that the threat to the economy is sufficiently great that we might have to cut the federal funds rate\u2014after all , we\u2019ve moved it up to 1 to 1\u00bc percent  and expect it to go up further \u2014but a very significant negativ e shock to the economy could conceivably force us bac k to the so- called zero lower bound.  We have said if there were that type of  material deterioration in the o utlook where we cou ld face a situation where the federal funds r ate isn \u2019t a su fficient tool fo r us to adjust monetary p olicy, we might stop\u2014we might stop r oll-offs from our balance sheet and resume reinvestment .  But as long as we believe that we can use the federal funds rate as a tool , that is what we intend to do. So, if there are small changes in the outlook t hat require a recalibration of monetary policy, we will change our anticipated path and setting of the federal funds rate, but not , for example, change the caps on reinvestment or stop \u2014continue  reinvestment for a few months and then change it.  We think that provides greater clarity to market participants about how policy will be conducted and will be , will be  less confusing and more eff ective in terms of conducting policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Binya Appelbaum , the New York Times .  You  have  now committed to a policy of reducing your balance sheet very gradually.  You have described plans to raise interest rates even more gradually than previously.  You are locked in for a long period of time to a forecast that monetary p olicy will essentiall y keep interest rates at a low level and keep a balance sheet at a high level.  If something goes wrong , does the F ed have room to respond under these conditions in the next several years , and could you describe for us what your plans are for a response , should it be warranted?  \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So the only t hing I would object to there , is you said that we are \u201clocked in,\u201d  and I would say that we are not locked in.  We believe that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in  our federal funds rate target, but if conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be \u2014it mig ht be that growth is more rapid, t he labor m arket tightens more quickly than we assume, an d inflation appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected \u2014we have not promised, no matter what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual.  We believe that that will be appropriate , but we  always watching the economy and  will adjust policy as appropriate.  Now, as I said, the hurdle to changing our plans with respect to the balance sheet , in some sense , is high.  If conditions were to weaken, we  would really only consider resuming reinvestment if it were what we refer to as a material deterioration , and I tried to explain why that is .  But, you know, we will adjust monetary policy .  What you see in the dot plot is each participant \u2019s best guess, based on the information they have today , about what will be appropriate in light of their expectations about how the econom y would evolve .  And we think it\u2019s helpful to show the public some sense that it helps in understanding our evaluation of the economy .  But we \u2019re assessing incoming data, and these p lans are subject to change.  W hat\u2019s not subject to change is our commitmen t to doing everything in our power to achieve the goals that Congress has  assigned to u s, which are price stability or 2 percent inflation and maximum employment.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Do you, in fact , have room in the next two or three years to respond to an economic downturn?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So , certainly , if growth is stronger or if inflation picks up more rapidly , we have room.  We have a certain amount of room now , and we have raised the funds   rate four times.   We believe that we are on a path where ther e will likely be further increases over the next couple of years, which will give us greater room , and we think the recovery is on a strong track.  So the reason for our actions today in beginning to run down the balance sheet is, we think the economy is performing well and we have confidence in the outlook for the real economy .  But, of course , there are shocks , and if the negative shock to the economy were sufficient, we recognize that we might be unable to pursue objective s purely by cutting the federal funds r ate, and that is why we say explicitly that we would be prepared , in that event, to resume reinvestment , and other tools that we used in the financial crisis \u2014forward guidance \u2014would also be available to us\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Nick Timiraos  of the  Wall S treet Journal .  Chair Yellen , Fed Governor Lael Brainard recently gave a speech in which she said trend inflation appeared to have moved lower by around \u00bd percentage point.  I wanted to ask , do you agree?  And what would the F ed need to do , if anything , to boost trend inflation if it has  fallen?  And , related to that, you\u2019ve said you expect the inflation softness this year to prove \u201c transitory. \u201d  Compared to three months ago, how firm is your curr ent expectation that the slowdown will remain transitory , and what implications would that have for monetary policy if it is  not\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So the term \u201c trend inflation \u201d\u2014usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.   Exactly what that means is, in some sense , a statistical thing, and there are methodologies that would show some modest decline in recent year s in the trend.  After all, we\u2019ve had a numbe r of years in which inflation has  been low.  As I said in answer to an earlier question, I think if you g o back to, s ay, 2013 and consider the \u2014until this year, the reasons why inflation was low are not hard to understand.  It\u2019s a combination   of slack in the labor m arket, declines in energ y prices, and a strong dollar that pulled down import price inflation. So what \u2019s important in determining inflation going forward is inflation expectations.  By some \u2014by many\u2014by some survey measures of professional forecasters, those have been rock solid.  We do also look at household expectations, which have come down some.  Market -based measures of inflation c ompensation, as we mentioned in the statement \u2014they have declined, and they\u2019ve been stable in recent months, but they \u2019ve declined to levels that are low by historical standards.  That might suggest that inflation expectations have come down, but one can\u2019 t get a clear read \u2014the re are risk premia built into inflation c ompensation that make it impossible to extract directly what inflation expectations are.  So, you know, there is a miss this year .  I can \u2019t say I can easily poin t to a sufficient set of factors that explain this year why inflation has been this  low.  I\u2019ve mentioned a few idiosyncratic things, but , frankly, the low inflation is more broad based than just idiosyncratic things.  The fact that inflation is unusually l ow this year does not mean that that \u2019s going to continue.  Remember that in January and February, core inflation was running over a 12- month basis at around 1.9 percent, and we look to be very close to 2 now.  We \u2019ve had several months of data that have meaningfully pulled that down, and what we need to do is  figure out whether or not the factors that have lowered inflation are likely to prove persistent or they \u2019re likely to prove transitory, and that\u2019s what we \u2019re going to try to be determining on the basis of incoming data . And you asked me about the policy implications.  Of course, if we determined our view changed, and instead of thinking that the factors holding inflation down were transitory , we came to the view that they would be persistent, it would re quire an alteration in monetary policy to move inflation back up to 2 percent, and we would be committed to making that adjustment.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Ann Saphir with Reuters.  I wanted to ask you, market s seem to be pricing in still a shallow er path of rate  hikes than the F ed does in the SEP, and I wonder , what do you think that markets might be missing here , and, sort of , what \u2019s your conviction about, you know, that your view is the correct one on the gradual \u2014the pace that \u201c gradual \u201d means, which seems to be a little bit faster than what markets are pricing?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I \u2019m not really going to try to explain what market participants are thinking.  I thin k all of us \u2014both market and FOM C participant s\u2019 paths have come down.  N ot in the last couple of quart ers, but over the last several years , there\u2019 s been a growing recognition that the so -called neutral interest rate, consistent with the economy operating at maximum employment, that that rate seems to have come down, and most of the economic papers and  research bearing on this topic suggest that it \u2019s quite low.  Market \u2014SEP \u2014the FOMC participants \u2014you can see by their estimates of the longer -run normal rate of interest, it is \u2014this time it came down from\u2014the median came down from  3 percent to 2.75 percent.  So that shows that even in the long run, FOM C participants, in light of incoming data, are adjusting their views.  I would say they still believe that,  in real terms, that neutral rate will be rising somewhat over the next few years .  With a 2 percent inflati on rate , that long-run estimate in real terms amounts to 75 basis points, which is higher than the zero or slightly positive rates now.  So that \u2019s one factor that explains the path in the SEP.  Market participants may have lower estimates or believe that a low neutral rate may be more persistent.  I mean, let me emphasize that , as I said before, there\u2019 s nothing set in stone about the policy paths that you see in the summary of projections .  There\u2019 s a great deal of uncertainty around them.  Not only is there disagreement, th ere\u2019s also uncertainty, and FOM C participants have been revising their views over time, and they wi ll continue to do so.    I\u2019d also point out a couple of technical reasons why it \u2019s difficult to compare what you see in the SEP and marke t-implied paths.  One is that FOM C participants are writing down what they think is the most  likely , or modal , outcome for rates .  But, of course , there are downside risks .  And the mean rate , if they were asked to write that down, would take account of weighing all possible outcomes and likely would be lower than what participants are writing down as the ir most likely outcome.  In addition, in markets , many economists have suggested that there  are term premia that can affect moving from the so -called market -implied path to the view for what the future federal funds rate path is, and if those term premia are negative , as many economists think they likely are, there \u2019s a little bit less difference  between what you see in the FOMC plot and the market -implied  plot\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks.  Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A. Times .  Chair Yellen, your term expires as C hair in February .  Have you had a chance to meet with or discuss your situation with Pr esident Trump yet?

I will say that I have not had a further meeting with President Trump.  I met with him early in my term, and I \u2019ve not had a  further meeting with him.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Adam Shapiro, Fox Business.  Chair Yellen , a month ago you delivered a speech in Wyoming in which you said, \u201cT he balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth. \u201d  I have a two-part question based on that  quote.  First,                                                  1 Chair Yellen intended to say that she met with President Trump early in his term.    what message do you want Congress and President Trump to hear from that statement?  And then, regarding economic growth, the accommodative process that the F ed has followed for the last 10 years has helped bri ng us to full employment, but economists point out that there have been people who haven \u2019t benefited .  For instance , 52 percent of Americans own stock , 48 percent don \u2019t\u2014they\u2019ve not participated in the gains in the stock market.   Housing prices \u2014the median h ouse price is now at a record high, and 39 million Americans , according to a Harvard study, spend more than 30 percent for housing.  So what would you say to those people about Fed policies and the impact they \u2019ve had on their lives?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Okay.  So you asked me , what was the main \u2014first , what was the main message of my speech, and I would say it \u2019s that we put in place, since the financial crisis, a set of core reforms that have strengthened the financial system, and , in my personal view, it \u2019s impor tant they remain in place .

He \u2019s made enormous contributions to t he FOMC  and to the broader work of the Federal Reserve, and I have real ly enjoyed working with him and appreciated his wise counsel and friendship.  It is conceivable that we will be down to three Governors.  I have full confidence that even if that happens, we will be able to carry out our compleme nt of responsibilities.  Th ere\u2019s\u2014every action that we are allowed to take under the Federal Reserve Act can be taken, even if we are a B oard of three , although we will have to abide, as we always do, by the restrictions that are part  of the Government  in the Sunshine  Act.  I would welcome a full complement of colleagues.  We have a lot of work to do, and it would be nice to distribute it over more people .  But, perhaps more important than that, I think it\u2019s very important to have a broad range of views around the table as we  deliberate on policy actions.  I\u2019ve had very good interactions with Randy Quarl es and hope he will be confirmed.  I look forward to working with him , and, you know, I hope that the Administration will make other nominations to fill our slots. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Heather Long from the Washington Post .  As you know, Congress is considering a major tax reform package.  Do you or any of the C ommittee members have concerns if that package does not end up being deficit neutral and ends up adding to the debt?

You know, I \u2019ve put forward  a few principles about fiscal policy that I would reiterate, that one of the problems that the  American economy suffers from, along with many other economies around the globe, is slow productivity growth, and I think it would be very desirable if a fiscal package had the potential in it to create incentives that would raise productivity growth.  We do face, in terms of longer -term deficits as the population ages, an unsustainable debt path that will require, I beli eve, some adjustments to fiscal p olicy, and I hope Congress will keep that in mind .

We take our supervision responsibilities at the company very seriously, and we are attempting to understand what the root causes of those problems a re and to address them .  I\u2019m not able to discuss confidential supervisory information and not yet able to tell you what actions we may take, but I do want to say that we are committed   to taking the actions we regard as necessary and appropriate to make sur e that the right set of controls are in place in that organization\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Can you give me any kind of a timeline?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: We are working very hard on it \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, thank you.  David Harrison with Dow Jones.  I\u2019d like to follow  up on the balance s heet question , if I may.  What specifically would it take for you to reverse the decision to wind down the balance s heet, and under what conditions would you consider adding to the balance s heet again ?  And s eparately , as a follow -up to that, looking more broadly, how do you think history will judge the effectiveness of your asset purchases an d the conditions under which that  policy should be used?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So , starting with the last part of the question, I mean, my own judgment, based on my experience and  the economic research that has tried to estimate the effectiveness of our balance s heet actions starting in 2008 and has also looked at the similar balance s heet actions in other parts of the world, including the  euro area, is that these actions were successful in making financial conditions more accommodative and , I believe, in stimulating a faster recovery than we otherwise would ha ve had .  A recent Fed working paper estimated that the full set of balance s heet actions that we took during the crisis may have lowered long -term interest rates by about 100 basis points.  O bviously , there are different \u2014there are different estimates around\u2014of what  difference it made, but I would say that it \u2019s effective.  It will b e up to future policymakers to decide, in the event of a severe downturn, whether they think it \u2019s appropriate to again resort to balance sheet \u2014to adding assets to a balance sheet.  I would say that if economists are correct that we\u2019 re living in a world w here the level of neutral interest rates not only in the United States, but around the world is likely to be low in the future   due to slow productivity growth and demographics \u2014now , we don\u2019 t know that that view will bear out to be correct, but it is a view th at many people adhere to when there is evidence of it \u2014then future policymakers will be faced with the question of, in the event of a severe downturn where they \u2019re not able to provide as much stimulus as they would ideally like by cutting overnight interest  rates, what other actions are available to them ? And during the crisis , we bought longer -term assets and used forward guidance, and for my own part, I would want to keep those things in the toolkit as being available.  It will be up to future policymakers  to decide how to rank those, or whether or not there might be other options that are available to them, but I don\u2019 t think this issue will go away, although perhaps it \u2019s only \u2014well, this could well be a decision that future policymakers will have to face in  the event of a significant asset \u2014economic shock. I mean, you asked me what would it take for us to resume reinvestment, and I can\u2019 t really say much more than we said in the guidance that we provided, which is that if there is a material deterioration in the economic outlook and we thought we might be faced with a  situation where we would  need to substantially cut the f ederal f unds r ate and could be limited by the so -called zero lower bound, it is that type of determination that our C ommittee is saying would \u2014might lead us to resume reinvestment.  So that \u2019s\u2014our C ommittee has been unanimous  in affirming  this statement of intentions, so, y ou know, I think that \u2019s where our C ommittee stands .  So that is a somewhat high bar to resume reinvestments, and that \u2019s why , in answering previous questions, I would say , well, yo u know, if there\u2019s  some small, negative  shock, our first tool \u2014our most import ant and reliable tool\u2014will be the federal funds r ate.  B ut if there is a significant shock that\u2019s a  material deterioration to the outlook, we would consider resuming reinvestment.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Chair Yellen .  Victoria Guida with Politico.  You \u2019ve been on the Financial Stability Oversight Council for a few years now, and I was wondering if you had any thoughts on whether the designation process for S ystemically Important F inancial Institutions  should be changed or improved in any way .  And a somewh at separate, but related , question:   The situation with Equifax \u2014I was wondering if there \u2019s anything related to that that might raise systemic issues that FSOC  would need to discuss\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So you asked first about the designation process.  So during the time that I \u2019ve been on the FSOC, only one firm was \u2014several firms were designated before I participated.  MetLife was designated during the time that I was there, and I  have seen how the designation process works. I do think designation is important.  We saw during the financial crisis that some systemically important nonbanking organizations like Lehman and AIG \u2014that their distress produce d broad systemic consequences that were adverse for the U .S. economy .  And having the ability to designate firms wh en the FSOC makes the determination that their distress or failure could have systemic repercussions, I believe that \u2019s an important \u2014that \u2019s an important policy tool for FSOC to have available.  Now, it\u2019 s not meant to be a one -way street , in the sense that a firm that \u2019s designated \u2014the procedures require annual reviews.  Firms may change their business models or just how they conduct their business, and we should welcome de -designation of firms if their business model is changed in a way that leads us to believe that their failure or distress would no longer be systemically important and those are decisions that we make every year.  So, you know, I \u2019m satisfied with that process  so far.  GE Capital dramatically changed its business model  and was de- designated , and, you know, I believe it \u2019s a process that works.  So I   know that the T reasury is looking at this and may make recommendations, and if they do, I\u2019d be, you know, glad to consider them as, you know, part of the FSOC process, but I think it \u2019s been importa nt and basically working.  You asked about Equifax and, you know , of course that is a very serious data breach.  We would really urge consumers now to be very careful in monitoring their credit reports and financial situation .  And, through our supervision, we\u2019re working with the banks that we supervise to make sure that they take appropriate actions with respect to their business processes in light of the fact that there could be breaches or fraudulent transactions or information that they received that the y might use \u2014for example, in credit determinations \u2014could be contaminated by bad data .  More generally, it points to the importance of strong cybersecurity controls and attention to cybersecurity risks, which we do see as one of the most significant risks to the financial sector .  And we are very focused in our banking supervision in making sure that banks have appropriate controls in place .  And the Equifax breach, I think, highlights the importance of that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee from Bloomberg Telev ision and Radio.  We \u2019ve talked a lot today about what you \u2019re going to do and what you may do, but not necessarily about why.  With four rate increases behind you, financial conditions are looser than before you began.  And I\u2019m wondering if that bothers you, if you\u2019 re concerned about overstimulating the economy, or if you feel inflation could break out much more quickly than we have seen, or if you feel there\u2019 s a financial stability question because stocks, bonds, and real estate are all so expensive now.  How would you explain what the Fed is doing, why the F ed is doing it , to the American people?  \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: .  So , first of all , let me say that the decisions that we \u2019ve made this year about rates and today about our balance sheet are ones we\u2019 ve taken because we feel the U .S. economy is performing well.  We are working down our balance sheet because we feel that \u2019s stimulus that in some sense is no longer needed.  So the basic message here is , U.S. economic performance has been good .  The labor m arket has st rengthened subst antially.  Every measure of the labor m arket, whether it \u2019s the narrow unemployment rate, the broader unemployment rate, the number of people working in part -time jobs who want full -time work, the level of job openings, the quit  rate, the di fficulty that firms are facing in hiring workers, the level of confidence we see in surveys about the labor m arket \u2014all of that is pointing to vast and conti nuing improvement in the labor m arket . And we see sufficient strength in the economy , in terms of spending \u2014that grow th, with its ups and downs, but nevertheless is strong enough\u2014looks to be strong enough in the medium  term to support ongoing improvement in the labor m arket .  And all of that is good, and I think that the American people sho uld feel the steps we \u2019re tak ing to normalize monetary policy are ones that we feel are well justified, given the very substantial progress we \u2019ve seen in the economy. Now, inflation is running below where we want it to be, and we \u2019ve talked about that a lot during this \u2014the last hour.  This past year , where it\u2019s  not clear what the reasons are\u2014 I think it \u2019s not been mysterious in the past, but , one way or another , we have had four or five years in which inflation is running below our 2 percent objective , and we are also committed to achieving that.  So the monetary policy path that we follow and the paths that my colleagues are writing down in our projections as ones they think will be appropriate given economic conditions are ones that   we think are necessary to move inflation back up to 2 per cent and to maintain a strong labor market on a sustainable basis . And in making these judgments about the path of policy, we have to balance various risks.  One risk is that if we tighten policy too quickly, we may find out that , although we don \u2019t think this now, that the inflation shortfall is something that\u2019 s going to be persistent .  And if we tighten too quickly, we could undermine inflation performance \u2014leave it at too low a level \u2014inflation expectations could fall , and that could become ingrained, and that would be dangerous.  And so that \u2019s a reason to be cautious about raising interest rates when inflation is as low as it is.  But, on the other hand, we have a strong labor m arket and a low unemployment rate .  And al though the pace of job gains is not quite as strong this year as , for example, as it was in 2016, we \u2019re still averaging 175,000 jobs a month this year, which is quite a bit above the pace of maybe 100 to 120,000 that would be consistent with a stable unemp loyment rate if labor force participation begins to move down in the manner we expect.  So if we don\u2019 t do anything to remov e policy accommodation, and the labor m arket tightens and just continues to tighten , as you mentioned, arguably \u2014we could, you know \u2014arguably , financial conditions overall haven\u2019 t tightened that much .  We think the economy could overheat, inflation could rise more quickly and above our objective .  That\u2019s something that would occur with a  lag, and that would force us later on to tighten pol icy more rapidly than would be ideal, and we could risk a recession if we did that. So there are risks on both sides to our objectives, and most of my colleagues and I have conclu ded that a gradual path of rate increases \u2014while constantly watching incoming data, being open to revising our views on the outlook, and revising our expectations about policy \u2014is the best way to manage that set of risks. \n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 11, "dovish": 14, "neutral": 37}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 1, "dovish": 0, "neutral": 15}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 12, "dovish": 14, "neutral": 52}, "speech_summary": "At their meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the federal funds rate and begin the balance sheet normalization program in October. They expect the economy to continue growing moderately.The severe disruptions caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria will hold down economic growth in the third quarter, but growth is expected to bounce back as activity resumes and rebuilding begins. While these effects are unlikely to have a long-term impact on the national economy, recovery for the affected families and communities will take time.The labor market is showing signs of improvement with a steady participation rate, and the job market is expected to strengthen further. Inflation has decreased, but this is primarily due to unrelated factors such as one-off price reductions and hurricane-related increases in gasoline prices, which are expected to be temporary. The Committee still expects inflation to rise and stabilize around 2 percent in the next few years.The Committee is closely monitoring inflation developments due to unexpected lower inflation readings this year, and is prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed. The economic projections for growth, unemployment rate, and inflation are relatively stable, with slight adjustments compared to previous projections.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate, but expects gradual increases in the future to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation. The committee believes that the federal funds rate is currently below its neutral level, but additional rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain economic expansion.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it will begin its balance sheet normalization program in October, gradually decreasing reinvestments of proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency securities. The decline in securities holdings will be capped at $6 billion per month for Treasuries and $4 billion per month for agencies, gradually rising to maximums of $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency securities.The speaker expresses gratitude and willingness to answer any questions.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Why does the Fed want to continue raising rates when core inflation is not showing signs of heading above the Fed's goal?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has a dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. While the labor market has improved significantly, the Fed also needs to be mindful of achieving its inflation objective. Although inflation has been running below 2 percent for several years, the reasons for this shortfall have largely disappeared. The Fed anticipates that inflation will move up close to its 2 percent objective next year, but if the shortfall persists, monetary policy may need to be adjusted.", "'QUESTION': How are buoyant market conditions affecting the debate on stimulus and have they helped counter concerns about inflation shortfalls?\n'ANSWER': The Fed considers asset prices and financial conditions when assessing the economy, but it's difficult to determine the implications of asset prices on the overall outlook. Movements in asset prices could reflect changes in market participants' estimates of interest rates, which may be influenced by factors like low productivity growth and aging populations. The Fed takes into account these movements when evaluating policy.", "QUESTION: Is the balance sheet reduction plan immune to unexpected developments in the market or changes in the fiscal side?\n\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve prefers to use the federal funds rate as the active tool of policy, but if there is a significant negative shock to the economy, they may have to stop the roll-offs from the balance sheet and resume reinvestment. However, as long as they can use the federal funds rate, that is what they intend to do.", "QUESTION: If something goes wrong, does the Fed have room to respond under these conditions in the next several years, and could you describe for us what your plans are for a response, should it be warranted?\nANSWER: The Fed is not \"locked in\" to its current plans. If economic conditions change, such as faster growth, tightening labor market, or rapid inflation, the Fed will adjust its policy accordingly. The plans for the balance sheet are more rigid, but reinvestment may resume in case of a significant deterioration. The Fed is committed to achieving price stability and maximum employment.", "'QUESTION': Do you have room to respond to an economic downturn in the next few years?\n'ANSWER': Yes, if growth is stronger or inflation increases, we have room to respond. We have already raised the funds rate four times and expect further increases in the next few years. However, if there are negative shocks to the economy, we may need to use other tools like reinvestment and forward guidance.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree with Governor Brainard's statement that trend inflation has moved lower? What would the Fed need to do to boost trend inflation if it has fallen? How firm is your current expectation that the inflation slowdown will remain transitory, and what implications would that have for monetary policy if it is not?\n'ANSWER': Trend inflation has shown a modest decline in recent years due to low inflation, slack in the labor market, declines in energy prices, and a strong dollar. Inflation expectations are important for determining future inflation, and while professional forecasters' expectations remain solid, household expectations have decreased. If the factors holding inflation down are persistent rather than transitory, monetary policy would need to be altered to raise inflation back to 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': What do you think the markets might be missing in terms of the path of rate hikes compared to the FOMC's view?\n'ANSWER': The neutral interest rate has come down over the years, and FOMC participants have adjusted their views accordingly. While market participants may have lower estimates or believe in a more persistent low neutral rate, FOMC projections are based on the most likely outcome and do not account for downside risks or term premia that can affect the market-implied path.", "'QUESTION': Have you met with President Trump and what were your impressions of him and what he's looking for from the Federal Reserve?\n'ANSWER': I have not had a further meeting with President Trump since the early days of my term.

The improvement in the labor market has benefited the bottom end of the income distribution.", "'QUESTION': What is the main message of the speech and what impact has the Fed had on income distribution?\n'ANSWER': The main message of the speech is that core reforms implemented since the financial crisis have strengthened the financial system and should remain in place.

The Fed will continue its work even if down to three Governors, but a full complement of colleagues and nominations are desired.", "'QUESTION': Do you or any of the Committee members have concerns if the tax reform package does not end up being deficit neutral and adds to the debt? Would that be problematic for the economy?\n'ANSWER': That is a decision for Congress and the White House. However, it would be beneficial if the fiscal package could create incentives to raise productivity growth. We do face unsustainable debt in the long-term due to an aging population, which will require adjustments to fiscal policy. Congress should keep this in mind.", "'QUESTION': Do you think it's appropriate to take enforcement actions against Wells Fargo and what actions could you take?\n'ANSWER': I consider Wells Fargo's behavior towards its customers to be egregious and unacceptable. We are working to understand the root causes and address them. While I cannot discuss specific actions, we are committed to implementing necessary controls to ensure the organization's compliance.", "'QUESTION': Can you give me any kind of a timeline?\n'ANSWER': We are working very hard on it.", "'QUESTION': What would it take for the decision to wind down the balance sheet to be reversed and under what conditions would adding to the balance sheet be considered again? How will history judge the effectiveness of asset purchases and the conditions under which that policy should be used?\n\n'ANSWER': The effectiveness of balance sheet actions in stimulating a faster recovery and making financial conditions more accommodative has been supported by research. Future policymakers may need to resort to adding assets to a balance sheet in the event of a severe downturn. The decision to resume reinvestment would depend on a material deterioration in the economic outlook and the need to cut interest rates.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the designation process for Systemically Important Financial Institutions should be changed or improved? And does the situation with Equifax raise any systemic issues that FSOC would need to discuss?\n\n'ANSWER': Designation is important as it allows the FSOC to address the systemic repercussions of a firm's distress or failure. The process includes annual reviews and welcomes de-designation if a firm's business model changes. The Equifax breach highlights the importance of strong cybersecurity controls and attention to cybersecurity risks in the financial sector.", "'QUESTION': How would you explain what the Fed is doing, why the Fed is doing it, to the American people?\n'ANSWER': The decisions made by the Fed this year regarding rates and the balance sheet are based on the belief that the US economy is performing well. The labor market has significantly improved, and there is sufficient strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement. The Fed aims to normalize monetary policy while balancing the risks of tightening too quickly or too slowly."]}
