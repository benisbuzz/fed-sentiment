Colby Smith with the Financial Times .  I\u2019m curious what gives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated.  Interest rate \u2013sensitive sectors like housing, w hile they \u2019ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some regions , and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, I guess I would\u2014I guess I would go back to the be ginning of this tightening cycle to address that.  So as we started our rate hikes earl y last year, we said there were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence \u2014that of the speed of tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we \u2019d need to keep policy restrictive.  So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how fast to move rates up , and we moved very quickly by historical standards.  Then last December, after four consecut ive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50 \u2014of a 50 basis point hike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings.  So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to our destination.  So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold rates steady at this meeting, I would just say it \u2019s a continuation of , of that process.  The main issue that we\u2019 re focused on now is determining the extent of additional poli cy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time \u2014so that the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it \u2014we have come.   It may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace.     I want to stress one more thing \u2014and that is that the Committee decision made today was only about this meeting.  We didn\u2019 t make any decision about going forward, including what would happen at the next meeting, including\u2014we did not dec ide or really discuss anything about going to an every- other -meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach.  We really were focused on what to do at this meeting.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July\u2014any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So again, we didn\u2019 t\u2014we didn\u2019 t make a decision about July.  I mean, of course, it, it came up in the \u2014in the meeting from time to time.  But really, the focus was, was on what to do today.  I would say about, about July two things :  (1) [the] decision hasn \u2019t been made , (2) I do expect that it will be a \u201c live\u201d meeting.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  I was just wondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there\u2019 s been a level shift in the \u2014in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower progress on inflation.  And I \u2019m wondering in, in this sort of \u2014where \u2019s the disinflation coming from?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: The labor market \u2019s going to be stronger  it looks like \u2014it\u2019s not coming from the re.  Demand \u2019s not coming down all that fast.  According to GDP \u2014you\u2019ve doubled your , your estimate of GDP.  So what \u2019s the\u2014what \u2019s the narrative here?  It seems like it\u2019s getting more \u201cimmaculate ,\u201d rather than more  messy.   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So you \u2019re, you\u2019 re right that the data came in, I would say, consistent with, but on the high side of , expectations.  A nd if you go back to the old \u2014the former SEP\u2014the last SEP in March, you will see that  [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved up.  These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit.  Unemployment estimates move d down a bit .  Inflation estimates moved up a bit.   And, you know, all three of those kind of point in the same direction \u2014which is, you know, that perhaps more [mone tary policy] restraint will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting.  So although the level, frankly, is , is pretty \u2014the level of 5.6 [percent] is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the [expected] federal funds rate was trading bef ore the bank incidents of early March.  So\u2014but so we \u2019ve kind of gone back to that.  So your question is , where \u2019s the\u2014where\u2019s the disinflation going to come from?  And  I, you know, I don\u2019 t think the story has really changed.  We\u2014the C ommittee has consistentl y said and believed that the process of getting inflation down is going to be a gradual one.  It \u2019s going to take some time.  And I think you go back to the \u2014to the three -part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation \u2014which is, we think, as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward.  You start with goods.  With goods, we need to see continued healing in supply conditions \u2014supply- side conditions.  They \u2019ve definitely improved a substantial amou nt, but if you talk to people in business, they will say it \u2019s not back to where it was.  So that \u2019s, that \u2019s one thing.  And that should enable goods prices to continue \u2014goods, goods  inflation to continue to come down over time.  In terms of housing services inflation \u2014that \u2019s another big piece.  And , and you are seeing there that new rents  in new , new  leases are, are  coming in at low levels.  And it \u2019s really a matter of time as that goes through the pipeline.  In fact, I think any forecast that people are makin g right now about inflation coming down this year will , will  contain a big dose of \u2014this year and    next year \u2014will contain a , a good amount of , of disinflation [com ing] from that source.  And , and that\u2019s, again, probably going to come slower than we would [ previously have expected it to come into] effect.  That leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half , pardon me, of the\u2014of core PCE inflation that \u2019s not housing services.  And, you know, we see only the earliest signs of disinfl ation there.  It\u2019 s a sector \u2014it\u2019s a very broad and diverse sector.  I would say [that,] in a number of the parts of that sector, the largest cost would be wage cost.  I t\u2019s the service sector , so it\u2019s, it\u2019s heavily labor intensive.  And I think many analysts  would say that the key to getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions \u2014which we have seen.  We have actually seen , you know \u2014I go through a number of indicators suggesting there has been some loos ening in labor market conditions.  We need to see that continue.  I would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation down are, are coming into place .  And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below trend.  It would be a labor market that\u2019 s loosening.  It would be goods pipelines getting healthier and healthier and that kind of thing.  There, there \u2014the things are in place that we need to see, but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Nick Timiraos of  the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, what \u2019s the value in, in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now ?  I mean, not to be flippant, but I don\u2019 t lose weight just by buying a gym m embership \u2014I have to actually go to the gym.  Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year -end \u201923 rate today.  A majority of you    think you\u2019 re going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year.  So why not just rip off the Band -Aid and raise rates to day?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So the \u2014first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate question from the question\u2014from the \u2014from, from that of level.  Okay.  So \u2014and I think if you look at the SEP, that is our estimate \u2014our individual \u2014it\u2019s, it\u2019s really a  cumulation of our individual estimates of how far to go.  I , I mentioned how , how we got to those numbers .  In terms of speed, it \u2019s, it\u2019s what I said at the beginning, which is , speed was very important last year.  As we get closer and closer to t he destination\u2014and, according to the SEP, we \u2019re not so far away from the destination , in most people \u2019s accounting \u2014it\u2019s, it\u2019s reasonable\u2014it \u2019s common sense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every meeti ng.  And so the C ommittee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if only slightly . Then there are benefits to that.  So that gives us more information to make decisions.  We may try to make better decisions.  I think it allows the ec onomy a little more time to adapt as we\u2014as we make our decisions going forward , and we \u2019ll get to see, you know \u2014we haven \u2019t really \u2014we don\u2019 t know the full extent of , of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we \u2019ve seen.  We, we\u2014i t would be early to see those, but we don\u2019 t know what the extent is.  We\u2019 ll have some more time to see that unfold.  I mean, it \u2019s, it\u2019s just the idea that we \u2019re trying to get this right.  And this is \u2014if you think of the two things as separate variables , then I think \u2014I think that the skip\u2014 I shouldn\u2019 t call it a skip \u2014the , the decision makes sense.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: I know you said July is live .

You know, we \u2014since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting, it \u2019ll really be a three- month period of data that we can look at.

You obviously, in your forecasts , marked up the sort of path for growth, mark ed down the path for unemployment , and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably.  I wonder, you know , since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy\u2019 s a lot more resilient and inflation is going to be a lot m ore stubborn?  And given that, you know, why do you feel confident that this is as high as you \u2019re going to have to revise the federal funds rate?  Or do you think it \u2019s possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this , this cycle?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, I \u2014I mean, on the first part, I just think we \u2019re following the data and also the outlook.  The economy is \u2014the labor market, I think, has surprised many, if not all , analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience, really.  And it \u2019s, it\u2019s just remarkable.  And that \u2019s really, if you think about it \u2014that \u2019s what \u2019s driving it.  It \u2019s job    creation.  It \u2019s, it\u2019s wages moving up.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s supporting spending, which in turn is supporting hiring.  And it \u2019s, it\u2019s really the engine, it seems, that is \u2014that is driving the economy.  And so it\u2019s, it\u2019s really the , the data .  In terms of, you know \u2014we , we always write down at these meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s how we do it.  It \u2019s based on our , our own individual assessments of what the most likely path of the economy is.  It can be\u2014it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher.  And, you know, there \u2019s really no way to know.  But it \u2019s\u2014it is \u2014it\u2019 s, it\u2019s what people think as of today, and as the \u2014as the data come in, it , it can move around during the intermeeting period.  It could wind up back in the same place.  But it really will be data driven.  I can \u2019t\u2014I can \u2019t tell you that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the\u2014w here the federal funds rate will be that far in advance.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking my question.  You had said back at the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance.  Is that s till the case, or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there?  And also, could you give us an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate?  Is the \u2014obviously, the current rate, according to the Committee, is not sufficiently restrictive .  Is it 5.6?    Is it 6?  Where is sufficiently restrictive ?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, I, I would say again that I think that , over time, the balance of risks, as we move from very, you know \u2014from interest rates that are effectively zero now to 5 percentage points with , with an SEP calling for additional hikes \u2014I think we \u2019ve moved much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate , and I think that means by\u2014almost by def inition that the \u2014that the risks of , of sort of overdoing it and under ,    underdoing it are , are getting closer to being in balance.  I still think , and my, my colleagues agree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still.  So we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019 t think we \u2019re there with inflation yet because we \u2019re just looking at the data.  And  if you look at the \u2014at the full range of , of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just \u2014you just aren\u2019 t seeing a lot of progress over the last year.  Headline,  of course, inflation has come down materially, but , as you know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going . Sufficiently \u2014so I think, you know , what , what we \u2019d like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down.  That \u2019s, that \u2019s what we want to see\u2014of course that \u2019s what we want to see.  And I , I think it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s also\u2014we understand that there are lags, but remember th at it\u2019s, it\u2019s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening.  I think it \u2019s\u2014I think the reason we \u2019re, we\u2019re comfortable pausing is that we are still\u2014much of the tightening took place over last summer and later into the year.  And I think it \u2019s, it\u2019s reasonable to think that some of that may come into effect.  So we \u2019re, you know \u2014I think stretching out into a more moderate pace is appropriate to , to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you know, more \u2014with more data over time.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thanks for taking our questions.  I wanted to ask further on the lag effects\u2014when you\u2019 re considering when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would expect to kick in as those lag effects come , come into effect that would inform your decisions?  Have you learned things over t he past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to expect those lags to come into effect?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yeah.  So it \u2019s a\u2014it\u2019 s a challenging thing in, in economics.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable lags.  Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate hikes.  So if you\u2014if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting off\u2014by the time we had lifted off , the two -year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of where [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points.  So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where \u2014where news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire.  So that \u2019s, that \u2019s different.  But it \u2019s still the case that what you see i s interest -sensitive spending is affected very, very quickly \u2014so housing, and durable goods , and things like that .  But broader demand , and spending, and, and asset values, and things like that \u2014they just take longer. And you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on that.  So there \u2019s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it ta kes.  So, you know, then that makes it challenging, of course.  So we \u2019re, we\u2019re looking at the calendar.  We\u2019re, we\u2019re looking at what \u2019s happening in the economy.  We\u2019 re having to make these judgments.  Again, i t\u2019s one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate pace now as we seek that , that  ultimate \u2014I can \u2019t point to \u2014that ultimate endpoint.  I can \u2019t point to a specific data point.  I think we \u2019ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really flattening out reliably and then starting to soften.   I think we \u2019ll know that we \u2019re\u2014that it\u2019 s working.

And , as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation is now housing prices. And then we \u2019ve had some quirks in used- car prices.  So given that these trends are in place, I guess I \u2019m sort of asking the flip side of Nick \u2019s question :  Why signal additional rate hikes?  Aren \u2019t things headed in the direction you need?   Why not simply give it even more time?  Or \u2014it\u2019s surprising to see so much hawkishness in the dots, given what w e\u2019re seeing recently.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yeah.  So, you know, we \u2019ve\u2014remember, we \u2019ve\u2014we\u2019re two and a half years into this \u2014or two and a quarter years into this.  And forecasters, including Fed forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to tu rn down and, you know, traditional\u2014 you know, typically  forecasted that it would and been wrong. So I think if you\u2014I think if you look at the \u2014at core PC E inflation overall\u2014look at it over the last six months \u2014you\u2019 re just not seeing a lot of progress.   It\u2019s running, and it \u2019s running    at a level, you know, over 4\u00bd percent \u2014far above our , our target and not really, you know, moving down.  We want to see it moving down decisively.  That \u2019s all.  We\u2019re, you know, of course, we \u2019re going to get inflation down to 2 percent  over time.   We, we  don\u2019 t want to do\u2014we , we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course.  But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent , and we will.  And we just don\u2019 t see that yet.  So , hence, you see toda y\u2019s policy decision:   both, both to write down further rate hikes by the end of this year but also to, you know, to take \u2014to, to moderate somewhat the pace with which we \u2019re moving.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Q uick follow -up.  I mean, the last press conference you mentioned you didn\u2019 t see wages driving inflation.  And, you know, there was some research from the San Francisco Fed suggesting wages aren \u2019t necessarily a key driver.  But you\u2019 ve talked about the labor market today and the need for softening.  Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right.  So I \u2019m, I\u2019m not going to comment on any particular paper, but I, I would say that the \u2014I think the over all picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early 2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for \u2014largely for goods.  People were still at home .  They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend\u2014they spent a lot on goods. And, of course, at the same time\u2014and because of that high demand, to some extent, supply chains got all snarled up.  So prices went way up.  Inflation went way up.  So that was the, the origin , and it wasn\u2019 t really particularly about the labor market or wages.  B ut as you\u2014as you moved into\u2014through \u2019 21, into \u201922, and now in \u2019 23, I think many, many analysts believe that it will be important\u2014an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing    services sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with 2 percent  inflation.  We actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at  a quite gradual pace.  So \u2014and that \u2019s, you know, that \u2019s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a few weeks ago, which is very consistent with, with  what I , I would think.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:   Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  You said in the past that you don\u2019 t like to surprise markets.  It\u2019 s kind of been the Fed\u2019 s view markets should have an idea of what you\u2019 re going to do before you go in.  You also said a number of times that it would take a while to bring inflation down.  You reiterated that again today and that we, we\u2019d get to a point where inflation could be sticky.  So I\u2019m wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should look at your reacti on function.  What will you be reacting to \u2014time or data?  In other words, if nothing much changes \u2014if we \u2019re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of inflation levels in July or in September or November\u2014will you move because you\u2019 ve said you feel you need to?  Is it time that\u2019 s going to require additional movement , or would it be reversal in inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I , I don\u2019 t want to deal with , with  hypotheticals about different ways data might move.  And so, we, you know \u2014we of course \u2014we \u2019re not \u2014we don\u2019 t go out of our way to surprise markets or the public.  At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting the policy right.  And that \u2019s, that \u2019s wha t we\u2019re doing here , and that \u2019s what we \u2019ll do for the upcoming meetings.     I will say the July meeting will be \u201c live,\u201d and we \u2019ll just have to see.  I think you\u2019 ll, you\u2019 ll see the data,  you\u2019 ll hear Fed people talking about it , and, and markets will have to make a\u2014make a judgment.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Victoria Guida with Politico.  Could you talk about the balance sheet and how you\u2019 re thinking about it?   What , what are you looking for to judge whether we \u2019re approaching reserve scarcity?  And is Treasury issuance going to affect that?  Also, are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it\u2014 if I can talk about that and then go back to the balance sheet.  So on that \u2014of course , we\u2019ve been very focused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has.  [The] Treasury has laid out its borrowing plans publicly.  I think we all saw \u2014I saw the Secretary \u2019s comments yesterday to the    effect that [the] Treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid market disruption and that they \u2019re going to watch carefully for that.  So that \u2019s, that \u2019s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, y ou know, the , the borrowings .  At the Fed , we\u2019ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills the, the TGA.  The adjustment process is very likely to involve both a reduction in the RRP facility and also in reserves.  It\u2019s really hard to say at the \u2014at the beginning of this which will be\u2014which will be greater.  We are starting at a very high level of reserves\u2014and still elevated over RRP take -up, for that matter \u2014so we don\u2019 t think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over the course of the year.  So that \u2019s, that \u2019s\u2014that \u2019s the\u2014that \u2019s the Treasury part of the answer.  We will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we \u2019re prepared to make adjustments to make sure that , that  monetary policy transmission works.  Was there another part of your question?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Yeah \u2014are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take some pressure off banks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we , we have a number of \u2014I would say the [ON] RRP [facility ] doesn\u2019 t look like it\u2019 s, it\u2019s pulling money out of \u2014out of  the banking system.  It\u2019 s actually been shrinking here lately.  So I don\u2019 t think \u2014that \u2019s not something, something we \u2019ve thought about a lot over time .  It doesn \u2019t really look like that \u2019s, that \u2019s som ething that we would do. I think it \u2019s\u2014I think it \u2019s a tool that we have. If we want to use it, we can.  There are other tools we can \u2014we can  use to address money market issues.

Have you seen sufficient cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down?  For example, how does the recent rebound affect your forecasts , and how does it fact or into monetary policy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So certainly housing\u2014very interest sensitive , and it \u2019s the first place, really, or one of the first places , that\u2019s either helped by low rates or, or  that is held back by, by higher rates.  And we certainly saw that o ver the course of the last year.  We now see housing putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.  You know, we \u2019re watching that situation carefully.  I do think we \u2014we will see rents , rents and , and  house prices filtering into , into housing se rvices inflation.  And I , I don\u2019 t see them coming up quickly.  I, I do see them kind of \u2014kind of wandering around at a relatively low level now, and that \u2019s appropriate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Do you think you\u2019 ll have to target that with further rate increases?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, I think we , we look at everything.  We don\u2019 t just look at housing.  So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices all over the country, and they write down their forecast and \u2014including their most likely forecasts\u2014 including their rate forecast.  And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we cumulate it, and then we publish it for you. So that \u2019s how \u2014that \u2019s how they do that.  Well, I don\u2019t know that housing is , is itself going to be driving the rates picture, but it \u2019s part of it.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.  So I want to go back to comments you made about , in the past ,    about unsustainable fiscal path.  The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in 10 years.  The CBO also says that federal debt will be $52 trillion by 2033.  At what point do you talk more firmly w ith lawmakers about fiscal responsibility?  Because \u2014assuming monetary policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher -level spending.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I don\u2019 t do that.  That\u2019s really not my job.  We\u2014we  hope and expect that other policymakers will respect our independence on , on monetary policy.  And we don\u2019 t see ourselves as, as , you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy.  I will say, and many of my predecessors have said , that we \u2019re on an unsus tainable fiscal path and , and  that needs to be addressed over time.  But I think trying to get into , into that with lawmakers would be \u2014would be kind of inappropriate , given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Is there any conversation then about the F ederal Reserve financing some of that debt that we \u2019re seeing coming down the pike?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: No .

So  looking at the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly \u2014your forecast for GDP this year.  The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward.  And so should we take that as a sign that the C ommittee is more confident about the pros pects of a soft landing \u2014at least more \u2014at least as it relates to what you were expecting in , in March \n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know , I\u2014I would just say it this way.  I continue to think \u2014and this really hasn \u2019t changed\u2014that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent  without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we\u2019 ve    seen in so many past instances.  It \u2019s, it\u2019s possible .  A\u2014in a way, a strong labor market is \u2014that , that gradually cools  could, could aid that along\u2014 it could aid that along.  But I , I guess I want to come back to the , the main thing, which is , though, simply this.  We, we  see\u2014the C ommittee \u2014as you can see from the SEP, the C ommittee is completely unified in the need to get inflation down to 2 percent  and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent  over time.  That is our plan.  And, you know, we , we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the \u2014in the U .S. economy is the thing that we cannot, cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today\u2019 s workers and families and businesses but also for the future.  Getting price stability back and , and restored will benefit generations of people as long as it \u2019s sustained.  And it really is the bedrock of the economy.  And , and you should understand that that is our top priority.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Just a quick follow -up on that.  I\u2019m just a little confused because you said the C ommittee will do whatever it takes to get in flation down over time , but when I look at the  SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate is lower than where it is now.  Can you help me understand that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So, you know, if you look two and three  years out with , with  the forecast \u2014first of all, I wouldn \u2019t\u2014I wouldn\u2019 t put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they\u2019 re, they \u2019re so highly uncertain.  But what they\u2019 re showing is that as inflation comes down in the \u2014in the forecast, if you don\u2019 t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually going up, r ight?  So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point\u2014two years out, let\u2019s say \u2014should come down just to maintain real rates.  And i f\u2014and actually, you know, since we\u2019re, we\u2019re probably going to\u2014we \u2019re, we\u2019re having real rates that are going to have to be meaningfully positive and significantly .  So for us to get inflation down, t hat probably means \u2014that, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is    coming down really significantly.  And again, we \u2019re talking about a couple of years out.  I think , as, as  anyone can see, not a single person on the Committee wrote down a rate cut this year, nor do I think it is at all likely to  be appropriate , if you think about it.  Inflation has not really moved down.  It has \u2014it ha s not so far reacted much to our \u2014to our existing rate hikes.  And so we \u2019re going have to keep at it.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: I \u2019m sorry.  Thank you.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Julie Chabanas, AFP News Agency.   The May job report showed a rebound in May in the B lack workers \u2019 unemployment.  Is it consistent with the Fed \u2019s maximum -employment mandate?  Are you worried about that \u2014about this rebound?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we are, of course, worried about \u2014there are\u2014there are long -standing differences in racial and ethnic groups across , across  our labor market.  That \u2019s a factor that we don\u2019 t\u2014we can \u2019t really address with our tools.  But we do conside r that when we \u2019re thinking about what constitutes maximum employment \u2014it is, for us , a broad and inclusive goal.  And so we do watch that.  But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment, has been bouncing around right near historic lows \u2014histo ric modern lows here.  So we \u2019re still talking about , I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we\u2019 ve seen in , you know, a half -century here in the United States.  So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent i s, is higher \u2014three -tenths  higher  than it was measured to be at the last \u2014a month ago.  But , still, it\u2019 s extraordinarily low.  And so it \u2019s a very, very tight labor market.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  I want to follow up first a little bit just on the rent question on housing.  We heard Governor Waller  talk about how \u2014I\u2019ll back up.  W e haven\u2019 t    quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet.  And we did hear Governor Waller talk about how an uptick in housing might mean that there \u2019s not going to be as much relief coming or a shorter bit of relief than we thought.  Can you talk about how you\u2019 re thinking about that and how that played into today\u2019 s outcome\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I wouldn\u2019 t say\u2014that \u2019s, you know \u2014as a factual matter, t hat\u2019s correct.  We do need to see, you know , rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their increases because we want \u2014we want t he, you know, we want inflation to come down.  And rental is , is a very large part of the CPI\u2014about a third\u2014and it\u2019s about half of that for the PC E.  So it\u2019s important.  And so we \u2019re\u2014it\u2019s something that we \u2019re watching very carefully.  It\u2019s part of the overall picture.  I wouldn\u2019 t say it \u2019s the decisive part, but take a step back.  What you see is\u2014look at \u2014look at core inflation over the past six months, a  year.  You \u2019re just not seeing a lot of progress \u2014not the kind of progress we want to see.  And that , that\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s hard to avoid that.  And, you know, the C ommittee \u2014people on the C ommittee \u2014the median went up significantly, so that the median participant now thinks that core PC E inflation  on a 12 -month basis will be 3.9 percent this year.  So , once again, every year for the past three years, it \u2019s gone up over the course of the year , and that \u2019s doing that again.  So we see that , and we see that inflation forecasts are coming in low again,  and we see that \u2014that that tells us that we need to do more.  And so we\u2019re\u2014that \u2019s why you see the SEP with\u2014where it is.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages a nd, given the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think w ages might need to fall in order to get inflation back in line \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So wages will continue to increase.  So we , we,  you know \u2014what we\u2019re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that \u2019s    consistent with 2 percent  inflation over time.   And so I , I think we \u2019ve seen some progress\u2014all,  all of the major measures of wages have, have  moved down from extremely elevated\u2014 not extremely  elevated \u2014highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they\u2019 re, they \u2019re moving back down but , but quite gradually.  And , and, you know, we want to see that , that  process continue gradually.  Of course, it \u2019s great to see wage increases, particularly for peo ple at the lower end of the income spectrum.  But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent , which benefits everyone.  I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone else.

I mean, i t\u2019s, it\u2019s very\u2014labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central.  You know, it \u2019s half of our mandate.  So we spend a lot of time talking about that.  I think, you know, we \u2014there , there  are structural issues that are really not for the Fed.

Mark Hamrick with  Bankrate. Wondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk n ow that we \u2019re about three months past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank .  And also, specifically, what are the risks associated with commercial real estate as well as nonbank financials?  And could you further elevate those risks with higher still rates, possibly for longer?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I \u2019m trying to think where to start.  I\u2019ll sta rt with commercial real estate.  We \u2014of course, we \u2019re watching that situation very carefully.  There \u2019s a substantial amount of commercial real estate in the banking system.  A , a large part of it is in smaller banks.  It\u2019s well distributed \u2014to the extent it \u2019s well distributedthen , then the system could, could take losses.  We do expect that there will be losses, but they \u2019ll be\u2014the y\u2019ll be banks that have concentrations , and those banks will experience larger losses.  So we \u2019re well aware of that.  We\u2019re monitor ing it carefully.  You know, it feels like \u2014it feels like something that will be around for some time , as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you know, work its way into systemic risk. In terms of nonbank financials \u2014financial sector \u2014there \u2019s been a ton of work.  And, you know, clearly in the \u2014in the pandemic, it really was \u2014it was the nonbank financial sector w here, where issues really arose.  And, you know, there \u2019s a lot of work going on in\u2014with the Administration , in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and , and in all kinds of areas in the  nonbank financial market.  And \u2014but, you know, our jurisdiction at    the Fed is over banks \u2014actually bank holding companies and some banks.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s really our main focus .  You know, in terms of the events of March\u2014as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully monitoring that situation.  You know, our , our job generally involves worrying about a lot of things that may go wrong, and that would i nclude the banks.  It might be hard for me to identify something that we don\u2019 t worry about rather than that we do worry about.  So we \u2019re watching those things very carefully.  And as we see things unfold\u2014as we see what \u2019s happening with credit conditions and, and  also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we \u2019ll be able to take , to the extent it \u2019s appropriate , we can take, if they \u2019re macroeconomic implications, we can take that into account in our rate setting.

The median unemployment rate projection for this year and next year is higher, and inflation remains above the 2 percent goal.Inflation, excluding food and energy, rose by 4 percent, while the consumer price index increased by 4 percent and core CPI by 5.3 percent in May. Despite some moderation, inflation pressures remain high and the process of bringing it back down to 2 percent will take time.The FOMC is aware of the risks of high inflation and is committed to bringing it back to the 2 percent objective. They have raised the policy rate by 5 percentage points since last year, which has had an impact on housing and investment, but it will take time to see the full effects, especially on inflation. The economy is facing challenges from tighter credit conditions, which will likely affect economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The Committee has decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate and continue reducing securities holdings. While most participants expect further interest rate increases by the end of the year, the Committee has chosen to hold the target range steady to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining future policy firming, the Committee will consider the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags in its effects, and economic and financial developments.Participants in the FOMC wrote down their individual assessments of the federal funds rate based on their most likely scenario going forward, projecting rates of 5.6% at the end of this year, 4.6% at the end of 2024, and 3.4% at the end of 2025. These projections are not a Committee decision or plan, and adjustments will be made if the economy does not evolve as projected to achieve maximum employment and price stability.The Federal Reserve's primary focus is to fulfill its public mission through its actions. It is committed to making every effort to attain its goals of maximum employment and price stability, and expresses gratitude before inviting questions.", "question_answer_summary": ["QUESTION: What gives the Committee confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive given the elevated core inflation and the recovery in interest rate-sensitive sectors?\nANSWER: The Committee's decision to hold rates steady is a continuation of the process of moderating rate hikes as they approach their destination. The focus now is determining the extent of additional policy firming needed to return inflation to 2 percent, potentially at a more moderate pace. The decision only applies to this meeting, and no decisions were made about future meetings.", "'QUESTION': So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July\u00e2\u0080\u0094any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?\n'ANSWER': We didn't make a decision about July. It came up in the meeting, but the focus was on what to do today. Two things: (1) the decision hasn't been made, (2) I do expect that it will be a \"live\" meeting.", "'QUESTION': Where is the disinflation coming from given the level shift in the dots, stronger GDP, less impact on unemployment, and slower progress on inflation?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell acknowledges the shift in the narrative and explains that the disinflation is likely due to various factors, including global disinflationary pressures, lower inflation expectations, and the impact of technological advancements on pricing power.", "QUESTION: What is the narrative regarding the current state of the labor market and inflation?\n\nANSWER: The data suggests that the labor market is strengthening and inflation is moving in the same direction. This may require more monetary policy restraint than previously thought. The process of reducing inflation will be gradual and will depend on factors such as improved supply conditions for goods and lower housing services inflation. The key to reducing inflation in the service sector is a continuing loosening in labor market conditions.", "'QUESTION': What is the value in pausing and signaling future rate hikes instead of raising rates now?\n'ANSWER': The speed of rate hikes is separate from the level of rates. As we approach our target, it makes sense to go slower. Slowing down gives us more information to make better decisions and allows the economy more time to adapt. It also gives us time to assess the consequences of recent banking turmoil.", "'QUESTION': What incremental information will the Committee be using to inform their judgment on whether this is a skip or a longer pause?\n'ANSWER': The Committee will consider the data since the last meeting, including the June employment and CPI reports, as well as the ECI, Senior Loan Officer Survey, and bank earnings. They will also assess the evolving risk picture, the financial sector, and the overall outlook before making a decision.", "'QUESTION': What has changed to make the FOMC think the economy is more resilient and inflation will be more stubborn, and why do they feel confident that this is the highest they will have to revise the federal funds rate?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC is following the data and outlook, with the labor market surprising analysts with its resilience. Job creation, wage growth, and increased spending are driving the economy. The terminal rate is based on individual assessments and can be higher or lower, but it is data-driven and subject to change. There is no confidence in predicting the federal funds rate far in advance.", "QUESTION: Has the balance of risks changed since May and what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate?\nANSWER: The balance of risks is getting closer to being in balance as we move towards a sufficiently restrictive rate. However, the risks to inflation are still on the upside. We want to see credible evidence that inflation is topping out and beginning to come down. We are comfortable pausing and allowing more data over time to make a judgment on sufficiency.", "'QUESTION': Are there things that you would expect to kick in as lag effects come into effect that would inform your decisions on when to hike interest rates again?\n'ANSWER': Monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable lags. Financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of rate hikes. Interest-sensitive spending is affected quickly, but broader demand and asset values take longer. There is no certainty or agreement on how long it takes, so we are looking at the calendar and the economy to make judgments. We will know it's working when inflation flattens out reliably and starts to soften. Taking a little more time now will prevent going past the necessary level.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide an update on credit tightening since the bank incidents in March and how you are distinguishing it from lag effects?\n'ANSWER': It is still too early to fully assess the impact of the bank incidents. We are closely monitoring the situation and if we observe significant tightening beyond what is expected, we will take that into consideration when making rate decisions.", "'QUESTION': Why signal additional rate hikes when inflation is running above target?\n'ANSWER': We have consistently forecasted that inflation would turn down, but it has remained above target. We want to see inflation moving down decisively and reach our 2 percent target. Today's policy decision reflects a moderation in the pace of rate hikes while still aiming to bring inflation down.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain how the tight labor market is driving inflation at this point?\n'ANSWER': Inflation initially stemmed from strong demand for goods due to people staying at home and having money to spend. Supply chains were disrupted, causing prices to rise. However, analysts believe that reducing inflation, especially in nonhousing services, requires sustainable wage inflation. Wages have been gradually decreasing, which aligns with recent research findings.", "'QUESTION': How should Wall Street or others look at the Fed's reaction function in upcoming meetings? Will the Fed move based on time or data?\n'ANSWER': The Fed doesn't want to speculate on hypothetical scenarios. While they aim to avoid surprising markets, their main focus is getting the policy right. The July meeting will be \"live\" and the Fed will assess the data and market judgments to make decisions.", "'QUESTION': Could you talk about the balance sheet and how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about it? What are you looking for to judge whether we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re approaching reserve scarcity? And is Treasury issuance going to affect that? Also, are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?\n'ANSWER': The Fed will monitor market conditions as the Treasury refills the TGA, and the adjustment process will likely involve a reduction in the RRP facility and reserves. Reserves are not expected to become scarce in the near term or over the year. The Fed will continue to monitor money market conditions and make adjustments as needed for monetary policy transmission.", "'QUESTION': Are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help relieve pressure on banks?\n'ANSWER': The RRP facility has not been pulling money out of the banking system and has actually been shrinking. We haven't given much thought to lowering the RRP rate as it doesn't seem necessary at the moment. We have other tools to address money market issues, but it's unlikely we would lower the rate in the near term.", "'QUESTION': Have you seen sufficient cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down? How does the recent rebound affect your forecasts and monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': Housing is very interest sensitive and can be influenced by low or high rates. We have observed housing hitting a bottom and potentially starting to rise. We are monitoring the situation closely and expect rents and house prices to impact housing services inflation, but we don't anticipate a rapid increase. The current low level is appropriate.", "'QUESTION': Do you think you'll have to target housing with further rate increases?\n'ANSWER': We look at everything, not just housing. Participants submit their forecasts, including rate forecasts, which are then published. Housing may not be the sole driver of rate changes, but it is a factor.", "'QUESTION': At what point do you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility?\n'ANSWER': That's not my job. We hope other policymakers respect our independence on monetary policy. While we acknowledge the unsustainable fiscal path, it would be inappropriate for us to get involved in fiscal policy discussions with lawmakers.", "'QUESTION': Is there any conversation about the Federal Reserve financing the debt that is coming?\n'ANSWER': No, under no circumstances.", "'QUESTION': Does the Committee's raised GDP forecast and lowered unemployment rate indicate increased confidence in a soft landing?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell believes there is a path to bring inflation down to 2 percent without a sharp downturn or significant job losses. A strong labor market could aid in achieving this goal. The Committee is completely unified in the need to lower inflation and will do whatever it takes to reach 2 percent over time, as it is crucial for the economy's stability and the well-being of current and future generations.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain why inflation is projected to be elevated next year while the fed funds rate is lower than it is now?\n'ANSWER': The forecast shows that as inflation comes down, if interest rates are not lowered, real rates will actually increase. To maintain real rates, the nominal rate should come down in the future. Cutting rates when inflation is significantly decreasing will be appropriate, but it is unlikely to happen this year as inflation has not reacted much to existing rate hikes.", "'QUESTION': Is the rebound in Black workers' unemployment consistent with the Fed's maximum-employment mandate? Are you worried about this rebound?\n'ANSWER': We are concerned about the long-standing differences in racial and ethnic groups in the labor market, but we consider it when determining maximum employment. Although overall unemployment has increased slightly, it remains historically low, indicating a very tight labor market.", "QUESTION: Can you talk about how the increase in housing prices and rents might affect inflation and the outcome of today's decision?\n\nANSWER: We need to see rents stabilize or remain low in order to bring down inflation. Rental costs make up a significant portion of the CPI and about half of the PCE. While it's not the sole factor, the lack of progress in core inflation over the past months is concerning. Inflation forecasts are also low, indicating the need for further action.", "'QUESTION': Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and, given the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think wages might need to fall in order to get inflation back in line?\n'ANSWER': Wages will continue to increase, but at a level consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. Major measures of wages have gradually moved down from highly elevated levels, and we want to see this process continue. While wage increases are beneficial, we want to bring inflation down to benefit everyone, especially those on fixed incomes who are most affected by high inflation.", "QUESTION: Has the Committee discussed the labor market and the possibility of strikes and higher wages?\nANSWER: Wages and labor market dynamics are central topics in our discussions. However, structural issues and strikes are not within the Fed's purview. We take notice of these events but focus on achieving our inflation target of 2 percent, which is increasingly influenced by service-sector inflation and wage considerations.", "'QUESTION': What are the thoughts on systemic risk now that we're three months past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank? What are the risks associated with commercial real estate and nonbank financials? Could higher rates elevate those risks further?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is closely monitoring the situation with commercial real estate, particularly in smaller banks where there could be losses. They expect some losses, but it's not seen as an immediate systemic risk. In terms of nonbank financials, there has been work to address issues in the Treasury market and other areas, but the Fed's main focus is on banks. They are watching credit conditions and individual banks to inform their rate-setting decisions.", "'QUESTION': Can further rate increases exacerbate existing issues?\n'ANSWER': We will monitor the situation and consider any tightening of conditions. Our rate tool serves macroeconomic purposes, but we also have a responsibility for financial stability, which we will always take into account."]}
