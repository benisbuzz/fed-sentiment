whether the improvement in the unemployment rate appears sustainable", "neutral"], [" Third, the Committee chose to express the inflation threshold in terms of projected inflation between one and two

I guess I have a lot of questions but I\u2019ll just offer up two here.  Why are there different targets for QE and for the funds rate?  What does that achieve?  Secondly, what good is a target if you have to make reference to calendar dates in the statement itself, which is the thing you got away from.  You had to point out in the statement that it\u2019s not substantially different from the calendar dates we  set back in October.  Do you have to keep doing that from now on to make it clear that \u2014and then just thirdly, I guess I know I said two\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: I\u2019m going to forget.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: But then you have another paragraph after that that says it \u2019s not just target it\u2019s something else.  So, it\u2019s unclear to me what good these targets are if you have to reference a calendar date, and then you kind of say in the next paragraph it\u2019s not really targets.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, so first, the \u2014as I said \u2014the asset purchases and the rate increases have different objectives.  The asset purchases are about creating some near -term momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate t arget, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing accommodation.  Two very different objectives.  Secondly, the asset purchases are a less well-understood tool.  We have \u2014we\u2019ll be learning over time about how efficacious they are, about what costs they may carry with them in terms of unintended consequences that they might December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    8 of 34  create, and we\u2019ll be seeing how \u2014what else happens in the economy that can affect, you know, the level of unemployment, for example, that we hope to achieve.  And so, for that reason, a s I discussed in my opening remarks, we decided to make the criteria for asset purchases qualitative at this time because we have a number of different things that we need to look at as we go forward.  Rate increases, by contrast, are well understood, and we understand the relationship between those rate increases and the state of the economy.  And so we\u2019ve been able to give somewhat more quantitative, more specific guidance in that respect.  With respect to the date, in the transition today, we wanted to m ake clear that the change in guidance did not \u2014it happens to be the case that it doesn\u2019t change our mid -2015 expectation.  Going forward, we\u2019ll drop the date and rely on the conditionality, and that has, I think, a very important advantage which is that if news comes in that the economy is stronger or weaker, then financial markets and the public will be able to adjust their expectations for when policy tightening will occur without the Committee having to go through a process of changing its date in a nontr ansparent way, so I think that\u2019s beneficial.  Does that cover your \u2014okay.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, what prompted the Committee to make the decision at this particular time to specify targets?  And, by taking an unemployment rate that is quite low compar ed to currently, does that shift the balance of priorities in terms of your dual mandate, closer more in the direction of reducing unemployment rather than inflationary pressures?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: That\u2019s a very good question.  We took the change today after a good bit of discussion.  We had a very substantial discussion of the threshold approach at our last meeting.  And we felt it was ready to go, ready to put out.  We \u2014while there are different views on aspects of the threshold approach, there was a lot  of agreement that having a more explicit connection between rate policy and the state of the economy was more transparent and December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    9 of 34  more helpful to the markets and to the public than our date -based guidance, and therefore, there was a general view that, at some point at least, that we should switch to that kind of guidance.  So we do hope that it\u2019ll be more helpful and give markets more information about how we\u2019re going to respond going forward.  It is not a change in our relative balance, weights, towards inflation and unemployment \u2014by no means.  First of all, with respect to inflation, we remain completely committed to our 2 percent longer -run objective.  Moreover, we expect our forecast, as you can see from the Summary of Economic Projections; our forecasts are  that inflation will actually remain, despite this threshold of 2\u00bd, that inflation will actually remain at or below 2 percent going forward.  And so\u2014and finally, the thresholds that we have put out are entirely consistent with our long -standing views on what the rate path has to be, what the path of interest rates has to be, in order to achieve improvement in the labor market while keeping inflation close to target.  So we \u2014I think both sides of the mandate are well -served here.  There is no real change in  policy.  What it is instead is an attempt to clarify the relationship between policy and economic conditions\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Could I ask, also, given that the \u2014your economic projections are all the more important now that you\u2019ve specified these targets , is it difficult to put forward these projections now given the uncertainty over the fiscal cliff?  How sort of plastic are these?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Are you talking about the SEP projections?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Yes.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, clearly the fiscal cliff is having effects on the economy.  Even though we\u2019ve not yet even reached the point of the fiscal cliff potentially kicking in, it\u2019s already affecting business investment and hiring decisions by creating uncertainty or creating pessimism.  We saw wha t happened recently to consumer sentiment, which fell, December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    10 of 34  presumably in part because of concerns about the fiscal cliff.  So, clearly, this is a major risk factor and a major source of uncertainty about the economy going forward.  I would suspect and, althoug h the participants don\u2019t all make this explicit, but I would suspect that what they are assuming in their projections is that the fiscal cliff gets resolved in some intermediate way, whereby there is  still some fiscal drag but not as much as implied by the  entire fiscal cliff.  So I think that\u2019s probably the underlying assumption that most people took when they made their projections.  But as you \u2014you\u2019re absolutely right that there is a lot of uncertainty right now and if the fiscal cliff situation turns out to be resolved in a way very different from our expectations, I\u2019m sure you would see changes in the forecast.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Alister Bull from Reuters.  Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman.  Could you talk about whether the decision to maintain the monthly bond purchases at 85 billion a month represents a ramping up or additional easing to Fed policy, because you\u2019re now going to be adding a little bit more to the size of balance sheet?  And also, you know, you\u2019ve talked about maintaining the asset purchases unt il you see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market , and you\u2019ve said that you want to take a qualitative approach, but you\u2019ve also got this 6\u00bd percent inflation threshold out there as well.  So, could you talk about what sort of eviden ce you\u2019d see to sort of make you change the pace or slow the pace of purchases?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: The first part of your question was?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Is this an additional stimulus or are you\u2014\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: No, I think this is really a continuation of what we said in September.  You recall in September we expressed dis satisfaction with progress in the labor market.  We, at that point, we began the $40 billion per month of MBS purchases and we said that unless we saw substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market that we would December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    11 of 34  undertake additional asset purchases or other actions.  And that \u2019s what we \u2019ve done today is simply follow through on what we said we would do in September.  I don\u2019t think that we have, relative to last month, I don\u2019 t think we have significantly added to accommodation.  The reason is that, at least in my view and I think many of my colleagues\u2019, that what matters primarily is the mix of assets on the balance sheet, on the asset side of the balance sheet.  So what\u2019s imp ortant is the fact that we\u2019re acquiring Treasury securities and MBS, taking those out of the market, you know, forcing investors into other closely related assets and that\u2019s where the stimulus comes from, not so much in the size of the balance sheet per se .  So, in my judgment, the amount of stimulus is more or less the same, it\u2019s just being continued.  It\u2019s a follow -through from what we saw in September.  In terms of criteria, again, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve announced an initial amount of 85 billion a mont h of purchases.  We are prepared to vary that as new information comes in.  For example, if the economy\u2019s outlook gets noticeably stronger, we would presumably begin to ramp down the level of purchases.  But again, the problem with giving a specific number  is that there are multiple criteria o n which we make this decision.  We\u2019ll be looking at the outlook for labor market, which is very important, but we\u2019ll also be looking at other factors that may be affecting the outlook for the economy.  For example, I hope it won\u2019t happen but if the fiscal cliff occurs, as I\u2019ve said many times, I don\u2019t think the Federal Reserve has the tools to offset that event and, in that case, we obviously have to temper our expectations about what we can accomplish.  Likewise, as I said, we\u2019ll also be looking at the efficacy and costs of our program and if, you know, we find, we expect it to be efficacious but if we find that it\u2019s not working as well as we hoped or if the various costs are emerging that we ha d not anticipated then th at would also have to be taken into account as we think about it.  So, we thought it was not constructive because we ourselves don\u2019t know precisely what would define December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    12 of 34  substantial improvement .  But obviously, as long as the costs and other concerns do not em erge, we\u2019ll be looking for, you know, something that is substantial in terms of a better job market.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Cook with  Bloomberg Television.  Mr. Chairman, if I could follow up just on your last response there.  Given the fiscal cliff, is it pos sible that if the country, if the policy makers were not to agree to some sort of deficit deal by the end of this year and we were to go over the fiscal cliff, that the size of these asset purchases could indeed grow in response to that?  And more specific ally, you coined the phrase \u201cfiscal cliff ,\u201d and I wanted to get your take on whether you still feel it\u2019s the most appropriate language to describe what would happen at  the beginning of the year.  There are some Americans who may be alarmed by the language,  some economists say it\u2019s more of a slope.  Do you still feel it\u2019s appropriate given the circumstances \u2014 th e contraction, the fiscal contraction, that would come if there is no deal?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, for the first part of your question if the economy actually went off the fiscal cliff, our assessment, the CBO\u2019s assessment, outside forecasters, all think that that would have very significant adverse effects on the economy and on the unemployment rate.  And so, on the margin, we would try to do what w e could.  We would perhaps increase a bit.  But I just want to, again, be clear that we cannot offset the full impact of the fiscal cliff.  It\u2019s just too big given the tools that we have available and the limitations on our policy toolkit at this point.  O n terms of the terminology, well, and people have different preferences about what they want to call things, I think it\u2019s a sensible term because I think of the fiscal policies providing support to the economy.  If fiscal policy becomes very contractionary , the economy will, I think, go off a cliff.  I think that it\u2019s reasonable to be concerned about this.  I don\u2019t buy the idea that a short -term descent off the fiscal cliff would be not costly.  I think it would be costly and, in fact, we\u2019re already seeing costs.  Why is it that consumer confidence December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    13 of 34  dropped so sharply this week?  Why is it that small business confidence dropped so sharply?  Why is \u2014why are the markets volatile?  Why is business investment at among its weakest levels during the recovery?  I thi nk all of these things, at least to some extent, can be traced to the anticipation and the concern about the fiscal cliff and I think that, you know, we don\u2019t know exactly what would happen but I think there is certainly a risk that it could be serious and, therefore, I think it is very important.  The most helpful thing that could\u2014that, I think, Congress, the Administration could do right now is find a resolution that, on the one hand, achieves long-run fiscal sustainability , which is critical, absolutely critical for a healthy economy, but also avoids derailing the recovery which is currently in process.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman, I just\u2014I want to try to square up some numbers .  The threshold that you announced today for when rate hikes might start is 6\u00bd percent.  The Committee\u2019s assessment of the longer -run unemployment rate is 6 percent, or perhaps a bit lower, and the longer -run equilibrium fed funds rate is around 4 percent according to these projections .  It suggests that when the Fed does start raising interest rates down the road, it might have to move fairly quickly to get to some equilibrium fed funds rate.  Is that, specifically, is that the case and, more generally, can you talk about what this fra mework that you set up today says about the exit strategy that you had laid out some time ago and whether that\u2019s evolving or changing?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, it\u2019s a good question.  So first of all, we don\u2019t have a precise estimate of the long -run sustai nable unemployment rate.  The estimates that were provided in the Summary of Economic Projections today, as has been the case for a while, is 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  So, it could be well less than 6 \u00bd percent, so that gives us some time.   December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    14 of 34  My anticipation is that the removal of accommodation after the takeoff point, whe never that occurs, would be relatively gradual.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at a rapid increase.  Of course, that depends on where inflation is and other conditions.  But it\u2019s \u2014the path that we\u2019r e basing these numbers on is one that assumes, first of all, as you anticipated, assumes a n increase in the funds rate first occurring some time after unemployment goes below 6\u00bd percent, but does not necessarily assume a rapid increase after that.  And I \u2014what we said in our statement is that we would take a balanced approach.  In other words, you know, once we get to that point, we may or may not raise rates at that point.  We\u2019ll look at the situation.  But assuming that inflation remains well controlled, w hich I fully anticipate, I think that the rate of increase in rates would be moderate.   This is consistent \u2014the exit strategy that we put out is consistent with our statement today because the exit strategy was primarily about how we would normalize the balance sheet over time.  And at this time we have not made any changes in that, and we believe that some increase in the size of our balance sheet is consistent still with that general sequence that we laid out in the minutes a year and a half ago.  That be ing said, if the balance sheet grows by enough, we may have to reconsider the pace or timing of that, but I don\u2019t see any changes that would, you know, radically change the time to normalization or the time to exit. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.

And then, on the monetary policy actions today, can you give us a little bit December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    15 of 34  more color on how you set the thresholds at wha t they were?  And what the alternatives were, and how you weighed various alternative but similar policies?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Sure.

That \u2014both of these parts are very important.  I don\u2019t think that we can consider these negotiations a success unless both of them happen.   [Speaker unknown; i naudible r emark]\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  No.  I think they \u2019re equally important.  On the threshold numbers, this is based\u2014these numbers are based on substantial analysis done by staff , both here and at the Reserve Banks, trying to assess under so -called optimal policy , or in the best policy that we can come up with, what would the interest rate path look like and how would it be connected or correlated with changes in unemployment and inflation.  And when we do that analy sis, what we find is that the best interest rate path \u2014as best as we can determine it based on our models and analysis, which is obviously imperfect \u2014has rates remaining low until unemployment drops below 6\u00bd percent.  And it projects if we put in the two\u2014the  half of a percentage point above the 2 percent goal as a kind of protection against any problem with price December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    16 of 34  stability, but our projections, our actual forecast suggests that inflation will not go there.

If information comes in which says the economy is stronger or weaker than we expected, that would, in principle, require a change in the date.  But it doesn\u2019t necessarily require a change in the thresholds because that date adjustment can be made by markets just simply by looking at their own forecasts of when unemployment will cross the line and the behavior of inflation\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Scott Spoerry from CNN, sir.  When you were  appearing on 60 Minutes , one of the things that happened was that you visited your old hometown, and you talked a little bit about how the economy had affected people that you grew up with and affected the people down there.  There are a lot of just regul ar people like that who are out on the countryside wondering what really happens to them if we do go over the federal cliff.  Taxes go up, spending goes down.  Do they need to look for a recession?  Are employers going to really cut back on the employment, do you think?  What do people out there really need to worry about and prepare for when it comes to actually going over that fiscal cliff, if the folks in Washington can\u2019t get their act together?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, I come from a part of South Carol ina which has been economically challenged for quite a long time and remains so.  I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from \u2014mostly agricultural, it has a little bit of manufacturing \u2014has a very high  unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate, December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    17 of 34  and people are having a hard time there.  And I\u2019ve visited there a few times since I became Chairman.  So, part of the reason that, you know, we are engaging these policies is to try and create a stronger economy \u2014more jobs \u2014so that folks across the country, including places like the one where I grew up, you know, will have more opportunity to have better lives for themselves.  So that\u2019s  extremely important and I think it\u2019s very important that we not just loo k at the numbers.  It\u2019s easy to look at the unemployment rate and say, well it\u2019s one -tenth or two -tenths.  Every tenth  means, you know, many, many people are represented there.  So it is very important to try to keep in mind the reality of unemployment, of  foreclosure, of weak wage growth, et cetera, so we always try to do that.  And I want to\u2014it\u2019s always a delicate balance\u2014 you don\u2019t want to scare people.  And I actually believe that Congress will come up with a solution, and I certainly hope they will.  But as many analysts, not just the Fed, have pointed out, if the fiscal cliff was allowed to occur, and certainly if it were sustained for any period, it could have a very negative effect on hiring, jobs, wages, economic activity, investment .  And of course, the consequences of that will be felt by everybody but certainly by those in areas like where I grew up that are relatively weak economically, would no doubt would feel the greater brunt.  So, it\u2019s exceptionally urgent and important that the Congress and the Administration come to a sensible agreement on this issue.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Okay, sir, I had a follow -up, too.  I\u2019m not going to ask you whether we\u2019re in a bond bubble.  But obviously, the new guidance that you\u2019ve given in the FOMC statement is going to  give a lot more clues to people who own bonds about when they might start lightening up their bond portfolios and changing the composition of what they own.  Was December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    18 of 34  concerns about information about bond prices and things happening in a big hurry, in terms of  some sort of a bubble popping \u2014was that a consideration in adding this transparency?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: I wouldn\u2019t say it was an important motivation for adding transparency.  I think transparency has a lot of value.  But it is the \u2014it is a f act that this greater clarity will help markets better predict how bond yields will behave.  As we go forward in time, if the economy continues to strengthen as we hope, as the exit comes closer for the Federal Reserve, then you would expect longer -term bond yields to begin to rise.  And the more information we can provide to markets about the conditionality under which the Fed would consider removing accommodation, the better information they\u2019ll have about the likely path of  bonds and that will allow for a smoother adjustment.  So I think that\u2019s a positive aspect of this communication.  It \u2014I wouldn\u2019t say it was the major reason.  The major reason is to give the markets and the public more transparency about what\u2019s determining our policy, but that is one potential advanta ge.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, you said a moment ago that these thresholds are based on an analysis of optimal policy.  In the optimal policy path that Vice Chair Yellen laid out in her speech a few weeks ago, i t showed the first rise in interest rates occurring in early 2016 and then rates rising very slowly after that.  Is that the policy that the Fed is now following?  And secondly, if I may, you referred to a number of inflation forecasts in your introductory  remarks.  In that case, how will we ever know that the inflation threshold has been hit?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: So, the kind of optimal policy path that Vice Chairman Yellen showed is indicative of the kinds of analysis we \u2019ve done.  I mean, we \u2019ve run it for a variety of different scenarios, different assumptions about models , and so on, but the general December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    19 of 34  character of that interest rate path, i.e. , that it stays low until unemployment is in the vicinity of 6\u00bd or a little lower, and then rises relativ ely slowly, which goes back to the question that was asked earlier, that it doesn \u2019t involve a rapid removal of accommodation after that point is reached.  That is consistent with that kind of analysis, and that \u2019s the type of analysis that was not the only thing we looked at but was informative in our discussion.  You \u2019ll note also in that kind of policy path, of the type that she discussed , that inflation stays essentially at 2 or very close to 2. In terms of inflation forecast, the \u2014what the C ommittee will do on a regular basis is include in its statement its views of where inflation is likely to be a year from now.  For example, currently, we already say that, you know, we expect inflation to run at or below the Committee\u2019s objective in a long er term.  The intellectual exercise we\u2019ll be doing is asking ourselves if we maintain low rates along the lines suggested by this policy, would we ex pect inflation to cross the threshold or reach that level?  Now, it\u2019s very important that the public, the m edia, the markets find our projections credible, obviously.  And so for that reason, you know, we will be referring extensively to publicly available information such as various measures of inflation\u2014 I mentioned some in my opening remarks \u2014outside forecasts , the breakevens from inflation protected bonds, et cetera.  So, if our outlook deviates in any sense in a significant way from sort of what all these things are saying, at a minimum, it will be incumbent on me and the rest of us to explain that.  But my expectation is that our projections will be broadly consistent with public views, public information, and so I think we can manage the credibility issue.  But again, just to be clear, the projection that matters for our determination is the one that the Committee collectively comes up with.  December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    20 of 34\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Sir, you\u2019ve articulated more clearly than ever your commitment to reduce unemployment, but you\u2019ve also said that you\u2019re not actually doing anything more to achieve that goal \u2014that you still expect it to be three years away, that you\u2019re disappointed with the pace of progress, and that inflation is not the limiting factor.  What is the limiting factor?  Why is the Fed not announcing today additional measures to reduce unemployment?  What would it take for you to get that?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, we took \u2014the question was whether this was something new relative to September, I think September was the date where we did do a substantial increase in accommodation.  At that point, we announced our dissatisfac tion with the state of the labor market and the outlook for jobs and said we would take further action if the outlook didn\u2019t improve.  And what we\u2019ve done today is really just following through what we said.  So, I would say that, you know, looking at it f rom the perspective of September, that we have, in fact, taken significant additional action to provide support for the recovery and for job creation.  The reason \u2014one of the considerations though, as I\u2019ve talked about, is that, you know, given that we are now in the world of unconventional policy that has both uncertain costs and uncertain efficacy or uncertain benefits, you know, that creates a more \u2014somewhat more complicated policy decision than the old style of just changing the federal funds rate.  You know, there are concerns that I\u2019ve talked about in these briefings before that if the balance sheet gets indefinitely large that there would be potential risks in terms of financial stability, in terms of market functioning.  And the Committee takes these r isks very seriously.  And they impose a certain cost on policy that doesn\u2019t exist when you\u2019re dealing only with the federal funds rate.  And so what we\u2019re trying to do here is balance the potential benefits, in terms of lower December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    21 of 34  unemployment and inflation at target, against the reality that as the balance sheet gets bigger that there\u2019s greater costs that might be associated with that, and those have to be taken to account\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Sir, if I can just follow, so these forecasts presumably incorporat e the actions taken into account, and so given those actions, it will still be three years until you achieve your goals.  Is the message to people who are unemployed basically, \u201cWe are doing all we can? \u201d  Is this the conclusion that , given that balance of factors, this is the most we can expect?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, first of all, again, these \u2014the projections that you\u2019re looking at are based on each individual \u2014this is not a Committee collective projection.  What they are, of course, is 19 separate participants making their own projections based on their own views of optimal policy.  So, for exa mple, it includes those folks who think that we shouldn\u2019t be doing any more purchases and their forecasts are included in there as well.  So, it\u2019s not exactly an apples to apples comparison, but it is true that if we could wave a magic wand and get unemplo yment down to 5 percent tomorrow, obviously we would do that, but there are constraints in terms of the dynamics of the economy, in terms of the power of these tools, and in terms of the fact that we do need to take into account, you know, the possibility of other costs and risks that might be associated with a large expansion of our balance sheet\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: To just \u2014Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report .  So just following up on that last question, how helpful would it be to see , as part of the fiscal cliff resolution, some near-term stimulus?  The President\u2019s proposed that.  Do you think\u2014how helpful do you think that would be and, I\u2019ll ask my follow up now, whatever happened to your southern accent?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, on the second one, I\u2019d like  to think I\u2019m bilingual.  When I go home sometimes I \u2014it comes out pretty strongly, but I won\u2019 t try to do that here.  So, I December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    22 of 34  try to be careful, as you know, not to give views on specific tax and spending programs.  I think, of course , obviously those are the  province of the Administration and Congress.  The attitude I\u2019ve taken has been that , at a minimum, Congress should try to do no harm, that they should try to avoid policies that significantly slow or derail the recovery at this point.  So I think that \u2019s the critical thing along with the long -term objective of achieving a sustainable fiscal path.  Now, given that basic recommendation, you know, Congress can consider variations.  For example, if they believe that they can achieve a strong, credible future path for fiscal policy, that would give them potentially some space to do something a little bit more expansionary in the short term.  But, those are judgments I think that Congress has to make about whether they can simultaneously continue  support ive fiscal  policy in the short term while maintaining the credibility that, in fact, they will be addressing our structural deficit problems in the longer term.  And that is I think really a question for them and for their staff.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Kristina Peterso n of Dow Jones.  Looking over the past year or several years, how would you evaluate the Fed\u2019s accuracy making economic forecasts, and how does that affect the ability to make monetary policy decisions, especially as it\u2019s connected to the thresholds?\n\nCHAIR MAN BERNANKE: Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we have overestimated the pace of growth, total output growth, GDP growth, from the beginning of the recovery and we have  had therefore \u2014had to continue to scale down our estimates of output growth.  But interestingly, at the same time, we have been more accurate, not perfectly accurate by any means, but we\u2019ve been somewhat more accurate in forecasting unemployment.  And how do you reconcile those two things?  I talked about this in remarks I gave at the New  York Economic Club recently, right before Thanksgiving.  And I think the reconciliation is that what we\u2019re December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    23 of 34  learning is that, at least temporarily, the financial crisis may have reduced somewhat the underlying potential growth rate of the U.S. economy.  It  has interfered with business creation, with investment, with technological advances, and so on.  And that can account for at least part of the somewhat slower growth.  At the same time, though, what \u2014of course, what monetary policy influences is not potent ial growth, not the underlying structural growth.  That\u2019s for \u2014many other different kinds of policies affect that.  What monetary policy affects, primarily, is the state of the business cycle, the amount of excess unemployment or the extent of recession in the economy.  And there, I think we\u2019ve also perhaps underestimated a bit the recession, but we\u2019ve been much closer there.  And I think therefore that we\u2019ve been able to address that somewhat more effectively with quite accommodative policies.  That being s aid, of course, we have over time, as we have seen disappointment in growth and job creation, we have obviously, as we did in September, have added accommodation and we\u2019ve continued\u2014 we continue to reassess the outlook.  I think it\u2019s only fair to say that e conomic forecasting beyond a few quarters is very, very difficult.

So let me just reiterate it.  As we stated , in fact , in our January set of principles , the central bank cannot control unemployment in the long run.  I\u2019d add a caveat to this.  There\u2019 s a little bit of a caveat here, which is that very extended periods of unemployment can interfere with the workings of the labor market.  And so, if the Fed were not to address a large unemployment problem for a long time, it might, in fact, have some influence on the long -term unemployment rate.  But as a general rule, as a general rule, and I think this is the right baseline, the long -term unemployment rate is determined by a range of structural features of the economy and a range of economic policies and not by monetary policy.  So that being said, what our 6\u00bd percent threshold is is \u2014as I said in my opening remarks, it is not a target \u2014what it is is a guidepost in terms of when the beginning of the reduction of accommodation could begin.  It could be later than that, but at least b y that time, no earlier than that time.  So it \u2019s really more like a reaction function or a Taylor rule , if you will.

So, what it\u2019s basically doing is saying how our policy will e volve over time as the economy evolves.  It has no implication that we can affect the long -run unemployment rate, which we believe is lower than 6\u00bd percent.  We think it \u2019s somewhere between 5 and 6 according to our SEP projections.  We are a dual mandate central bank and I think that providing information on both sides is more helpful.

I\u2019m sure you have some sort of theory about what you hope changes in the economy as a result of thi s announcement.  If so, what is it?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, we think it\u2019s a better form of communication.  We think it\u2019s \u2014by using the thresholds which ties rates to economic conditions, we\u2019re more transparent about what\u2019s going to determine our policy in the future.  The date -based guidanc e, it served a purpose.  But it had the problem that whenever economic outlook changed, the Committee was faced with the question of whether we should change the date -based guidance, and we did change it a couple of times.  But that was a nontransparent pr ocess.  Nobody understood exactly why we made a particular change because we were not providing any kind of fundamental information about how our policy is linked to the underlying outlook.  And so, we, I believe, certainly, that this approach is superior.  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the best possible approach, there may be other things we can do in the future.  We\u2019re always looking to find ways to improve our communication but I do think it\u2019s more transparent and will allow the markets to respond quickly and prom ptly to changes in the outlook by adjusting when they think rate increases will begin, and therefore, it\u2019ll act, to some extent, like an automatic stabilizer.  So if the outlook worsens and that leads markets to think that the increase in rates is further out in the future, that will tend to lower longer -term rates and that would tend to be supportive of the economy.  So that has an automatic stabilizer type effect.  It  kind of  offsets adverse shocks.  So it\u2019s a better form of communication.  As I said, we discussed it quite extensively at the last meeting.  And December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    26 of 34  so\u2014and frankly, given that it\u2019s a relatively complex change, it seemed like it would be a good idea to do it at a meeting where there was a press conference.

If you look at the financial market indicators, the future federal funds rate path, it\u2019s pretty consistent with the mid -2015 da te-based guidance that we had been providing.  So I\u2019m not saying there was a major inconsistency between what the business community was expecting, the markets were expecting, and what we were expecting.  So that wasn\u2019t really the issue.  The problem is th at, looking forward, that what happens if there is a significant change either for the better, or for the worse, in the outlook ?  Under the date -based guidance , that would require the Committee to determine, you know, what the new date is and to make that change in a nontransparent way.  But under this threshold- based guidance, the markets and the business community can make that calculation on their own and adjust that \u2014their estimates of when rates will begin to increase based only on their own forecast and not have to wait for the Federal Open Market Committee to give them a date.

If the business December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    27 of 34  cycle runs out of steam and you\u2019 re still at zero percent interest rates, does the Fed no longer have a forceful response in that situation?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, the Fed will always, you know, keep\u2014 we\u2019ve innovated quite a bit in the last few years and it \u2019s always possible we could find new ways to provide support for the economy.  But it\u2019 s certainly true , I\u2019ve \u2014you know, there\u2019s no doubt that with interest rates near zero and with the balance sheet already large, that the ability to provide additional accommodation is n ot unlimited and that that\u2019s just a reality and that actually is an argument, I think, for being a little bit more aggressive now.  I mean, it\u2019s a really good objective to get the economy moving, to get some momentum that protects the economy against unant icipated shocks that might occur, and gets us off the  zero bound earlier.  So, exactly for those reasons, the kind of risks that arise when the \u2014when policy interest rates are close to zero, and the  greater difficulty in providing additional policy support, I think that\u2019s an argument for being somewhat more proactive now, when we still have the ability to do that, and to try to get the economy, you know, back to a healthy condition.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chairman. \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Hi.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Donna B orak with American Banker .  My question pertains to the Volcker Rule.  Regulators, earlier this year , seemed cautiously optimistic that they \u2019d be able to finalize a rule by the end of the year.  However, that seems a bit unlikely at this point.  And now, as you know, lawmakers are calling for a two -year implementation delay on the rule.  Given the fact that it\u2019s been such a lengthy process, can you tell us where things stand at this point?  How much closer are we to a final rule?  Have the agencies been ab le to work out their differences ?  And, if you may, a prediction on when we might actually see a rule.

It\u2019s a difficult, complex rule, as you know, and we\u2019ve had, I think I recall, 18,000 comments or  something like that.  So it\u2019s been a lot to look at.  There are a lot of concerns that arose even from, you know, foreign commenters about the effects on their bond markets, et cetera.  So there\u2019s been a lot of work to do.  There, I think there is quite a  bit of agreement, I wouldn\u2019t say a final agreement, but quite a bit of agreement on key points among the regulators, at this juncture.  And, of course, if Congress gives us some other instruction, we\u2019ll follow that, but so far, we haven\u2019t received any different instruction.

I think the President has got quite a few issues he needs to be thinking about, from fiscal cliff to many other appointments and so on.  From my own perspective, I just, I really don\u2019t have an ything to add from the last press conference.  I am very much engaged in these difficult issues that we\u2019re discussing today, and I have not been spending time thinking about my own future.  So I don\u2019t really have anything to add there.

The two questions, taking the Goldfarb rule into effect, one having to do with the CPI, there\u2019s a lot of debate now with the Boehner plan about this chained CPI.  As an econ \u2014not as a Fed Chairman but as an economist \u2014is there a log ic in going to that?  Do you think it\u2019s a move that should be done separate from the politics of it?  And again, with your economist hat, the labor market, you talked about the importance, not looking at the 6.5 percent threshold, but the broader conditions.  A big debate\u2014Steve Liesman\u2019s nemesis talks a lot about people being beamed to Mars.  In your mind, what is happening in the job market?  Are we creating jobs?  Is that why it\u2019s coming down or is it because people \u2014the degree of discouraged workers?  Wha t is your sense of how quickly it\u2019s fallen because of new employment?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: So, on the first question, the chained CPI versus the fixed -weight CPI is a technical issue.  The chained CPI is technically better, according to most economists, bec ause it allows for changes in the mix of goods and services that people actually consume more effectively.  However, whether, you know, whether that\u2019s more appropriate for, say, Social Security indexing or not, I think that\u2019s ultimately a political decisio n.  I suppose a rejoinder would be that neither the CPI nor the chained CPI may necessarily be a particularly good measure of the cost of living for Social Security recipients.

Well, you know, you can see the comparison by looking, for example, at the household survey, which gives estimates of how many people are added to the labor force, how many are added to the employed, how many people are leaving the labor force, and it\u2019s true that part of the decline in unemployment \u2014and indeed all of it in the last reading, but over the recovery, part of the decline in unemployment has come from declines in participation rates, that is, people leaving the labor force.  Some of that decline in participation appears to be due to longer -run factors, aging and changing patterns of work among women.  So those things were probably not directly related to the recession, for example.  But beyond that downward trend, there\u2019s been some additional decline in labor force participation, and in the ratio of employment to population, which presumably is linked to discouragement about the state of the labor force.  So that certainly is part of the issue.  That being said, obviously there has been a good bit of job creation.  Y ou can see that either in the household survey or in the payroll establishment survey.  So I think there\u2019s no doubt that the labor market is considerably better today than it was two years ago, there\u2019s not any question about that.  But it\u2019s also the case t hat many indicators of the labor market remain quite weak, ranging from the number of long -term unemployed to the number of people who have part -time work who would like full -time work.  Wage growth obviously is very weak, and I could go on.  So, it may be  that the labor market is even a bit weaker than the current unemployment rate suggests, but I think that it is nevertheless the case that there has been improvement since the trough a couple of years ago.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, Catherine Hol lander from National Journal .  How concerned are you that markets will have to tank in order to get lawmakers to reach a deal on the fiscal cliff, and what do you make of their recent complacency?  Is there a Wall Street \u2013Washington disconnect?  December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    31 of 34\n\nCHAIRMAN BER NANKE: Interesting question.  Well, I certainly hope that markets won\u2019t have to tank.  I don\u2019t \u2014we want to have confidence, not just in markets but in businesses and households as well, and the best way the fiscal policymakers can achieve that is by coming  to a solution as quickly as possible.  Markets have obviously already responded to some extent, up and down;  you can see from day to day how they respond to news about the negotiations.  But on the other hand, it\u2019s also true , if you look at the experience , I think the  very informative experience of the debt limit debate in August of 2011, that both confidence and markets remain pretty sanguine up to pretty close to the point where it looked like there was actually a chance the debt limit would not be raise d.  And then, of course, there was a pretty sharp shock, particularly to confidence, about the time of the, you know, of the final debates.  So it\u2019s not unusual to see markets being complacent.  Of course, there\u2019s from a market point of view, there are sor t of risks in both directions.  Obviously, things go badly, but perhaps if things go especially well, that would be good news, and maybe right now markets are sort of taking an average of those two possibilities.  But again, just to reiterate, I don\u2019t thin k any policymaker, including the Fed, should be responding to markets.  What we should be doing is making policy, you know, based on the fundamentals and doing what\u2019s best for the economy and I hope that fiscal policymakers will follow that injunction as w ell\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, Steve Beckner of Market News International.  With the federal government borrowing roughly $1 trillion a year and now with the Fed on pace to buy roughly a trillion dollars a year in bonds, are you concerned about a public , and possibly global , perception that the Fed is accommodating not just growth but accommodating federal borrowing needs, and are you concerned about what this might do to the Fed\u2019 s credibility , and the December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    32 of 34  credibility of U.S. finances in general, and t he credibility of the dollar as the world\u2019s leading currency?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, first of all, just a couple of facts.  The \u2014we\u2019re buying Treasuries and mortgage -backed securities, about half and half, roughly.  So we\u2019re buying considerably less than the Treasury is issuing and, moreover, the share of outstandi ng Treasuries that the Federal Reserve owns is not all that different from what it was before the crisis, because while our holdings have increased, so has the \u2014obviously the stock of Treasuries in public hands.   So it\u2019s not quite evident that there has be en such a radical shift there.  You know, we\u2019ve been increasing our balance sheet now for some time, and we\u2019ve been very clear that this is a temporary measure.  It\u2019s a way to provide additional accommodation to an economy which needs support.  We\u2019ve been equally clear that we will normalize the balance sheet, that we will reduce the size of our holdings and\u2014whether by letting them run off or by selling assets in the future.  So this is, again, only a temporary step.  It would be quite a different matter if  we were buying these assets and holding them indefinitely.  That would be monetization.  We\u2019re not doing that.  We are very clear about our intentions.  And I think up until now, it seems our credibility has been quite good.  There is not any sign either of current inflation or of any \u2014there\u2019s no strong evidence that there are any increases in inflation expectations for that matter, looking at financial markets, looking at surveys, looking at economic forecasts, and so on.  So, this is one of the things tha t we have to look at.  Remember, I talked earlier about the potential costs of a large balance sheet.  We want to be sure that there\u2019s no misunderstanding, that there\u2019s no effect on inflation expectations from the size of our balance sheet.  That\u2019s one of the things we have to look at, but as to this point, there just really is no evidence that people are taking it that way.  And I guess it\u2019s worth pointing out \u2014of course we\u2019ve been very focused on the United States December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    33 of 34  here, but we\u2019re not the only central bank that has increased the size of its balance sheet.  The Japanese, the Europeans, the British have all done the same, and very much more or less to the same extent in terms of the fraction of GDP, and I think the sophisticated market players and the public understand that this is part of a collective need, a need to provide additional accommodation to weak economies and not an accommodation of fiscal policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Last but not least, Greg Robb, MarketWatch.  There seems to be growing evidence that some of the MBS purchases, the impact of the MBS purchases, are that banks are holding on to some of the gains and not passing them on to the borrowers.  Is there anything you can do about that and are you concerned about that?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: .  S o the question is \u2014just to restate your question \u2014is about the spread between the mortgage rates that the public pays and the yields to mortgage -backed securities that banks may hold, and the question is, is that spread widening so that the full benefit of the reduction in MBS yields is not being passed through, that\u2019s the question.  Well, I have to make sure everybody heard it, so you could answer.  Our analysis suggests that it takes time \u2014two points.  The first point is that while we don\u2019t expect a hundred percent pass -through of MBS yields to mortgage rates, our empirical and theoretical analysis \u2014and we\u2019ve had quite a bit of work done on this issue \u2014suggests that over time, the great majority of the decline in MBS yields does get passed through to mortgage r ates.  So we do anticipate, over time, that the full benefit will, or most of the benefit will, be seen by retail customers.  And indeed, we have seen already a pretty significant decline since September in retail mortgage rates.  But one thing that\u2019s perh aps confusing this issue a little bit is that there are other things happening in the economy which are affecting those spreads.  So, for example, ther e are capacity limitations, which are allowing banks to, you know, to charge higher yields, there\u2019s extra  costs like concerns about putback risk, December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    34 of 34  for example.  There\u2019s higher g -fees.  So there\u2019s a number of things happening in the economy which will tend, all else equal, to raise that spread between mortgage rates and MBS yields, so that\u2019s unfortunate.  What we can try to do there, of course, is to try to encourage good policy, for example, on putbacks, that will reduce the perceived risk and cost to the banks of making mortgage loans.  But again, you know, I think most of those things, like g -fees, for exampl e, are not really in our control, but, again, taking all those issues as constant, it does seem to be the case that, over a period of time, not immediately, but over a period of time, most of the declines in MBS yields do find their way through to mortgage  customers and thereby strengthen the housing market. \n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 2, "dovish": 24, "neutral": 37}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 2, "dovish": 2, "neutral": 29}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 4, "dovish": 26, "neutral": 66}, "speech_summary": "The FOMC acknowledges that the economy is expanding at a moderate pace, but unemployment remains high, with millions of people unable to find full-time work or have stopped looking entirely. Inflation has remained low, and in light of these conditions, the FOMC will continue its accommodative policy.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and longer-term Treasury securities in order to maintain downward pressure on interest rates and promote economic growth. The Committee will evaluate incoming information to determine the future pace and composition of asset purchases based on improvements in the labor market and overall economic activity.The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor the effectiveness and potential drawbacks of its asset purchase program, and will modify the program if necessary. The Committee intends to be flexible in adjusting the pace of securities purchases based on economic outlook and the perceived benefits and costs of the program.The FOMC has changed its forward guidance, but this does not indicate a change in their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. They expect the unemployment threshold to not be reached before mid-2015 and project inflation to remain close to 2 percent over that period.The FOMC will not automatically reduce policy accommodation when certain thresholds are reached, but will consider various factors such as inflation, inflation expectations, and employment levels in order to determine the appropriate timing and extent of any policy changes. They will also take into account broader labor market conditions, sustainability of improvements in the unemployment rate, and indicators of inflation trends and expectations.The FOMC will continue to monitor economic and financial developments to ensure policy aligns with their dual mandate. The goals of the asset purchase program and rate guidance differ, with the former aiming to boost the economy and the latter providing information on reducing accommodation. Ending asset purchases would not indicate tighter policy, as the Committee's stance would still support growth. The Committee would only begin removing accommodation through rate increases at a later point. The decisions to modify the asset purchase program and undertake rate increases are based on different criteria. The FOMC's actions aim to support economic recovery and job creation while maintaining price stability, but it is emphasized that monetary policy alone cannot fully restore the economy; collaboration between the private and public sectors is necessary.The Federal Open Market Committee emphasizes the importance of fiscal policymakers reaching an agreement on long-term fiscal sustainability without implementing policies that could hinder the current economic recovery.

The effectiveness and potential consequences of asset purchases are still being understood, so qualitative criteria are used. Rate increases, on the other hand, are well understood, allowing for more specific guidance. The use of a date in the transition is to clarify that the change in guidance does not alter the mid-2015 expectation, and removing the date in the future allows for more flexibility in adjusting expectations based on economic conditions.", "'QUESTION': What prompted the Committee to specify targets and does this shift the balance of priorities towards reducing unemployment?\n'ANSWER': The decision to specify targets was made after extensive discussion and there was agreement that it would provide more transparency and help the markets. However, this does not change the balance of priorities towards reducing unemployment as the Committee remains committed to its 2 percent inflation objective and expects inflation to remain at or below 2 percent.

How flexible are these projections?\n'ANSWER': Are you referring to the SEP projections?", "'QUESTION': How is the fiscal cliff affecting the economy?\n'ANSWER': The fiscal cliff is already impacting business investment and hiring decisions due to the uncertainty it creates. Consumer sentiment has also fallen, likely due to concerns about the fiscal cliff. The assumption in projections is that the fiscal cliff will be resolved in an intermediate way, with some fiscal drag but not as much as the entire cliff. However, if the resolution is different from expectations, forecast changes may occur.", "'QUESTION': Could you talk about whether the decision to maintain the monthly bond purchases at 85 billion a month represents a ramping up or additional easing to Fed policy?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke did not directly answer the question.", "'QUESTION': Is this an additional stimulus or a continuation of what was said in September?\n'ANSWER': This is a continuation of what was said in September. The Federal Reserve expressed dissatisfaction with the progress in the labor market and began $40 billion per month of MBS purchases. They stated that unless there was substantial improvement in the labor market outlook, they would undertake additional asset purchases or other actions. The amount of stimulus is more or less the same, it's just being continued.", "'QUESTION': Given the fiscal cliff, is it possible that if there is no deficit deal by the end of the year, the size of asset purchases could increase? Do you still think the term \"fiscal cliff\" is appropriate?\n'ANSWER': Going off the fiscal cliff would have significant adverse effects on the economy and unemployment rate. The Fed would try to do what it can to offset the impact, but it cannot fully offset it. The term \"fiscal cliff\" is sensible because contractionary fiscal policies would cause the economy to go off a cliff. It is important to find a resolution that achieves fiscal sustainability without derailing the recovery.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain the potential speed of interest rate hikes and the evolving exit strategy?\n'ANSWER': The long-run sustainable unemployment rate is estimated to be between 5.2 to 6.0 percent, potentially lower than the 6\u00c2\u00bd percent threshold for rate hikes. The removal of accommodation would be gradual, with a moderate rate of increase in rates assuming controlled inflation. The exit strategy remains consistent with the plan to normalize the balance sheet over time.", "'QUESTION': Do you think postponing off this whole consolidation is preferable to going over the cliff?\n'ANSWER': I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping that the Congress will do the right thing on the fiscal cliff. It might avoid some short-term impact on the recovery, but it could create concerns about our longer-term fiscal situation.

Both parts are equally important for the success of these negotiations.", "QUESTION: Is it possible for the thresholds to change without a change in the date?\n\nANSWER: Yes, if new information about the economy's structure is obtained, it is possible for the thresholds to change. However, this approach allows for adjustments in the date without necessarily changing the thresholds, as markets can make their own forecasts based on unemployment and inflation behavior.", "'QUESTION': What do people need to worry about and prepare for if we go over the fiscal cliff?\n'ANSWER': Going over the fiscal cliff could have a negative effect on hiring, jobs, wages, economic activity, and investment. This would be felt by everyone, but especially by those in economically weak areas. It is urgent and important for Congress and the Administration to come to a sensible agreement.", "'QUESTION': Was the consideration of a potential bond bubble popping a motivation for adding transparency in the FOMC statement?\n'ANSWER': Transparency was not an important motivation for adding transparency, but it is a fact that greater clarity will help markets predict how bond yields will behave.

How will the Fed know when the inflation threshold has been reached?\n'ANSWER': The optimal policy path shown by Vice Chair Yellen is consistent with the analysis done by the Fed. The interest rate path stays low until unemployment is around 6\u00c2\u00bd or lower, and then rises slowly. Inflation forecasts will be based on the Committee's views and publicly available information, and any deviations will be explained. The credibility of the projections is important, but the Committee's collective projection is what matters.", "'QUESTION': What is the limiting factor for reducing unemployment and why is the Fed not announcing additional measures?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has already taken significant action to support the recovery and job creation, following through on their previous announcement.

If unemployment could be reduced to 5% immediately, it would be done, but there are constraints and risks associated with expanding the balance sheet.", "'QUESTION': How helpful would it be to see near-term stimulus as part of the fiscal cliff resolution?\n'ANSWER': Congress should try to avoid policies that slow or derail the recovery. If they can achieve a strong, credible future path for fiscal policy, they could consider more expansionary measures in the short term. However, it is ultimately up to Congress to decide on the balance between short-term support and long-term deficit problems.", "'QUESTION': How does the Fed's accuracy in making economic forecasts affect its ability to make monetary policy decisions, especially in relation to the thresholds?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has overestimated GDP growth but has been more accurate in forecasting unemployment. The financial crisis may have reduced the potential growth rate of the economy, while monetary policy primarily affects the business cycle. Economic forecasting is difficult, and the Fed adjusts its policies based on new information and changes in the outlook. Tying monetary policy to an unemployment threshold is consistent with the view that central banks cannot affect the unemployment rate in the long run.", "'QUESTION': Can the Fed's monetary policy affect the long-term unemployment rate and is tying monetary policy to an unemployment threshold consistent with the belief that central banks cannot control unemployment in the long run?\n'ANSWER': The Fed acknowledges that it cannot control the long-term unemployment rate, which is determined by structural features of the economy and economic policies. However, the unemployment threshold is not a target but a guidepost for when the reduction of accommodation could begin, providing information on how policy will evolve over time. This approach is consistent with the belief that central banks cannot control unemployment in the long run.", "'QUESTION': Can the central bank control unemployment in the long run?\n'ANSWER': The central bank cannot control unemployment in the long run, but extended periods of unemployment can interfere with the labor market. The long-term unemployment rate is determined by structural features of the economy and economic policies, not by monetary policy. The 6\u00c2\u00bd percent threshold is a guidepost for when the reduction of accommodation could begin, but it does not imply that the central bank can affect the long-run unemployment rate.", "'QUESTION': Why did the Federal Reserve tie federal funds and policy to the 6.5 percent number?\n'ANSWER': Tying rates to economic conditions is a more transparent form of communication. The previous date-based guidance was nontransparent and did not provide fundamental information about policy. This new approach allows markets to respond quickly to changes in the outlook, acting as an automatic stabilizer for the economy. The change was made earlier to benefit from the press conference.", "'QUESTION': Did the FOMC see a level of uncertainty in the business community that they hope to solve by this announcement?\n'ANSWER': The expectations of the business community and the FOMC were already well aligned, so there wasn't a major inconsistency. The issue is what happens if there is a significant change in the outlook. With the new threshold-based guidance, the markets and business community can make their own calculations and adjust their estimates of when rates will increase. This is seen as a better approach.", "'QUESTION': If the business cycle runs out of steam and the Fed is still at zero percent interest rates, does the Fed no longer have a forceful response?\n'ANSWER': The Fed will always innovate and find new ways to provide support for the economy, but it is true that with interest rates near zero and a large balance sheet, the ability to provide additional accommodation is not unlimited. This is an argument for being more proactive now to protect against unexpected shocks and get the economy moving.", "QUESTION: Can you provide an update on the current state of the economy?\nANSWER: The economy is showing signs of improvement, with moderate growth and a decline in unemployment. However, there are still challenges, such as the housing market and fiscal policy uncertainty, that need to be addressed.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide an update on the progress of the Volcker Rule and when we can expect to see a final rule?\n'ANSWER': We have made significant progress on the Volcker Rule, but it is a complex process with many concerns and comments to address. There is a considerable amount of agreement among regulators on key points, but we have not received any new instructions from Congress. Our goal is to finalize the rule in early 2013.", "'QUESTION': Would Chairman Bernanke consider staying on as Chairman of the Federal Reserve if President Obama asked him to?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke has not had any conversations with the President or his team about staying on as Chairman. He is focused on current issues and has not been thinking about his own future.", "'QUESTION': What is happening in the job market? Are we creating jobs? Is it because of discouraged workers or new employment?\n'ANSWER': The job market is improving, but the decline in the unemployment rate is not solely due to job creation. It is also influenced by the degree of discouraged workers and changes in employment. The exact reasons for the decline are complex and require further analysis.", "'QUESTION': The debate over the extent to which the unemployment rate is falling?\n'ANSWER': Ah, yes. Sorry.", "QUESTION: What is the comparison between new jobs and people leaving the labor force?\n\nANSWER: Part of the decline in unemployment is due to people leaving the labor force, which may be influenced by factors like aging and changing work patterns among women. However, there has been job creation and the labor market is better than it was two years ago, although indicators such as long-term unemployment and part-time work remain weak.", "'QUESTION': How concerned are you that markets will have to tank in order to get lawmakers to reach a deal on the fiscal cliff, and what do you make of their recent complacency?

The increase in the balance sheet is temporary and the Fed has been clear about its intentions to normalize it. There is no evidence of inflation expectations being affected by the size of the balance sheet. Other central banks have also increased their balance sheets, and it is understood that this is to support weak economies, not fiscal policy.", "'QUESTION': Is the spread between mortgage rates and yields on mortgage-backed securities widening, preventing the full benefit of the reduction in MBS yields from being passed on to borrowers?\n'ANSWER': Our analysis suggests that while there may not be a 100% pass-through of MBS yields to mortgage rates, over time, the majority of the decline in MBS yields does get passed through to mortgage rates. Other factors such as capacity limitations and increased costs are affecting the spreads, but we can encourage good policies to reduce perceived risks and costs for banks in making mortgage loans."]}
