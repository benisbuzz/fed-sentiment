And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  When it comes to the taper and , eventually, to any rate increases, I \u2019m wondering if you can walk us through what \u201c substantial further progress \u201d looks like , given the latest batch of projections  that have PCE inflation coming in a little higher than the June projection, the unemployment rate also being higher than June, as w ell as the change to GDP lower than June.  If you could help us make sense of all those things as you sort through what \u201c substantial further progress \u201d looks like, that would be great.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So the test for beginning our taper  is that we \u2019ve achieved substantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment.  And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress\u2014substantial further progress.  So that part of the test is achieved, in my view and in the view of many others.  So the question is really on the maximum -employment test.  So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that, since last December , when we articulated the test , and the readings today, in many cases mo re than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the  natural rate \u201450 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled.  So that could be substantial further progress.       Many on the Committee feel that the \u201c substantial further progress \u201d test for employment has been met.  Others feel that it\u2019 s close, but they want to see a little more progress.  There \u2019s a range of perspectives.  I guess my own view would be that the test \u2014the \u201csubstantial further progress \u201d test for employment is all but met.  And so, once we \u2019ve met those two tests, once the Committee decides that they \u2019ve met  [them]\u2014and that could come as soon as the next meeting ; that\u2019s the purpose of that language , is to put notice out that  that could come as soon as the next meeting.  The Committee will consider that test, and we \u2019ll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Chair Powell.  Thanks, Michelle.  So , looking at the SEPs , we got now basically four years of inflation above target , and policy never gets to the long- run rate.  I \u2019m wondering if you could address that from two perspectives :  one, within the new framework that the Fed adopted last year  and, second, from the perspective of the average household that \u2019s now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four years running when, for some this year, real wages h ave actually gone down.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So , as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the outyears.  And that \u2019s really , I think, a reflection of\u2014and they\u2019ve  moved up significantly for this year.  And that \u2019s, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that are being\u2014that  we\u2019re seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet.  So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year.  So that suggests that inflation \u2019s going to be higher this year , and a number \u2014I guess the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tenths.  Why\u2014th ose are very modest overshoot s.  You \u2019re looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years    and three years out.  These are very, very \u2014I don \u2019t think that households are going to, you know, notice a couple of tenths of an overshoot.  That just happens to be peopl e\u2019s forecasts.   You know, we want to foster a strong labor market, and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we \u2019re very much on track to achieve those things.  In terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework.   We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent.  We want, we\u2019 re\u2014that\u2019s really the ultimate test of whether we \u2019re getting this done under the framework.  And, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percen t.  I wouldn\u2019 t put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent in 2023 and \u201924\u2014one -tenth  in \u201924.  But you\u2019 re right, those are the numbers.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Powell\u2014thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, you mentioned ongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I \u2019m wondering what the contours of that debate have been.  For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increa se?  Or is it about financial stability risks?   Or concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So let me say that there \u2019s very broad support on the Committee for this plan, both as t o the timing and as to the pace of the taper.  So this was a unanimous vote today, and I \u2019d say quite broad support for this approach.  You \u2019re correct that there  are some who would prefer to have gone sooner, and they\u2019 ve made their arguments publicly.   For some of them , it\u2019s a financial stability concern.  And for others , it\u2019s other concerns.  They can make their own arguments.  This is an approach that the Committee will broadly support, and it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate.      You know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the \u2014in the early stages of the crisis .  They were essential in restoring market function in the T reasury and other markets.  Then , as th e recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do.  And now we \u2019re in a situation where they still have a use, but it \u2019s time for us to begin to taper them.   Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning.   And, of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework \u2014the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that so rt of thing.  So we think this is the appropriate way to go.  And, again, broad support on the Committee.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Nick Timiraos  of the  Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, you have said t he test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering.  But if the near- term projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff , and not just a taper , may be closer at hand.   Does the Committee have a different opinion than you do about the threshold for liftoff that you \u2019ve articulated?   Or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper.  And the taper takes some months in everyone \u2019s figuring.  So you\u2019 re going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper.  So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it \u2019s what we adopted last September.  It \u2019s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment.  And while we have interesting signs that , in many ways , the labor market\u2019 s very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market, and we think that those imbalances will sort themself out.  Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it,    moderately higher inflation over 2 percent \u2014you know, that really depends on the path of inflation.  If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff.   So I just think, if you look at what people are writing down for year -end 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low unemployment rates .  And that \u2019s only one indicator , but it suggests a very strong labor market.  And I think they\u2019 re writing down in good faith what they see as meeting the test.   There \u2019s a range of perspectives about where the economy will be, but \u2014by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023.  So it \u2019s not really an unusually wide array of views about this.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hey, Chair Powell \u2014thank you for taking our questions.  Prior to recent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents Kaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year?   And I wonder if you thought those were appropriate .\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were do ing.  So let me just say a couple things about this subject.  We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission.  And that \u2019s why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed  officials.   So those rules are , in many respects, the same as those for government agencies , plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business.      One of thos e is\u2014sort of , three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictures.  One is , ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that \u2019s bank securities and other things.  Secondly, there are times when we \u2019re not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell financial assets.  And that \u2019s the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting.  And, third, there \u2019s regular disclosure.  So all of these \u2014everyone \u2019s, you know, ownership and activities ar e all disclosed on an annual basis.   So, you know, I would have had to go back and read people \u2019s financial disclosures to know what their activities have been.  This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess you\u2019d say it \u2019s served us well.  The o ther thing you would say\u2014that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public \u2019s trust in us.  We need to make changes, and we\u2019re going to do that as a consequence of this.  This will be a thoroughgoing and comprehensive r eview.  We\u2019 re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to follow up on Jeanna\u2019s question, the issue of ownership of these stocks and trades .  Do you think it \u2019s appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying?   Is that one of the modifications that you \u2019re looking at?  And in that these \u2014you said yourself, they\u2019 re clearly not seen as appropriate.   In that the Fed \u2019s code of conduct says Fed  officials should avoid even the appearance of the , of conflict, do those tr ades, in fact \u2014and holdings \u2014violate the Fed \u2019s code of conduct?  Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you might get\u2014 be done with your review?  Thank you, sir.   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Don \u2019t have a timeline yet ; we can start with that.  So, well, let me address the muni question, since that \u2019s in there.  You know, I personally owned municipal securities for many, many years, and in 2019, I froze that.  Meaning I \u2014they\u2019re no\u2014 I\u2019m holding all those securities, my wife and I, to maturity.  And munis were always thought  to be a pretty safe place for a Fed  person to invest because, as you know, the lore was that the Fed  would never buy municipal securities.  So it was not an uncommon thing.   And so then comes the, you know, the COVID crisis, and I reversed that policy, a nd I did it without hesitating.  And the reason was that the financial markets, including the municipal financial market, were very much on the verge of collapse.  And it was time to go, and we did.  But we also checked with the Office of Government Ethics  and\u2014who looked carefully at it and said that I didn \u2019t have a conflict.  So that \u2019s one answer that I wanted to share with you.   Secondly, you\u2019 re right, though, as \u2014we \u2019re going to be looking at all those things.  I don \u2019t want to get ahead of the process here and speculate about particular outcomes.  But this, again, comprehensive and deliberate process\u2014we \u2019re going to make changes.  I want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this c hallenge and handled the situation well, and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public \u2019s interest and the institution that we \u2019re all a part of.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  I\u2019m sorry, Chair Powell \u2014I just want to follow  up.  You said I was right.  When you said \u201c right ,\u201d about that the Feds should not own\u2014Federal Reserve officials should not own the same assets they \u2019re buying?  Is that \n\nCHAIR POWELL: I think that\u2019 s a reasonable thing.  Yeah, and, of course, for the most part, we don \u2019t.  I mean, it wa s a real coincidence;  I happened to pre-own these munis.  They were bought many years ago, actually.  And so we started buying munis as part of the M unicipal    Liquidity F acility.  So it was really not a\u2014it just was an unforeseen event.  And I couldn\u2019 t sell them, so what I did was , I just held them, checked with the ethics people , and went ahead.  So, but as a general principle, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Thank you.  T hank you, Chair Powell.  Wider  question about jobs and the Fed \u2019s schedule \u2014the Fed \u2019s policy framework that you laid out here.  You and other Fed  officials have often talked ab out expecting a job market pickup in September as more children return to school, freeing up more parents to work, COVID abating.  You mentioned in the past the extra unemployment benefits expiring.  There \u2019s some real -time data suggesting that we may not be seeing much of a return of labor supply.  So do you still expect to see that in the next couple of jobs reports?   And how would a relatively weak jobs report in September affect your plans?   Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , you\u2019 re right, we have a \u2014really , I\u2019ll call it a unique situation where , by many measures , the labor market is tight.  And 11 million job openings, very widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it \u2019s quite difficult to hire people, wages moving up, and that  kind\u2014s o, quite a tight labor market.  So our view, I think \u2014widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall, including kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties, including th e expiration of unemployment \u2014extra unemployment benefits, and other things would come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we \u2019d get out of this strange world where there \u2019re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor shortage.      And so what happened was , Delta happened.  And you had this very sharp spike in Delta cases.  And I think, so that affects\u2014for example, when schools are open 60 percent of the time or when they\u2019 re always at a threat of being closed because o f Delta, the Delta variant, you know, you might want to wait .  Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have to quit it three weeks later, you\u2019 re going to wait until you \u2019re confident of that.  So some of that may not have happened.  Also , people didn\u2019 t, you know \u2014as you know, hiring and spending in these face -to-face service industries, travel and leisure, it just kind of stopped during those months.  So we \u2014so that \u2014really , the big shortfall in labor, in jobs , was largely in travel a nd leisure , and that\u2019s because of \u2014clearly because of Delta.  So that all happened.  And so what we\u2014we know thi ngs that didn\u2019 t happen. I think there \u2019s still \u2014it may just be that it\u2019 s going to take more time.  But it still seems that, inexorably, people will \u2014these are people who were largely working back in February of 2020.  They \u2019ll get back to work when it \u2019s time to do that.  It just may take a longer time.  You \u2019re right, though\u2014it didn \u2019t happen with any force in September, and a lot of that was  Delta.   In terms of the \u2014you asked also about the test for November.  I think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think\u2014and also the overall situation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting .  Or not, depending on whether we feel like that, those tests are met.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Well, just a  quick \u2014if I could just quickly follow  up, I mean, what, how much of that will depend on what kind of jobs report we get for Septembe r?  And, I mean, is it, you know, are you in a data -dependent phase here where you need to see certain numbers going ahead?  Or are we at a point where you \u2019ve accumulated enough progress that \u2014   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So it is, it\u2019 s accumulated progress.  So, you know, for me, it wouldn\u2019 t take a knockout, great, super strong employment report.  It would take a reasonably good employment report for me to feel like that test is met.  And others on the Committee \u2014many on the Committee feel that the test is already met.  Others want to see more progress.  And, you know, we \u2019ll work it out as we go.  But I would say that, in my own thinking, the test is all but met.  So I don\u2019 t personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I \u2019d like to see a good\u2014a decent employment report.  I mean, it \u2019s not, it \u2019s, again, it \u2019s not to be confused with the test for liftoff, which is so much higher.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  So I wanted to ask about the V ice C hair of Supervision position and just \u2014I was wondering if you could speak about how you view that role and the extent to which you defer to that person on regulatory policy.  And then, just sort of a related question:   As you know, Randy Quarles\u2019 s vice c hairmanship ends next month, a nd I was wondering if he \u2019s going to retain the supervisory portfolio until he \u2019s replaced in that role .\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So  Dodd- Frank created this position, V ice C hair for Supervision, and it \u2019s, there \u2019s actually a specific assignment in the Dodd -Frank language, as I \u2019m sure you know.  And, e ffectively , what it means is that the V ice C hair for S upervision is charged with settin g the regulatory agenda.  And, you know, it \u2019s a specific grant of authority.  And in the 10 years, almost , that I\u2019 ve been at the Fed , that person has really done that.  Dan Tarullo certainly did it, and Vice Chair Quarles did it as well.   And I would, I think \u2014I respect that authority.  I respect that that\u2019 s the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward, and I would accept that.      And, furthermore, you know, it \u2019s fully appropriate to look at \u2014for a new person to come in and look at the current s tate of regulation and supervision and suggest appropriate changes, and I welcome that.  In terms of Vice Chair Quarles \u2019s term, we \u2019re not currently in that situation, and I actually don\u2019 t have any updates for you on that today.  We\u2019ll keep you posted on that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the inclusive monetary policy framework.  In particular, Bloomberg surveyed economists, and we found that they predict liftoff will happen when the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.8 percent but  the B lack unemployment rate is 6.1 percent.  And I \u2019m wondering if a 6.1 percent unemployment rate for African  Americans is consistent with full employment o r whether it would need to be lower as part of your inclusive growth strategy .\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a particular unemployment rate for any particular group.  Really , we look at a broad range of \u2014a very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is.  And one of the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing.  So we will do all of that.  So I think if you look back, what were we really thinking?  So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market.   If you look at the last two or three years of , before the pandemic hit, you saw \u2014after a lot of long progress, you saw a really strong labor market.  And you saw wages at the low end moving up faster than everywhere else\u2014s omething that \u2019s great to see.

And, by the way, we also\u2014there was no reason why it couldn\u2019 t continue.  There    were no imbalances in the economy, and then along came the pandemic.  We were not \u2014there was nothing in the economy that looked like a buildup of imbalances that could cause a recession.  So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few  more years of this.  It would have been\u2014so we \u2019re all quite eager to get back to that.   We also said we wouldn \u2019t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment , in the absence of inflation.  So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that tha t really benefited  labor market participants in a broad and inclusive way.  That \u2019s, of course, not the current situation.  We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not moderately above target.  So that \u2019s, really , how we thi nk about it.

Or should that be \u2014should the gap be narrowed, if not down to zero?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, you really \u2014I mean, first of all, ideally , there wouldn\u2019 t be any gap, of course.  We would all love to see no such gap.  This is a persistent gap, and it \u2019s very hard to explain based on typical metrics.   It\u2019s just, it \u2019s quite troubling, but it really is \u2014you know, we have, you know, famously broad and blunt tools.  I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies \u2014frankly, education policies and t hat kind of thing\u2014 are better at focusing on.  I think we \u2019ve identified the part that we can do, and we \u2019ll do that part.

And what would happen to the economy, in your view, should the debt ceiling not be raised?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question.  So it\u2019s just very important that the debt ceiling be rais ed in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills when and as they come due.  That \u2019s a critically important thing.  The failure to do that is something that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and to the financia l markets.  And it \u2019s just not something that we could contemplate, that we should contemplate.  I \u2019m not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that.  I\u2019m just going to say that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn \u2019t defaul t on any of its obligations \u2014should pay them when and as due.  And that, you know, no one should assume that the F ed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure \u2014fully protect in the event of a failure  to, you know, to make sure that we do pay those debts when they\u2019 re due.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Good.  If I could follow  up, have you discussed options with members of Congress?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, I don\u2019 t generally ever talk about the conversations I have with elected offic ials or other appointed officials.  But, look, you can see that this is a major focus among those who have responsibility for it, and\u2014including elected people.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi\u2014thanks so much.  Senato r Warren sent you a letter last week urging the F ed to break up Wells Fargo, citing what she called \u201c ungovernable behavior \u201d from the bank.  I \u2019m just curious, under what circumstances would the F ed actually consider revoking a financial holding company\u2019 s license?  And if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo, in your opinion, warrant such an action?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we \u2019re, of course, very closely monitoring Wells Fargo\u2019 s efforts to fix its widespread and pervasive problems.  They represent a serious matter to u s, and the firm is required to remediate them.  And we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to meet our expectation.  We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an unprecedented asset cap that will stay in plac e until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems.  And we \u2019re not going to remove that asset cap until that \u2019s done.  So bottom line is, we\u2019ll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices or violating laws.  But I can \u2019t speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any individual  bank.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you for taking my question.  You noted earlier in the press conference that you weren \u2019t aware of the trading activity of the Boston and Dallas F ed Bank presidents.  As you know , those, all 12 regional Fed Bank presidents just went through the renomination process earlier this year.  And Governor Brainard described it as a rigorous process at the time.  So I want to know, did anybody know \u2014did anybody at the Board level know about the stock trading activity?  And , going forward, do you still have confidence in the Dallas and Boston F ed Bank presidents to do their job?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So these,  I don\u2019 t need to tell you, we file, people file these reports annually.  And I think they were just quite recently filed for 2020.  So I don\u2019 t have any reason to think people at the B oard would have known about particular trading that \u2019s going on.  They wil l see that \u2014there are people at the F ed who see th e, you know, see the trading reports when they\u2019 re, you know, when they\u2019 re annually filed.   You know, in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing, I think no one is happy, no one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised.  It\u2019 s something we take very, very seriously.  This is an important moment for the F ed, and I \u2019m determined that we will rise to the moment and handle it in ways that will stand up over time.  I\u2019m very reluctant to get ahead of the process and speculate, though, about different things.  And, you know, when we have things to announce, we \u2019ll go ahead and do that, but that \u2019s really what I have for today.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: One small follow -up.  I mean, I know that you didn \u2019t have the 2020 forms in hand, but you would have had past -year forms in hand.  And at least in the case of, like, the Dallas disclosu re forms, similar trading activity was shown in years past.   So that , in theory, could have been something that came up in the renomination process.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So that \u2019s, yeah, that \u2019s a good question.  So, you know, the five -year review that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution, their performance on the F OMC, all of those  things.  And if there were a concern \u2014a public concern or a private concern \u2014about something that someone had done, we wouldn\u2019 t wait for the five -year.  We wouldn\u2019 t wait that day if there were concerns.      You\u2019re right, though, these \u2014as I mentioned, we have had a framework for a long time, and it \u2019s similar to what other government agencies have, only it \u2019s a little stricter.  And it is that you can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt.  You can\u2019 t trade during the FOMC period and du ring the meeting \u2014the blackout period and then during the meeting.  And then you disclose all this, and we have disclosed it for years.  So all of these things have been going \u2014to the extent they \u2019ve been going on, they\u2019 ve been a matter of public record.   And, you know \u2014but, nonetheless \u2014so that \u2014you know, it was seeming to work just okay.  And now you look at it, and you see this, and you think, \u201cWe need to do better .\u201d  And we will.  But you\u2019 re right, but it has not been part of the process.   And, appropriately, I don\u2019 t think it should have been.  I mean, I wouldn\u2019 t blame the people who conduct that review.  I really think, if someone had raised concerns or if we \u2019d had concerns, then it would have been, but it wouldn \u2019t have  been part of that process.   It would have been raised instantly, rather than once every five years.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about how  the F ed would balance the two parts of its dual mandate if inflation stays elevated but we still have a labor shortage and participation remains lower than ideal .  Would you hold off on raising rates?  Or how would you think about that?   Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, let me say one thing .  You\u2019re looking for conditions consistent with maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time.  So you\u2019 re not necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time.  But more to your point , really, we actually    have a paragraph in our framework, and something like thi s has been there for a long time.  It\u2019s, I think it \u2019s paragraph six.  And you\u2019 re talking about a situation in which the two goals are not complementary ; they\u2019 re somehow in tension.  And if we judge that \u2019s effect \u2014that is the case, what it says is , we take i nto account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate.   So, we used to call that the balanced -approach paragraph because it had those words.  So it\u2019s a very difficult situation for any central bank to be \u2014pardon me \u2014to be in a situation where the two goals are in tension.  And that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of weigh the equit ies between the two.  How long will it take , and how big are the gaps , and that kind of thing.  We don\u2019 t really think we \u2019re in that \u2014we \u2019re sort of in that situation, I\u2019 d say, in a short -term way.  But we think, we do expect that this is sort of \u2014because of the COVID shock and the reopening and all that , you\u2019 re seeing this temporarily.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  So on c orporate debt, what happened with Evergrande that we \u2019ve been watching, could that be \u2014is that a preview of what could happen with the amount of corporate debt that \u2019s out there?   In the past you\u2019ve  said you\u2019 re watching the level of corporate debt.  So is, what \u2019s your level of concern right now?  And would you consider the Evergrande Group issue sort of a warning signal?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  About the United States, no.  Corporate defaults are very low in the United States right now.  Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that ended with the pandemic.  We were very concerned in the last year or so.   We were concerned in    the last year or so, and then I \u2019d say very concerned at the beginning of the pandemic that, if you\u2019ve got a highly lever aged company and your revenue stops for an uncertain period, as things happened at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of defaults.  It didn\u2019 t happen, potentially \u2014I mean, to a significant extent because of the C ARES  Act and the response that we undertook and all that.  It was a, you know, a much stronger response than we \u2019ve ever had.  And I think for whatever reason now , you have very, very low default rates now among corporate debt.   You know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has had.  And  the government has been working to get that under control.  This is part of that effort.  The government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies.  And Evergrande is dealing with those strictures, and it \u2019s something the y\u2019re managing.  In  terms of the implications for us, there isn \u2019t, there \u2019s not a lot of direct United States exposure.   The big Chinese banks are not tremendously exposed.  But, you know, you would worry that it would affect global financial conditions through confidence cha nnels and that kind of thing.

Thanks for taking my question, Chair Powell.  I was wondering if, in your discussion about the tapering that \u2014you said that officials think it\u2019 s appropriate to end around the middle of the year \u2014if there was any discussion about what happens to the balance sheet then .  I\u2019ve heard some F ed officials say that they wouldn \u2019t shrink the balance sheet.  Was that discussed?  And what \u2019s your stance on shr inking the balance sheet?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So my thinking on this has been:  L et\u2019s get through the taper decision, and then let \u2019s turn to those issues.  There are a number of related issues that \u2014you mentioned one, Greg, but , you know, and\u2014which you need to start to think about, and we \u2019ll do that.  But I want to get, we want to get through this taper decision, and then turn to those issues , rather than start, you know, thinking about them now and having the minutes discuss them and get people thinking that we are, you know, focused on those issues , because we\u2019 re really not.  And, you know, we do have the experience of what we did last time.  We \u2019ve watched other countries and what they\u2019 ve done.  So I think we \u2019ll be able to get to sensible decisions fai rly expeditiously when it \u2019s time .  But it\u2019 s just not time yet, in my thinking.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You talked a little bit about inflation expectations.  And there does seem to be something of a divide between market expectations and the views of professional economists \u2014which are pretty much in line with the FOMC    members \u2014and laypeople \u2019s expectations, at  least as reflected in the recent New York F ed survey.  How much weight do you put on laypeople \u2019s expectations?  And what do you think accounts for that divide?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So within \u2014let \u2019s just take the household surveys generally.  The New York F ed su rvey, let me talk about that specifically , and this is from the New York F ed.  It\u2019 s only an eight -year-old survey, and it does seem as though the, they\u2019 re looking three years out.  And it seems like there\u2019 s a high correlation between three -year and one -year.  For the most part, surveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near  term but not in the lo nger term.  And that \u2019s also what expectations are showing.   So there are many, many different inflation measures, of course.  And that \u2019s why we have this thing called the CIE, which is the, it\u2019 s an index of \u2014it\u2019s market -based measures, i t\u2019s professional forecasters , and it \u2019s household surveys.  And you just put them all \u2014it\u2019s not, you know, it doesn\u2019 t have a lot of grand theory about it.  You put them all in, and you measure the change.  So you should be \u2014and, also , you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of thing, so you can look at all that.  And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up.  Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in, say , 2013, which was before the really\u2014 the drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in \u2019 14 and \u2019 15\u2014around then.  So that\u2019s not a troubling thing.   But, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important.  We spend a lot of time watching them.   And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently above levels that are really consistent with o ur mandate, then, you know, we would certainly react to that.  But we don\u2019 t really see that now.   We see more of a moderate increase that is\u2014the    first part of which is welcome.  And because, you know, inflation expectations had drifted down, and it was good to see them get back up a bit.  But, again, we watch carefully.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Sorry, you caught me off guard.  Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking my question.  I really appreciate it.  Aga in, on the taper timing.  You say it \u2019s going to last to the middle of next year.  But with your concerns about the potential for upside risks  to inflation, would you think you might need to have liftoff happen before you finish the tapering?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: That \u2019s not my expectation.  Of course, we can always\u2014we haven \u2019t decided to taper yet, and we haven\u2019 t decided the  pace yet.  So, you know, i t\u2019s not my expectation that we would have to.  We can certainly speed up or slow down the taper if we \u2014if it becomes appropriate , though.  A bsolutely.  In fact, back in \u2019 13, when we tapered, we always said we weren \u2019t on a preset course.  I think this will b e a shorter period.   The economy\u2019 s much farther along than it was when we tapered in 2013.  So it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen.  It \u2019s a very gradual taper.   It will be when we agree on it.  And, but we certainly have the freedom to either speed it up or slow it down if that becomes appropriate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: But you wouldn\u2019 t expect rate liftoff to happen until you \u2019re finished with that process?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You  wouldn\u2019 t, no, because, you know, when you\u2019 re\u2014as long as you\u2019re buying assets, you \u2019re adding accommodation, and it wouldn\u2019 t make any sense to, you know, then lift  off.  I mean, what you would do is , you\u2019 d speed up the taper, I think, if that were the situation you\u2019 re in.  Not\u2014we don\u2019 t expect to be in that situation, but I do think it would be wiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper, just because the two are then working in the same direction.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  All right, thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thank you\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  I just wanted to check in with you to see if you have an update at all on the efforts from the F ed to develop a central bank digital currency .  I believe that the report was supposed to come this summer, and indications that it\u2019 s going to come this month.  But the drumbeat seems to be kind of getting louder to see where the F ed\u2019s heading on this , and just wondering if you can provide some update there .\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure, I \u2019d be glad to.  So we think it \u2019s really important that the c entral bank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public \u2019s benefit.  That \u2019s one of our jobs.  We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments, and we need to make sure that the F ed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trustworthy currency and payment system.  So there \u2019s extensive private innovation, a lot of which is taking place outside the regul atory perimeter.   And innovation is fantastic.  Our economy runs on innovation.  But where the public \u2019s money is concerned, we need to make sure that appropriate regulatory protections are in place, and today they really are not in some cases.   So with that in mind and with the creation of myriad private currencies and currency -like products, we \u2019re workin g proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC  and, if so, in what form.  We have two broad workstreams , one of which is really technology, both at the B oard and in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston \u2019s work with MIT \u2014the other of which is to identify, scope out, deal with, analyze the various public policy issues.  As you mentioned, we do intend to publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement \u2014engagement with many different groups, including elected officials , around these issues.  We    think it \u2019s our obligation to do the work, both on technology and public policy, to form a basis for making an informed decision.   The ultimate test we\u2019ll  apply when assessing a central bank digital currency and other digital innovat ions is :  Are there clear and tangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks?  We\u2019re also, as you know, investing heavily right now in building a new settlement system for instant payments in the U.S.   It\u2019ll be the first such major expansion of our co re payment system since the 1970s.  We found the case for  this quite compelling \u2014for consumers, businesses , and just ensuring that all financial institutions have access to that payment system.   So, bottom line, we haven \u2019t made a decision about the CBDC, but we will be issuing a discussion paper soon in order to form the basis of this public interaction that we \u2019ll have.

The economy is being supported by progress on vaccinations, fiscal policy actions, and strengthening economic indicators, although the rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed the recovery in certain sectors and near-term supply constraints are impacting some industries.The worldwide shortage of semiconductors has severely limited production in the motor vehicle industry. Despite lower economic growth forecasts and a slowdown in job gains, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, with strong demand for labor. However, the unemployment rate remains understated and factors related to the pandemic are weighing on employment growth. FOMC participants project further improvement in the labor market, but acknowledge that the economic downturn has disproportionately affected those least able to handle the burden.Despite progress, joblessness remains high for lower-wage workers in the service sector, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation is currently elevated due to supply bottlenecks and is expected to remain so in the coming months before eventually moderating, with the median inflation projection falling from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next year.The FOMC remains committed to using its tools to address higher inflation if necessary, while acknowledging that the economy's trajectory is still dependent on the virus and risks to the economic outlook persist. The Delta variant has caused significant setbacks, but continued progress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support a return to normal economic conditions.The FOMC discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic conditions meet the Committee's criteria, with a general view that a gradual tapering process concluding around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate. Even after the balance sheet stops expanding, the elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions.The Federal Reserve emphasizes their commitment to their public mission and assures that they will continue to support the economy until the recovery is fully achieved.

We have achieved substantial further progress in inflation, but the question remains on employment. Many on the Committee believe the test for employment has been met, while others want to see more progress. Once both tests are met, the Committee will consider tapering at the next meeting.", "'QUESTION': Can you address the inflation forecasts and the impact on households within the new framework adopted by the Fed?\n'ANSWER': Inflation forecasts have increased due to ongoing bottlenecks and shortages in the economy. This suggests higher inflation for this year and possibly into next year. However, the modest overshoots in inflation rates for the next few years are unlikely to significantly impact households. The Fed's goal is to achieve a strong labor market and inflation averaging 2 percent over time, which is consistent with the framework.", "'QUESTION': What are the main factors driving the debate on the tapering timeline?\n'ANSWER': The debate on the tapering timeline has focused on maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increase, financial stability risks, and concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases given supply constraints. However, there is broad support among the Committee for the current plan, with a unanimous vote and a target completion of the taper by the middle of next year.

Or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do?\n'ANSWER': The Committee agrees on the test for beginning the taper, which is substantial further progress toward goals.

Our current rules include restrictions on ownership, trading during FOMC meetings, and regular disclosure, but we acknowledge the need for further changes to strengthen public trust.", "'QUESTION': Is it appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to own the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying and does it violate the Fed's code of conduct?

However, during the COVID crisis, he reversed that policy to prevent the collapse of the financial markets. The Office of Government Ethics confirmed there was no conflict. Changes will be made through a comprehensive and deliberate process to protect the public's interest.", "'QUESTION': Should Federal Reserve officials own the same assets they are buying?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell agrees that it is reasonable for Federal Reserve officials not to own the same assets they are buying. While he personally owned municipal bonds before the purchase, it was an unforeseen event and he couldn't sell them. Generally, it makes sense for officials to avoid owning the assets they are buying.", "'QUESTION': Do you still expect to see a pickup in labor supply in the next couple of jobs reports, and how would a weak jobs report in September affect your plans?\n\n'ANSWER': The labor market is tight with 11 million job openings and difficulty in hiring. We expected an increase in labor supply with kids returning to school and the expiration of unemployment benefits, but the Delta variant caused a delay. It may take more time, but people will eventually return to work. A weak jobs report in September was largely due to Delta. If the economy progresses as expected, we could move ahead with our plans in November.", "'QUESTION': How much will the decision on tapering depend on the September jobs report and are you in a data-dependent phase?\n'ANSWER': The decision on tapering is based on accumulated progress, so it wouldn't require a knockout employment report. Some on the Committee already feel the test is met, while others want to see more progress. Personally, a reasonably good employment report would suffice, but it's not the same as the test for liftoff, which is much higher.", "'QUESTION': How does Chair Powell view the role of the Vice Chair of Supervision and the extent to which he defers to that person on regulatory policy? Will Randy Quarles retain the supervisory portfolio until he is replaced?\n'ANSWER': The Vice Chair for Supervision is responsible for setting the regulatory agenda, and Chair Powell respects their authority in doing so. He welcomes a new person to assess the current state of regulation and suggest changes. As for Quarles' term, there are no updates at the moment.", "QUESTION: Is a 6.1 percent unemployment rate for African Americans consistent with full employment or does it need to be lower for inclusive growth strategy?\n\nANSWER: The goal of the inclusive monetary policy framework is not to target a specific unemployment rate for any group. Maximum employment is determined by considering a broad range of metrics, including unemployment rates, participation rates, and wages for different demographic and age groups. The aim is to achieve a strong labor market with healthy dynamics for all, as seen before the pandemic. The current situation, however, involves significant slack in the economy and inflation above target.", "'QUESTION': Should there be a significant gap between Black unemployment and overall unemployment for structural reasons that are outside of the control of the Fed that other people should be doing something about? Or should that be narrowed, if not down to zero?\n'ANSWER': Ideally, there shouldn't be any gap between Black unemployment and overall unemployment. The persistent gap is troubling and hard to explain. Eliminating inequality and racial disparities is better addressed by fiscal policy, education policies, and other societal measures. The Fed will do its part, but broader policies are needed to tackle these problems.", "QUESTION: Are prioritization, changes in bank regulations, and selling defaulted/nondefaulted Treasuries still options for dealing with a debt default? What would happen to the economy if the debt ceiling is not raised?\n\nANSWER: It is crucial to raise the debt ceiling promptly to ensure the US can meet its financial obligations. Failure to do so could result in severe damage to the economy and financial markets. The United States should not default on any obligations, and it cannot be assumed that the Fed or anyone else can fully protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure to pay debts on time.", "'QUESTION': Have you discussed options with members of Congress?\n'ANSWER': I don't generally talk about my conversations with elected officials, but it's clear that addressing this issue is a major focus for those responsible, including elected people.", "'QUESTION': Under what circumstances would the Fed consider revoking a financial holding company's license and do the indiscretions at Wells Fargo warrant such an action?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is closely monitoring Wells Fargo's efforts to fix its problems and will take supervisory action if the firm fails to meet expectations. They hold the firm accountable with an asset cap until the problems are fixed and will take strong action if a firm engages in unsafe practices or violates laws.", "'QUESTION': Did anybody at the Board level know about the stock trading activity of the Boston and Dallas Fed Bank presidents, and do you still have confidence in them?\n'ANSWER': The trading reports are filed annually and it is unlikely that people at the Board would have known about specific trading. The Fed takes this situation seriously and is determined to handle it appropriately. No announcements will be made until the process is complete.", "QUESTION: Did the Federal Reserve wait for the five-year review process to address concerns about trading activity by Reserve Bank presidents?\n\nANSWER: No, if there were concerns about trading activity, they would have been raised instantly rather than waiting for the five-year review process. The review process focuses on leadership and performance, and any concerns would be addressed immediately.", "QUESTION: How would the Fed balance its dual mandate if inflation remains high but there is a labor shortage and low participation?\n\nANSWER: The Fed is not bound by specific levels of unemployment or participation rates. They consider employment shortfalls, inflation deviations, and projected time horizons for both to return to mandate-consistent levels. They weigh the equities between the two goals and consider the duration and size of the gaps. Currently, they believe the situation is temporary due to the COVID shock and reopening.", "'QUESTION': Could the situation with Evergrande be a warning signal for the amount of corporate debt in the US?\n'ANSWER': No, the United States has very low corporate defaults currently. The concern was higher during the pandemic, but the strong response and measures taken prevented a wave of defaults. The Evergrande situation is specific to China, and while it may affect global financial conditions, it does not parallel the US corporate sector.", "QUESTION: Have you had conversations with the White House about a possible reappointment and do you want to be reappointed?\nANSWER: I have nothing to share on that today. I am focused on doing my job.", "'QUESTION': Do you have any comment on that, Brian?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell declines to comment and states that he is focused on his daily responsibilities for the American people.", "'QUESTION': Was there any discussion about what happens to the balance sheet after tapering ends?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell stated that the focus is currently on the taper decision and that they will address the related issues, such as the balance sheet, after the tapering process. They want to avoid giving the impression that they are already focused on those issues and believe they can make sensible decisions when the time comes.", "'QUESTION': How much weight does the Chairman put on laypeople's inflation expectations and what accounts for the divide between market expectations and laypeople's expectations?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman considers household surveys, including the New York Fed survey, which shows that households expect higher inflation in the near term but not in the longer term. The FOMC uses various inflation measures, including market-based measures, professional forecasters, and household surveys, to gauge inflation expectations. Currently, there is a moderate increase in inflation expectations, which is welcome, but the FOMC will react if they see troubling persistent increases.", "'QUESTION': With concerns about inflation, would liftoff happen before tapering finishes?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell does not expect liftoff to happen before tapering finishes. The pace and timing of tapering have not been decided yet, but the option to speed up or slow down the taper remains. The current tapering period is expected to be shorter than in 2013 due to the economy being in a more advanced stage.", "'QUESTION': Would rate liftoff happen before the process of buying assets is finished?\n'ANSWER': No, it wouldn't make sense to lift off while still buying assets because that would add accommodation. If the situation called for it, it would be wiser to speed up the taper and have both processes working in the same direction.", "'QUESTION': (No question provided)\n'ANSWER': The reporter thanks Chair Powell for his response.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide an update on the efforts to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC)?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is evaluating whether to issue a CBDC and is working on technology and public policy aspects. A discussion paper will be published soon for public engagement. The decision will be based on assessing the benefits, costs, and risks. The Federal Reserve is also investing in a new settlement system for instant payments. No decision has been made yet.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about falling behind in the global race for digital currencies?\n'ANSWER': We need to make an informed decision and not rush into it. As the world's reserve currency, we are in a good position to analyze and decide. It will be a governmentwide decision, requiring support from the Administration and Congress. We want broad support for this important innovation."]}
