Thanks for taking our questions.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  I \u2019m wondering if you can walk us through your thinking around the decision not to go for a full percentage point increase .  We saw a ramp -up after the May CPI report came in hotter than usual a nd then, obviously, the June figure did, too.  Was there any discussion of a stronger hike at this meeting?  Yes.  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right magnitude in light of the data and in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that we\u2019ve been making.  I\u2019d say that we wouldn\u2019 t hesitate to , to make an even larger move than we did today if the Committee were to conclude that that was\u2014 that that were appropriate.  That was not the case at this meeting.  There was very broad support for the move that we made.  You mentioned the \u2014the  June meeting.  We, we  had said many times that we were prepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disapp oint.  And that\u2019s why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting , as we said we would do.     At this meeting, we continued at that more aggressive pace , as inflation has continued to disappoint , in the form of the June CPI reading.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you so much for taking our questions.  Colby Smith with t he Financial Times.  As the C ommittee considers the policy path forward, how will it weigh the expected decline in headline inflation , which might come as a result o f the drop in commodity prices, against the fact that we are likely to see some persistence in core readings, in particular?   And given that potential tension and signs of , you know, any kind of activity weakening here, how has the Committee \u2019s thinking cha nged on how far into restrictive territory rates might  need to go?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I guess I \u2019d start by saying we \u2019ve been saying we would move expeditiously to get to the range of neutral.  And I think we \u2019ve done that now .  We\u2019re at \u2014we\u2019re  at 2.25 to 2.5 [percent], and that \u2019s right in the range of what we think is neutral.  So the question is, how are we thinking about the path forward ?  So one thing that hasn\u2019 t changed is that \u2014won \u2019t change \u2014is that our focus is continuing to\u2014is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down.  That \u2019ll continue to be our overarching focus.  We also said that we expect ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate and that we \u2019ll make decisions meeting by meeting.  So what are we going to be looking at?  You know, w e\u2019ll be looking at the incoming data , as I mentioned, and that \u2019ll start with economic activity.  Are we seeing the slowdown that we \u2014the slowdown in economic act ivity\u2014that we think we need?  And there \u2019s some evidence that we are at this time.  Of course, we \u2019ll be looking at labor market    conditions.  And we \u2019ll be asking whether we see the alignment between supply and demand getting better, getting closer.   Of cour se, we\u2019 ll be looking closely at inflation.  You mentioned headline and core.  Our mandate is for headline, of course ; it\u2019s not for core.  But we look at core because core is, is  actually a better indicator of headline a nd of all inflation going forward.  So we \u2019ll be\u2014we\u2019ll be  looking at both.  And we \u2019ll be looking at them for \u2014at those both, really \u2014for what they\u2019 re saying about  the outlook rather than just simply for , for what they say.  But we \u2019ll be asking:  D o we see inflationary pressures declining?  Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down?  So, in light of all that data, the question we \u2019ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent  target.  And it \u2019s also worth noting that these rate hikes have been large, and they \u2019ve come \u2014they\u2019ve come  quickly.  And it \u2019s likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy.  So there \u2019s probably some additional tightening, significant additional tightening, in the pipeli ne.  So where are we going with this?  I think the best \u2014I think the C ommittee broadly feels that we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level.  And maybe the best data  point for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the \u2014at t he June meeting .  So I think the median [federal funds rate] for the end of this year, the median would \u2019ve been between 3\u00bc and 3\u00bd [percent] .  And , then, people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023.  So that\u2019s\u2014even though that \u2019s now six week s old, I guess, that \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s  the most recent reading.  Of course, we \u2019ll update that reading at the \u2014at the  September meeting in eight weeks.  So that \u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it.  As I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase could be appropriate, but that \u2019s not a decision we \u2019re making now.  It\u2019 s one that we \u2019ll make based    on the data we see.  And we \u2019re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting.  We think it\u2019s\u2014we think it\u2019s  time to just go to a meeting -by-meeting basis and not provide , you know, the kind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to  neutral.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, you \u2019ve said that your policy works through influencing expectations and th at policy needs to be at least moderately restrictive, which means you need financial conditions to stay tight.  Futures market pricing currently implies you will raise rates this year along the lines of your June SEP but then lower them a few months later next year.  Are these expectations consistent with the need to keep financial conditions tight in order to moderate purchasing power and bring inflation back to 2 percent \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I \u2019m go ing to start by pointing out that it \u2019s very hard to say with any confidence in normal times \u2014in normal times \u2014what the economy\u2019 s going to be doing in 6 or 12 months.  And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond\u2014response would be \u2014of course, we do that in the SEP, but , nonetheless, you\u2019 ve got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt , because there \u2019s so much uncertainty.  These are not normal times.  There \u2019s significantly more uncertainty now about t he path ahead than I think there ordinarily is, and, ordinarily , it\u2019s quite high.  So, again, I would\u2014the best data, the only data  point I have for you really is the June SEP , which I think is just the most recent thing that the C ommittee \u2019s done.  Since then, inflation has come in higher ; economic activity has come in weaker than expected.      But at the same time, I would say that \u2019s probably the best estimate of where the Committe e\u2019s thinking is still, w hich is that we would get to a moderately restrictive level by the end of this year \u2014by which I mean somewhere between 3 and 3\u00bd percent \u2014and that when the Committee sees further rate increases in 2023 , as I mentioned, we \u2019ll update tha t, of course , at the September meeting.  But that \u2019s really the best I can do on that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: You said inflation had been a little bit hotter than anticipated.  Has your view of the terminal rate changed since June?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I wouldn\u2019 t say it was\u2014I think we didn\u2019 t expect a good reading, but this one \u2014this one  was even worse than expected, I would say.  I don \u2019t talk about my own personal estimate of , of what the terminal rate would be.  I  do\u2014I will write down that in \u2014it\u2019s going to evolve.  Obviously, it has evolved over the course \u2014I think , for all participants, it has evolved over the course of the year a s we learn how persistent inflation \u2019s going to be.  And by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows.  It\u2019 ll be\u2014it\u2019ll be  a lot.  It\u2019s an eight -week intermeeting period , so I think we \u2019ll see quite a lot of data.  And we \u2019ll make our decision at that meeting based on that data.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.   You kind of alluded to this earlie r, but I wonder in the event that you see several months of very weak headline inflation numbers because oil prices are coming down so much, but core inflation continues to be strong or even picks up, I wonder how you would think about that .  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So it \u2019s hard to deal with hypotheticals , but I just would say this.  We, you know, we  would look at both, and we would ask\u2014we \u2019d be asking ourselves , are we confident that inflation is on a path down to 2 percent ?  That \u2019s really the question.  And we \u2019ll be making\u2014you know, our policy stance will be set at a level, ultimately, at which we are confident that inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent .  So you would\u2014it would depend on a lot of things.  Of course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a bett er predictor of inflation going forward .  Headline inflation tends to be volatile.  So , in ordinary times, you, you look through volatile moves in  commodities.  The problem with the current situation is that, that  if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work\u2014to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations.  The public doesn\u2019 t distinguish between core and headline inflation in their thinking.  So it \u2019s something we have to take into consideration in our policymaking even though our tools don\u2019 t really work on, on some aspects of this, which are the supply- side issues.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman.  Earlier this week, the P resident said , \u201cWe are not going to be in a recession.\u201d So I have two questions off of that.  Do you share the President \u2019s confidence in not being in a recession ?  And, second, how would or would not a recession change polic y?  Is it a bright line, sir, where , where  contraction of the economy would be a turning point in policy?  Or is  there some amount of contraction of the economy the Committee would be willing to abide in its effort to reduce inflation?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, as I \u2014as I  mentioned, we think it \u2019s necessary to have growth slow  down.  And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons , one of which is that you\u2019 re coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021.  You \u2019re also seeing tighter monetary policy.  And you should see some slowing.  We actually think we need a period of growth below potential  in order to create some slack so that \u2014so that  the supply side can catch up.  We also think that there will be, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions.  And those are things that we expect .  And we think that they \u2019re probably necessary if we were to have\u2014 to get inflation \u2014if we were to be able to get inflation back down on a  path to 2 percent  and ultimately get there.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: The question was whether you see a recession coming and how that might or might not change policy.  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we \u2019re going to be \u2014again, we \u2019re going to be focused on getting inflation back down.  And  we\u2014as I \u2019ve said on other occasions, price stability is really the bedrock of the economy.  And nothing works in the economy without price stability.  We can \u2019t have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time.  We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic , where differences between , you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at historic minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low.  We want to get back to that , but that \u2019s not happening.  That \u2019s not going to happen without , without  restoring price stability.  So that \u2019s something we see as, as  something that we simply must do.  And we think that in the \u2014we don\u2019 t see it as a tradeoff with , with  the empl oyment mandate.  We see it as a way to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Particularly in regard to expectations, it \u2019s been said th e last few months that the risks of doing too little outweighed the lists\u2014the risks of doing too much.  Does that remain the bias?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we \u2019re trying to do just the right amount, right?  We \u2019re not \u2014we\u2019re not trying to have a recession.  And we don\u2019 t think we have to.  We think that there \u2019s a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market , as I mentioned , along with \u2014in all likelihood \u2014some , some  softening in labor market conditions.  So that is \u2014that\u2019s what we \u2019re trying to achieve , and we continue to think that there \u2019s a path to that.  We know that the path has , has clearly narrowed, really based on events that are outside of our control.  And it may narrow further.  So, you know , I do think \u2014as I said ju st now \u2014that restoring price stability is just something that we have to do.  There , there  isn\u2019t an option to fail to do that because that is the thing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time.  Without restoring price stability, you won\u2019 t be able, over the me dium  and longer term, to actually have a  strong\u2014a  sustained period of very strong labor market conditions.  So, of course , we serve both sides of the dual mandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin from Axios.  To build a little  bit on what Steve was asking, do you believe the United States is currently in a recession?  Will the GDP reading tomorrow affect that judgment one way or the other?  And has your assessment of the risk of recession changed any in recent weeks?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I don\u2019t \u2014I do not think the  U.S. is currently in a recession.  And the reason is , there are just too many areas of the economy that are\u2014that are  performing, you know, too well.  And , of course, I would point to the labor market, in particular.  As I me ntioned, it\u2019s true that growth is slowing f or reasons that we understand.  Really , the growth was extraordinarily high last year, 5 \u00bd percent.  We would have expected growth to slow.  There \u2019s also more slowing going on now.  But if you look at the labor market, you \u2019ve got growth\u2014I think, payroll jobs averaging  450,000 per month.  That \u2019s a remarkably strong level for , for this state of , of affairs .  The unemployment rate at near a 50 -year low at 3.6 percent .  All of the wage measures that we track are running very strong.  So this is a very strong labor market, and it \u2019s just not consistent with \u2014you know, 2.7 million people hired in the first half of the year .  It doesn \u2019t make sense that the    economy would be in recession with , with  this kind of thing happening.  So I don\u2019 t think the U .S. economy\u2019 s in recession right now.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: GDP?

It\u2019 s just \u2014it\u2019s just that it\u2019 s very hard \u2014it\u2019s very hard  to cumulate  [to an estimate of] U.S. GDP .  It\u2019s a large economy.

I wanted to ask about the new conflict- of-interest rules that you all rolled out.  Some s enators have written asking for those rules to have more teeth and to have sort of more transparency about Fed\u2019s financial\u2014 the Fed officials\u2019 financial activity.

We think \u2014you know, we \u2019ve thought about this carefully, and we put them in place.  And we \u2019re building the infrastructure so that\u2014so that, you know, the enforcement will be tight,  that,  actually , you won\u2019 t be able to make trades unless they\u2019 re precleared.  And the amount of trades you make, they\u2019 ll have to be 45 days or more before any F OMC meeting.  It\u2019s just \u2014I think we \u2019ve really , you know, created a very strong and robust set of rules that will, you know, support public trust in the institution.

Catarina Sarai va, Bloomberg News.  I wanted to ask a little bit more about the 75 basis points versus 50 versus 25.  Can y ou talk a little bit about what , what  kind of goes into your thinking for , you know, making the decision on how much to raise rates a nd, you know, just talking about a very large amount that you alluded to?   Could that possibly be 100 basis points?  And th en, kind of along those lines, is there any sort of weakness in the economy , outside of inflation measures , that would lead you to slow your hiking pace?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I \u2019m going to \u2014I\u2019m going to  take that as a question about the next meeting and thereafter.  So, as I mentioned, we \u2019re going to be looking at all of those things :  activity, labor market, inflation.  And we \u2019re going to be thinking about our policy stance and where does it really need  to be .  And I also mentioned that , as this process \u2014now that we \u2019re at neutral \u2014as the process goes on, at some point, it will be appropriate to, to  slow down.  And we haven\u2019 t made a decision when that point is, but intuitively that makes sense, right?  We \u2019ve been front -end-loading these very large rate increases, and now we \u2019re getting closer to where we need to be.  So that \u2019s how we \u2019re thinking about it.  And i n terms of September, we \u2019re going\u2014we\u2019re going to watch the data and the evolving outlook very caref ully and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to do.  And I \u2019m not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be.  So, you know, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase .  But that\u2019 s not a decision that we \u2019ve made at all.  So we are\u2014you know, we \u2019re going to be guided by the data.  And I think you can still think of the , the destination as broadly in line with the  September \u2014sorry, the  June SEP , because    it\u2019s only six weeks old.  And sometimes , sometimes  SEPs can get old really quick.  I think in this one\u2014this one I would say is probably, probably the best guide we have as to where the Committee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year.  So I would point you to that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  I wanted to ask about right now , there \u2019s a sort of growing gap between the F ed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, the PCE , PCE index, a nd the one that \u2019s followed by the public, the CPI, of course.  How do you expect to handle  this divergence if the PCE starts to come down enough for you to consi der slowing rate hikes, even if the public is still seeing much higher CPI ratings?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So it \u2019s an interesting, interesting situation.  Of course, we\u2019 ve, we\u2019ve  long used PCE because we think it \u2019s just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face in their lives.  And I think that  that view is pretty widely understood.  That said, the public really reads about CPI.  And the difference really is because the CPI has higher weights on things like food, gasoline, motor vehic les, and housing than the PCE index does.  And so that accounts for a lot of the difference.  However, over time, they tend to come together.  You know, we \u2014given the importance in the public eye of CPI, we are calling it out and noticing it and everything like that.  But remember, we do target PCE.  That is because we think it\u2019s a better measure.  They will come together eventually.  The typical gap was really about 25 basis points for a very long time.  And if it went \u2014if it got to 40 basis points, that would be very noticeable.  And now it \u2019s\u2014now it\u2019s  much larger than that because of the things I    mentioned.  So we \u2019ll be watching both, but , again, the one that we think is the best measure always has been PCE , at least since I think we \u2014some 20 plus years ago\u2014 moved to PCE.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: I \u2019d like to weave a couple of things together, Mr. Chairman.  Michael McK ee from Bloomberg TV and Radio.  You said that the destination pretty much remains the same in terms of your end -of-the-year target.  But where are you in the journey?  We\u2019ve now seen the federal stimulus programs end.  You mentioned consumer spending, business investment have slowed.  Are they moving at a pace you would expect?  Or is demand still greater than supply \u2014too much greater than supply that you need to do significantly more?  And I ask be cause there are lags in the impact of monetary policy, as y ou mentioned.  And a lot of this might hit in 2023.  The strong dollar effect may hit in 2023, when the economy might be weak.  How, how  do you know where you are and where you think you need to get to?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, just talking about demand for a  second :   As I mentioned in my remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter \u2014consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that.  I think, you know, people widely looked at the first -quarter numbers and thought they didn \u2019t make sense and might have been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy\u2014[that was] not , not true of the second quarter.  But at the same time, you have this labor market.  So there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak and the labor market as strong.  And the economy has gone right through that and been fine.  So that \u2014that \u2019s happened many times.  And it used to happen\u2014 if you remember, in the first quarter of every year, for several y ears in a row, GDP was negative, and the labor market was moving on just    fine.  And it turned out to just be measurement error.  It was called residual seasonality.  We don\u2019t know the situation.  The truth is, though, we , we think that demand is moderating.  We do.  How much is it moderating?  We\u2019 re not sure.  We\u2019re going to have to watch the data carefully.  There are \u2014there is a great deal of money on people \u2019s balance sheets that they can spend.  The unemployment rate is ver y low.  The labor market \u2019s very hot.  There are many, many job openings.  Wages are high.  So it\u2019s the kind of thing where you think that the \u2014that the  economy should actually be , be doing pretty well in the second half of the year.  But we \u2019ll have to see.  We don\u2019 t know that because you do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that does \u2014that is fairly broad.  So we \u2019ll be watching that .  We\u2019ll be watching that.  Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to come down.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, thank you, Chairman.  Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business.  When does the C ommittee expect to see a meaningful slowdown in the labor market?  An d how much weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before it pauses or begins to think about cutting rates?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I think you \u2019re already seeing \u2014you\u2019 ve seen , in the labor market, what you\u2019 ve seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year to modestly slower job creation \u2014still, still quite robust, as I mentioned.  So you\u2019 re seeing that.  You\u2019re seeing some increase\u2014some increase in initial claims from insurance, al though that may actually have to do with seasonal adjustments.  We\u2019re not sure that that \u2019s actually real.     There \u2019s some evidence that wages\u2014 if you look at average hour ly earnings, they appear to be moderating, not so yet from the other wage measures.  And we \u2019ll be getting the employment compensation index measurement , I think, on Friday, I guess.  And that \u2019s a very important one because it adjusts for compensation\u2014composition.  So I\u2019d say you\u2014and also, anecdotally, you hear much\u2014the sort of level of concern  on the part of businesses that they simply can \u2019t find workers is probably down a little bit from what it was, say, for example, late in the latter parts of last year.  So there \u2019s a feeling that the labor market is moving back into balance.  If you look at \u2014if you look at  job openings or quits, you see them moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down.  But it\u2019 s only the beginning of an adjustment.   But I think most \u2014also, if you look at \u2014I mean, once you start citing these things, you can\u2019t stop.  If you look at the household survey, you see much lower job creation, and the household survey can be quite volatile, but it has no jobs created in the last three  months.  So that might be a signal that job creation \u2019s actually a little bit slower than we \u2019re seeing i n the \u2014in the  establishment survey.  So executive summary [is]:  I would say t here\u2019s some evidence that labor demand may be slowing a bit \u2014labor supply, not so much.  We have been disappointed that labor force participation really hasn \u2019t moved up since January.  That may be related to yet another big wave of COVID.  And there \u2019s evidence that that \u2019s the case.  But\u2014So we \u2019re not seeing much in the way of labor supply.  Nonetheless, I would say some , some  progress on demand and  supply gettin g back in alignment\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And then how much weakness would you be willing to accept before you think about pausing rate cuts?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I think we\u2019re looking\u2014 we\u2019re going to be looking at , at inflation as well.  You know, a s I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down.  We need to be    confident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate -consistent levels.  That \u2019s not something we can avoid doing.  That really needs to happen.  And, but we do think, though, that the labor ma rket can adjust because of the huge overhang of job openings , of excess demand, really.  There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than\u2014perhaps lower -than-expected increases in unemployment \u2014lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level \u2014the ratio of, of  vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience.  And that suggests that this time could be different.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  So you said that the path may be narrowed to avoiding a recession.  So how , how  close are we to a recession?  And then how do forecast s of possible recession from banks and economists, how does that make a soft landing you\u2019 ve talked about more difficult?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So as , as I mentioned, it doesn\u2019 t seem that the  U.S. economy is in recession right now.  And I think you do see weakening, some slowdown\u2014let \u2019s put it that way \u2014in growth.  And you see it across some of the categories that I mentioned.  But there \u2019s also just the very strong data coming out of the labor market, still.  So, overall, you would say that , in all probability, demand i s still strong , and, and the economy is still on track to continue to grow this year.  But the slowdown in the second quarter is notable.  And we \u2019re\u2014you know, we\u2019re  going to be watching that carefully.  Sorry, what was the \u2014\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Forecast s.  You know, how do bank forecast s of possible recessions, economists, does that affect the soft landing?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well , you know, w e\u2019ve said since the beginning, I think, that , that  having a soft landing is what we \u2019re aiming for.  Of course, that has t o be our goal .  It is our goal.  And we \u2019ll keep trying to achieve it.  I think \u2014I do think events \u2014at the beginning, we said it was not going to be easy.  It was going to be quite challenging to do that.  It\u2019s unusual.  It \u2019s an unusual event .  It\u2019s not a typical event , given where we are.  If there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned , that the labor market actually is \u2014has  such a large amount of surplus demand that you could see \u2014you could see that demand coming down in a way that didn \u2019t translate into a big increase in unemployment as you would expect in the ordinary course because , frankly, the imbalance is so much greater.  And, but we don\u2019 t know that.  I mean, t his is a\u2014this is a case of first impression.  So anyone who is  really sure that it\u2019 s impossible or really sure that it will happen is probably underestimating the level of uncertainty.  And so I would certainly say it \u2019s an uncertain , uncertain  thing.  Nonetheless, it \u2019s our goal to achieve it, and we \u2019ll keep trying to do that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Jean Yung with Market News.  I wanted to ask about the balance sheet reduction program.  It\u2019s been working for a couple months now and in a different environment than the last time the Fed did it.  What are you learning about how it \u2019s working and how markets are reacting?  And is reaching the minimum level of reserves needed in the system still s everal years away at the current pace?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we think it \u2019s working fine.  As you know, we , we tapered up into it.  And , and  in September, we \u2019ll go to full strength.  And the markets seem to have accepted it.  By all assessments, the market s should be able to absorb this.  And we expect that \u2019ll be the case.     So I would say the plan is broadly on track.  It\u2019s a little bit slow to get going because some of these trades  don\u2019t settle  until\u2014for a bit of time.  But it\u2019 ll be picking up steam.  So I guess your second question was getting\u2014the process of getting back down to the new equilibrium will take a while.  And that time, it\u2019 s hard to be precise, but , you know, the model would suggest that it could be between two, two and a half years, that kind of thing.  And this is a much faster pace than the last time.  Balance sheet \u2019s much , much bigger than it was.  But we looked  at this carefully , and we thought that this , this  was the sensible pace.  And we have no reason to think it \u2019s not.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  Looking at financial conditions, it seems like the tightening has slowed as of late with the 10  year coming down, 30- year fixed mortgage rates also going a bit sideways , when we talk about a hot housing market still.  Just wondering if you find financial conditions tight enough, especially as you continue to raise rates.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So a big piece of that is inflation expectations \u2014you know, breakevens coming down, w hich, you know, is a good thing.  It\u2019s a good thing that markets do seem to have confidence in , in the C ommittee \u2019s commitment to getting inflation back down to 2 percent .  So we like to see market -based , you know, readings  of inflation expectations come down.  You know, broader financial conditions have tightened, tightened a good bit.  I mean, t he way this works is we , we set our policy, and financial conditions react, and then financial conditions are what affects the economy.  And we don \u2019t control that second step.  We\u2019 re just going to do what we think needs to be done.  We\u2019 re going to\u2014 we\u2019re going to get our policy rate to a level where  we\u2019re confident that    inflation will be moving back down to 2 percent .  Confident.  So that \u2019s how we \u2019re going to take it.  And , of course, we \u2019ll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight and that they\u2019 re having the effect th at we would hope they\u2019 re having, which is to see demand moderate and inflationary pressures recede and , ultimately , inflation come down.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I wonder if you can go back a little bit in time to before there was this outbreak of inflation , when the Committee put in place forward guidance on tapering asset purchases.  I think it was December 2020.  There \u2019s a recent speech by Fed Governor Waller talking about that a nd saying that maybe that was too tight, that kind of condition, and it put you a little bit behind\u2014 not his words but maybe , you know, were kind of late to react to some of that inflation.  So could you talk about that decision , and have you looked at it in hindsig ht at all?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, ye s, we said that we wouldn\u2019 t lift off until we had basically achieved our dual -mandate goals.  And the reason we did it in real time was that , the first look at the new framework that we \u2019d rolled out, plenty of people were saying, \u201cI t\u2019s not credible .  You\u2019ll never get inflation to 2 percent .\u201d  Some of our critics now who say inflation\u2019 s too tight \u2014too high were the same ones who were saying , \u201cYou\u2019ll never get to 2  percent .\u201d  Well, but anyway , that\u2019s what happened.  So we , we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that.  It wasn \u2019t part of the framework.  The December \u201920 guidance was not part of our overall new framework.  I t was just guidance that we put in place.  So I would say two things.  One, I don\u2019 t think that that has materially changed the situation.  But I have to admit, I don\u2019 t think I would do that again.  I don\u2019t think I would do that again.  We \u2014you know, ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly    unexpected way for all of us.  And , you know, maybe the learning is that leave a little more flexibility than that.  But did it matter in the end?  You know, we \u2014if you look at \u2014I really don \u2019t think it did .  I\u2019m not sure it would\u2019 ve mattered if we \u2019d been raising rates three months earlier .  Does anybody think that would\u2019 ve made a big difference?  I mean, lots of central banks were raising rates three months earlier , and it didn\u2019 t matter.  I mean, this is a\u2014this is a  global ph enomenon that \u2019s happening now \u2014admittedly, different in the United States , but anyway.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Just a lot of people talk about that time , and they talk about a taper tantrum.  I know you haven\u2019 t talked about it too much but that you were worried at the time about repeating that taper tantrum that you had experienced as a G overnor.  So was that part of that?  Where did that fit into all those  decisions ?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I think we learned\u2014there \u2019ve been multiple taper tantrums, right?  So there was the famous one in 2013.  There \u2019s what happened at the December \u2019 18 meeting, where , you know, markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end and then suddenly react very sharply.  So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably and doing it in steps and things like that.  It was just like that\u2019 s how we did it.  And so we did it that way this time.  We were\u2014we were  careful  to, to take steps and communicate and all that kind of thing.  Ye s, we were trying to avoid a tantrum b ecause they can be quite destructive.  They can tighten financial conditions and knock the economy off kilter.  And, you know, when it happens, you have to\u2014really , in both \u2019 13 and \u2019 18, it really had consequences for the real    economy, you know, two, three, four months later.  So we were trying t o avoid that.  That was part of it.  Again, I don \u2019t think that\u2019 s\u2014the real issue of 2020 and \u2019 21 was just trying to understand what was happening with the reopening economy.  That , that  was where the big uncertainty was.  And, you know, our view was that these supply -side issues would get better :  that people would go back to work, that labor force participation would come back, e veryone would get vaccinated, schools would open, kids would be in school , and labor force participation would jump back up.  That\u2019s what we were\u2014that was very broadly thought to be the case :  these supply- side issues would get solved reasonably quickly.  A nd they just haven\u2019 t.  They still haven\u2019 t.  So that \u2019s really the learning , I think , is around how complicated these supply- side issues can be.  We haven \u2019t seen this before in a long, long time.  And so that \u2019s really , you know, what accounts for the pace at which we moved , and we did.  W hen inflation changed direction, really, in October , we\u2019ve moved quickly since then.  I thin k people would agree.  But before then, inflation was coming down month by month.  And , you know, we kind of thought we had the story \u2014probably had the story right.  But then, I think in October, you started to see a range of data that said \u201cN o.  This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we \u2019ve been thinking. \u201d  And, again, we \u2019ve pivoted, and here we are.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I just want to pin you down a little bit more on the issue of recession.  So if we get a negative GDP number tomorrow for the second quarter, would the Fed consider the  U.S. in a recession?  And just remind us , what is your definition for the start of a recession?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So the Fed doesn\u2019 t make a \u2014doesn\u2019t make a  judgment on that.  You know, w e\u2019re focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment and price stability.  We don \u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t  say \u201cT here is now a recession \u201d and that kind of thing.  So that wouldn\u2019 t be something we \u2019d do.  We would look at the data tomorrow \u2014and no doubt, we\u2019ll look at it very carefully \u2014and draw whatever implications we can.  As I mentioned, though, you know, if you think about what an inflatio n\u2014sorry, what a recession really is, it \u2019s a broad- based decline across many industries that , you know, is sustain ed for more than a couple of months , and there are a bunch of specific tests in it.  And  it just doesn\u2019t \u2014this just doesn\u2019 t seem like that now.  What we have right now doesn\u2019 t seem like that.  And the real reason is that the labor market is just sending such a signal of economic strength that it makes you really question the GDP data.  But , again, that \u2019s not a decision that we \u2014that we make.  And w e won \u2019t\u2014we won\u2019t  reach a conclusion one way or another on that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you very much.  Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist .  You said that some softening in the labor market is needed.  Within the F ed, there are staff economists who \u2019ve argue d that N AIRU, the noninflationary rate of unemployment, might be as high as 5 to 6 percent  right now , which obviously is a lot higher than the current rate of 3.6.  What \u2019s your assessment of N AIRU?  Is that something that came up in discussion with the C ommittee?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the \u2014that the  natural  rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we think it was before.  And the reason is there\u2019s \u2014it\u2019 s the usual matching issue , where m atching has become less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and    the big switches in demand from services to goods and all that.  So it could be higher.  And my own instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher.  Of course, I would add that we don\u2019t know  it.  We can never know where these star variables are in real time w ith any confidence.  But I would say it must have move d up materiall y.  But the other side of that is , as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and unemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly.  And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation b ecause it \u2019s that gap\u2014 it\u2019s the gap between actual unemployment and the \u2014and the  natural rate that really is relevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy w ith the overtight labor market.  So  if you were to\u2014you wouldn\u2019 t observe this.  It\u2019s an unobservabl e, but you could actually be seeing inflationary pressures com ing down if that does happen.  And we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019t  control that.  But that \u2019s something that, logically , if the pandemic and the disorder in the labor market caused the natural rate to move up, then as the labor market settles down, in principle, you should see it move back down.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.  Just a question about \u2014hate to keep banging the drum about recession.  But most of the polls that we \u2019re seeing now from the public, people believe that we \u2019re already in a recession or heading for one\u2014economists, pretty much the same thing.  They \u2019re being told by folks like you and the Administration that we \u2019re not in a recession, we \u2019re not heading for a recession\u2014frankly, coming from the same people who  told them inflation was transitory , telling them now that we \u2019re not heading for a recession.  So wh at would you tell the public to reassure them now that you feel    confident in your forecast going forward and the Fed is ready to respond to a \u2014to a  potential downturn in the economy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: No, a ll I\u2019ve really said is I don \u2019t think it\u2019 s likely that the U .S. economy\u2019 s in a recession now .  And I \u2019ve explained why that is the case.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s because you do see a very strong labor market.  And I think the public will see that as well.  You know, going forward, what we \u2019ve seen is a\u2014is a slowing in spending, a s I mentioned.  We\u2019ve seen the very beginnings of perhaps a slight lessening in the \u2014in the  tightness of the labor market, but it would only be the beginnings.  So, and I mentioned that , that \u2014I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down a nd have a so -called soft landing , by which I mean a landing that doesn\u2019 t require a significant increase, a really significant increase in unemployment.  We \u2019re trying to achieve that.

Kyle Campbell with American Banker.   The FOMC has historically trie d to avoid the kind of rapid monetary policy tightening that has happened so far this year.  How concerned are you that the rate hikes that we \u2019ve seen thus far might increase risks to financial stability not just domestically, but globally ?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I mean , there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly \u2014for example, in 1994, and in 1980, even more  so.  So we \u2019ve been known to do that when it \u2019s the appropriate thing to do.  And this year, it clearly is.  I would say that , given how quickly we \u2019ve moved, I \u2019m gratified that while \u2014that, basically , markets have been working.  T hey\u2019ve been orderly.  There \u2019s been some volatility, but that \u2019s only to be expected.     For a financial stability perspective, you know, asset values are down , which in some \u2014in some  sense lowers vulnerabilities.  It\u2019s when they \u2019re really high that you would worry that they\u2019 re\u2014that they\u2019re  vulnerable to a fall, actually.  Many asset values have come down.  I think you\u2019ve got a well -capitalized banking system.  I think you have \u2014households are generally in about as strong as financial shape as they \u2019ve been in a very long time or perhaps ever given the money that \u2019s on people \u2019s balance sheets.  So you have a pretty\u2014from a financial stability standpoint , you have a pretty decent picture .  Now, the macroeconomic, there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don \u2019t rise to the level of financial stability concerns.  By financial stability, you know, we think of that as things that might undermine the working of the financial system , so big, serious things.  That \u2019s not to say that people at the lower end of the income spectrum aren\u2019t , aren\u2019t suffering , because they are.  They \u2019re suffering from high inflation.  They\u2019re  going to the \u2014to the grocery store and finding that, in many cases, their p aycheck doesn \u2019t cover the food they\u2019 re accustomed to buying.  We\u2019 re seeing actual , you know, real declines in food consumption.  And, you know, it\u2019 s very concerning.  It\u2019s very unfortunate.

Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.  I can remember when you held your first news conference , and you vowed to be a very plainspoken Chairman , and we \u2019re thinking today about the impacts of Fed policy on individuals as well.  What would you say to individuals or households who may yet lose their jobs in this tightening cycle in the fight against inflatio n as they try to translate what Fed  policy means to them in this complicated economic landscape?  Thank you.   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: .  So I guess the first thing I would say to , to every household is that we know that inflation is too high.  We understand how painf ul it is , particularly for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and spend most of that paycheck on necessities, such as food and gas a nd heating their homes and clothing and things like that.  We do understand that , that  those people suffer the most.  Middle -class and better -off people have some resources, where they can absorb these things.

We are assigned uniquely and unconditionall y the obligation of , of providing price stability to the American people.  And we \u2019re going to use our tools to do that.  As I mentioned, there will be some, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions.  We need growth to slow to below potential growth.  We don\u2019 t want to \u2014we don\u2019 t want this to be bigger than it needs to be .  But, ultimately , if you think about the medium and longer term, price stability is the thing that , that  makes the whole economy work.  It \u2019s what can\u2014it can  give us a strong labor market and wages that aren \u2019t being eaten up by high inflation.  If you talk to people \u2014again, people who are making, you know, wages, relatively low wages\u2014they\u2019 re the ones who are suffering the most from inflation.  So it \u2019s all the more  reason why we need to move , move  on this.

In light of this, the FOMC has raised its policy interest rate and plans to continue increasing it, while also reducing the size of its balance sheet.Consumer spending has slowed due to lower income and tighter financial conditions, while the housing sector has weakened because of higher mortgage rates. Business fixed investment has also declined, but the labor market remains tight with low unemployment, high job vacancies, and elevated wage growth. Despite these economic developments, inflation remains above the target goal of 2 percent.The consumer price index exceeded expectations in June, with a 9.1 percent increase over the past year, while the core CPI rose by 5.9 percent. Despite a recent economic slowdown, aggregate demand remains strong, supply constraints have been greater than anticipated, and price pressures are evident across various goods and services. The surge in crude oil and other commodity prices due to Russia's war on Ukraine has contributed to higher prices for gasoline and food, further increasing inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve is committed to its mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, recognizing the hardship high inflation imposes on individuals, particularly those with limited means. The Fed is actively working to return inflation to its 2 percent objective and has raised the target range for the federal funds rate by \u00c2\u00be of a percentage point to 2\u00c2\u00bc to 2\u00c2\u00bd percent. Additionally, the Fed is reducing the size of its balance sheet to strengthen monetary policy. In the coming months, the Fed will closely monitor evidence of inflation moving down and aligning with the 2 percent target. Ongoing increases in the federal funds rate are expected, with the pace dependent on incoming data and the economic outlook.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to increase the target range for the second time in a row, but future increases will depend on upcoming data. The FOMC aims to balance demand and supply, bring down inflation, and respond flexibly to uncertainties in the economy.The FOMC expects a period of below-trend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions, which are necessary to restore price stability and achieve maximum employment and stable prices in the long run. They acknowledge the impact of their actions on communities, families, and businesses, and are committed to doing everything they can to achieve their goals.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Can you explain why the decision was made to not increase rates by a full percentage point and if there was any discussion of a stronger hike at this meeting?\n\n'ANSWER': We determined that a 75 basis point increase was appropriate given the data and the ongoing rate increases. We would not hesitate to make a larger move if necessary, but that was not the case at this meeting. There was broad support for the decision. We had previously stated that we would move more aggressively if inflation continued to disappoint, which is why we increased the pace in June. In this meeting, we continued at that pace due to continued inflation disappointment in the June CPI reading.", "'QUESTION': How will the Committee weigh the expected decline in headline inflation against the persistence in core readings, and how has their thinking changed on how far rates might need to go?\n'ANSWER': The Committee's focus is on using tools to bring demand back into balance with supply and bring inflation down. They will be looking at economic activity, labor market conditions, and inflation to assess the outlook. The goal is to determine if the current policy stance is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to the 2 percent target. The Committee believes that policy needs to reach at least a moderately restrictive level, with the median federal funds rate projected to be between 3\u00c2\u00bc and 3\u00c2\u00bd percent by the end of this year. The decision on rate hikes will be made based on incoming data and will be assessed meeting by meeting. Clear guidance on the path to neutral will no longer be provided.", "'QUESTION': Are the current expectations of raising rates this year and lowering them next year consistent with the need to keep financial conditions tight and bring inflation back to 2 percent?\n\n'ANSWER': It is difficult to predict the economy's future in normal times, and there is significant uncertainty now. The best estimate is that the Committee aims for a moderately restrictive level by the end of this year, around 3 to 3\u00c2\u00bd percent. Further rate increases in 2023 will be updated at the September meeting.", "'QUESTION': Has the FOMC's view of the terminal rate changed since June?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC did not expect a good reading on inflation, but it turned out to be worse than expected. The terminal rate is a personal estimate that will evolve over time based on data such as CPI readings, labor market readings, economic activity, and geopolitical developments. The decision will be made at the September meeting based on this data.", "'QUESTION': In the event of weak headline inflation but strong core inflation, how would you assess the situation and make policy decisions?\n'ANSWER': We would consider both measures of inflation and assess whether we are confident that inflation is moving towards our target of 2 percent. Core inflation is a better predictor of future inflation, but sustained supply shocks can undermine inflation expectations, which we need to take into consideration in our policymaking.", "'QUESTION': Do you share the President's confidence in not being in a recession? And, second, how would or would not a recession change policy?\n'ANSWER': We believe it is necessary for growth to slow down and for there to be a period of growth below potential in order to create slack and allow the supply side to catch up. We also expect some softening in labor market conditions, which we believe are necessary to bring inflation back down to 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': Do you see a recession coming and how might that change policy?\n'ANSWER': We are focused on getting inflation back down as price stability is crucial for a strong economy. We want to restore the labor market to pre-pandemic levels with low inflation and high participation. This is not a tradeoff with employment, but a way to achieve it in the long term.", "'QUESTION': Does the bias remain that the risks of doing too little outweigh the risks of doing too much?\n'ANSWER': We are trying to do the right amount to avoid a recession and bring down inflation while sustaining a strong labor market. Restoring price stability is necessary for a sustained period of strong labor market conditions. We see both sides of the dual mandate as aligned on this.", "'QUESTION': Do you believe the United States is currently in a recession? Will the GDP reading tomorrow affect that judgment one way or the other? And has your assessment of the risk of recession changed any in recent weeks?\n'ANSWER': I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession. There are too many areas of the economy performing well, particularly the labor market. Although growth is slowing, the labor market remains strong with high job growth, low unemployment rate, and strong wage measures. Therefore, it doesn't make sense for the economy to be in a recession.", "'QUESTION': GDP? GDP tomorrow?\n'ANSWER': I haven't seen it yet, so we'll have to wait and see. GDP numbers often get revised significantly, as it's challenging to estimate the cumulative GDP of a large economy like the US. We take initial GDP reports with caution, but of course, we'll be examining it.", "QUESTION: Some senators are asking for more transparency and stronger rules regarding the Fed officials' financial activity. Will the Fed be toughening those rules?\n\nANSWER: The new conflict-of-interest rules implemented by the Fed are the toughest in any comparable institution. Trades will require pre-clearance and must be made at least 45 days before any FOMC meeting. The Fed believes these rules will build public trust and is proud of the robust set of regulations put in place.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk about the factors that go into deciding how much to raise rates and if there could be a 100 basis point increase? Is there any weakness in the economy that would slow down the hiking pace?\n'ANSWER': We consider activity, labor market, and inflation when deciding on our policy stance. As we approach neutral, it will be appropriate to slow down rate increases. We haven't decided on the exact timing or the possibility of a 100 basis point increase. We will carefully analyze data and make a decision in September. The June SEP is a good guide for our future actions.", "'QUESTION': How will the Federal Reserve handle the divergence between the preferred measure of inflation, the PCE index, and the public's measure, the CPI, if the PCE starts to decrease while the CPI remains high?\n\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve acknowledges the difference between the PCE and CPI, with the CPI having higher weights on certain items. However, they believe the PCE is a better measure of inflation. While they are aware of the public's focus on the CPI, they will continue to target the PCE and expect the two measures to eventually converge.", "'QUESTION': Where is the Federal Reserve in terms of their target and how do they determine where they need to get to?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman acknowledges a slowing in demand in the second quarter, but also highlights the strength of the labor market. While there is uncertainty about the extent of the moderation in demand, the economy is expected to perform well in the second half of the year. The Federal Reserve will closely monitor the data to determine the necessary actions to create slack and lower inflation.", "'QUESTION': When does the Committee expect to see a meaningful slowdown in the labor market? And how much weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before it pauses or begins to think about cutting rates?\n'ANSWER': The labor market has already seen a decline in job creation, but it is still robust. There is some evidence of moderating wages and a decrease in concern from businesses about finding workers. Overall, there is a feeling that the labor market is moving back into balance, although labor force participation has not increased since January.", "'QUESTION': How much weakness would the FOMC be willing to accept before considering pausing rate cuts?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC will be monitoring inflation and the need for it to come down to mandate-consistent levels. However, they believe that the labor market can adjust due to the high number of job openings, which could result in lower-than-expected increases in unemployment. The current ratio of vacancies to unemployed suggests a potential difference in the usual outcome.", "'QUESTION': How close are we to a recession and how do forecasts of a possible recession make a soft landing more difficult?\n'ANSWER': It doesn't seem that the US economy is in a recession right now, but there is a slowdown in growth. However, the strong data from the labor market suggests that demand is still strong and the economy is on track to continue growing this year. The slowdown in the second quarter is notable and will be closely monitored.", "'QUESTION': How do bank forecasts of possible recessions and economists affect the soft landing?\n'ANSWER': Achieving a soft landing is the goal, but it is challenging and uncertain. The labor market's surplus demand could potentially decrease without causing a significant increase in unemployment. However, the level of uncertainty is high, and it is an unusual event. Nonetheless, the goal remains to achieve a soft landing.", "'QUESTION': What is the current assessment of the balance sheet reduction program and how are markets reacting? How long will it take to reach the minimum level of reserves needed in the system?\n'ANSWER': The balance sheet reduction program is working fine and the markets have accepted it. The process of reaching the new equilibrium will take around two to two and a half years, which is faster than the last time. The current pace is considered sensible and there is no reason to believe it won't be successful.", "QUESTION: Do you find financial conditions tight enough, especially as you continue to raise rates?\n\nANSWER: We like to see market-based readings of inflation expectations come down, as it shows confidence in our commitment to getting inflation back to 2 percent. While financial conditions have tightened, we don't control the second step of how it affects the economy. We will continue to raise rates until we are confident inflation will decrease.", "'QUESTION': Can you discuss the decision to put in place forward guidance on tapering asset purchases and whether it was a mistake in hindsight?\n'ANSWER': We implemented forward guidance to demonstrate the credibility of our new framework and address skepticism about achieving our inflation target. While it wasn't part of the overall framework, I wouldn't make the same decision again. However, it likely wouldn't have made a significant difference given the unexpected global phenomenon of inflation.", "'QUESTION': Was the concern about avoiding a taper tantrum a factor in the decisions made by the FOMC?\n'ANSWER': Yes, the FOMC was careful to avoid a taper tantrum as it can have destructive effects on the economy. They learned from previous instances in 2013 and 2018 and developed a practice of moving predictably and communicating steps. The focus in 2020 and 2021 was understanding the reopening economy and the supply-side issues that have been more complicated than anticipated. The FOMC adjusted its approach when inflation changed direction in October.", "'QUESTION': If the US gets a negative GDP number for the second quarter, would the Fed consider it a recession and what is the Fed's definition of a recession?\n'ANSWER': The Fed doesn't make a judgment on whether there is a recession or not. They focus on their dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. They will carefully analyze the data and draw implications, but the current economic strength in the labor market makes them question the GDP data.", "'QUESTION': What is the assessment of the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) and its impact on inflation?\n'ANSWER': The natural rate of unemployment is believed to have increased significantly due to the matching issue and the turbulent downturn caused by the pandemic. While it is uncertain, it is likely to have moved up materially. However, as the labor market settles down and more jobs are created, the unemployment rate could come back down, reducing inflationary pressures.", "'QUESTION': What would you tell the public to reassure them now that you feel confident in your forecast going forward and the Fed is ready to respond to a potential downturn in the economy?\n'ANSWER': All I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve really said is I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that the U.S. economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a recession now. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve explained why that is the case, citing a strong labor market. Going forward, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a slowing in spending and a slight lessening in the tightness of the labor market, but our goal is to achieve a soft landing without a significant increase in unemployment. We understand it's challenging.", "'QUESTION': How concerned are you that the rate hikes might increase risks to financial stability domestically and globally?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC has moved quickly in the past when necessary, and this year it is appropriate. Markets have been working well despite some volatility. Asset values have come down, which lowers vulnerabilities. The banking system is well-capitalized and households are in strong financial shape. While there are macroeconomic issues, they don't rise to the level of financial stability concerns. However, lower-income individuals are suffering from high inflation, which is concerning and why the FOMC is committed to bringing down inflation.", "'QUESTION': What would you say to individuals or households who may yet lose their jobs in this tightening cycle in the fight against inflation as they try to translate what Fed policy means to them in this complicated economic landscape?\n'ANSWER': We understand the pain of high inflation, especially for those living paycheck to paycheck. We are committed to providing price stability and will use our tools to achieve that. While there may be some softening in labor market conditions, price stability is crucial for a strong economy and wages that aren't eroded by inflation."]}
