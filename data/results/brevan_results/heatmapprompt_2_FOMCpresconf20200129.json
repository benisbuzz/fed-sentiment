[["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr. Chairman, I would like you to comment in a little bit more depth about one small change I\u2019ve noted in the statement.  It notes that policy will be appropriate to bring\u2014the Committee belie ves\u2014inflation back to the Committee \u2019s 2 percent symmetric inflation objective.  That\u2019s a slight change from the last time , when you w ere expecting it to bring inflation outcomes back near the objective.  And I would put this also in the context of a comment you made at the last press conference where you drew attention to the fact that a number of policymakers had projected inflation overshoots two or three years out under appropriate mone tary policy.  Should we take all of this together to mean simply that the Committee is more confident that a 2  percent outcome for inflation is already baked in the cake , or that this is a signal that the Committee has a stronger resolution to bring inflat ion at least to the 2  percent objective and put \u2014bring into play an informal makeup strategy for inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  So, in making that change, our goal was , really \u2014that was, changing \u201c near\u201d to \u201creturning to \u201d\u2014was to avoid possible misinterpretat ion.  So you may remember , in the December minutes we noted that a few Committee members suggested that the language that stated that monetary policy would support inflation near  2 percent  could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfor table with inflation running below that level.  So we thought about that in the intermeeting period and concluded that it would be appropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we\u2019re not comfortable with inflation rising persistently \u2014running persistently below our 2 percent symmetric objective.  So,   yes, there is something in that.  It\u2019s just that we wanted to underscore our commitment to 2 percent not being a ceiling to inflation running around\u2014symmetrically around 2 percent , and that we \u2019re not satisfied  with inflation running below 2 percent, particularly at a time such as now where we\u2019re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment when, in theory, inflation should be moving up\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Than k you.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.   I want to ask about the balance sheet.  How many reserves are \u201cample \u201d?  How many reserves does the Fed now think it will need to conduct policy in its current framework?  And can you walk me through how you and your colleagues are arriving at that answer?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So, thanks for that question.  Why don\u2019t I say a few things about repos , since I know that\u2019ll be of interest.  So , just to bring you back, after last September\u2019s brief turmoil, we took prompt and decisive action , and a result \u2014as a result,  money markets have been operating smoothly since then.  Just to review, those two adjustments were Treasury bill purchases of at least \u2014of $60 billion \u2014sorry\u2014at least in to the second quarter, and term and  overnight repo at least  through April.  And I will get to your specific question. The purpose of the adjustments has been to assure that our policy is transmitted smoothly to the federal funds rate, which requires well -functioning money markets.  It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re trying to eliminate all volatility in the repo markets.  We know that some volatility is normal and expected in well -functioning markets.  And, as I mentioned, these adjustments have been successful in supplying an ample quantity of reserves.  Money markets operated smoothly, including right through year -end, and the fed funds  rate has remained in our target range.  So we know \u2014we will know when these adjustments have run their course  when reserves are durably at   a level that enables us to control the federal funds rate using our administered rates, the interest on reserves and reverse repo , without the need for frequent use of open market operations. Based on current projections, we expect that the bill purchases will durably bring the underlying level of reserves to the ample level sometime in the second quarter of this year.  And when we see that we\u2019ve reached that level, we\u2019ll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to the level of the unde rlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities.  As our bill purchases bring the underlying level of reserves up to an ample level on a sustained basis, the necessary quantity of overnight and term repo will gradually decline.  We\u2019ve already begun the gradual reduction in the quantity of repo, and we\u2019ll continue to reduce those offering amounts gradually as conditions permit.  At some point, we\u2019ll also raise the minimum bid rate.  Even after we reach an ample level of reserves, it\u2019s possible that repo operations might play a role as a backstop and support effective control of the federal funds rate.  And we\u2019ll continue to discuss that issue and review it under our implementation framework. Coming to your question, in terms of the actually desired reserve level, we know that reserves will continue to move up and down over the course of the calendar year in a wide range depending on volatility in nonreserve liabilities, particularly the Treasury General Account , or TGA.  In particular, reserve levels will ne ed to be at a level high enough to remain ample even when the TGA peaks during the April tax season.  Effectively, what that means is that we need reserves at all times to be no lower than they were in early September \u2014and, I would say, around $1\u00bd trillion , subject to learning more.  Reserves are going to move in a broad range, as I mentioned, and we want to be clear , that will be the bottom end of the range.  We want $1\u00bd trillion or thereabouts to be the bottom end of the range.  So, most of the time , reser ves will be moving in a range substantially higher than that but not going below $1\u00bd trillion .   So it\u2019s not an \u2014it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re aiming at all the time.  We know that reserves will fluctuate and be substantially higher than that most of the time.  We also want interest on excess reserves and the fed funds rate to be well within the FOMC\u2019s target range.  And we think that\u2019ll be the case now that we made our technical adjustment.  Last points \u2014we\u2019re committed to making this adjustment process a smooth one.  We\u2019ll provide more details as we go, and we expect to learn as we go , as we always have.  And we\u2019re prepared to adjust the details of the plan as necessary to foster efficient and effective monetary policy implementation\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.  Following up on Nick\u2019s question, I know you said it\u2019s not QE , but it\u2019s $390 billion over five months, which is a lot to expand the balance sheet.  I guess I\u2019d ask one more time on Nick\u2019s question\u2014 is there a number that you have in mind?  Secondly, a lot of people in the market are sort of concerned that it looks like QE , and they\u2019re trading that way.  Are you concerned that the market is embracing this like a QE program , and that the rise in the stoc k market is linked to it , and you may then experience something of a \u201c taper tantrum \u201d the way Chairman Bernanke did when he tried to roll it off?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I\u2019ll just\u2014I\u2019ll repeat that \u2014we think that the \u2014we think we need to continue purchases until the \u2014until reserves are at a level at which they will not go below $1\u00bd trillion , roughly, during the course of the calendar year.  And we know that the TGA will move up and down there .  So they\u2019ll be much higher than that some  of the time , but that\u2019s kind of the number , and we think we\u2019ll reach that sometime in the second quarter.  That\u2019s our estimate.  But we will\u2014 we\u2019ll know it when we get there.  We\u2019ll know it because we\u2019ll be able to   be\u2014to control the federal funds rate without use of \u2014without active use, ongoing use of open market operations.  You know, our intention of these \u2014for these adjustments is just to raise the level of reserves and to allow us to conduct monetary policy in an efficient and effective manner.  And that\u2019s \u2014that is our sole intention.  I pointed out on other occasions , more than once , the differences \u2014the really specific differences between this and the large- scale asset purchase programs.  We\u2019ve been over that.  In terms of what affects markets, you know, I think many things affect markets.  It\u2019s very hard to say with any precision at any time what is affecting markets.  What I can tell you is that you know what our intention is.  It is to return reserves to an ample level.  We expect that to happen during the second quarter.  And our plan as we do that is , as those purchases get to that level, we believe we can gradually reduce them, and we believe we can also gradually reduce repo as\u2014as we reach an ample level, as we\u2019re satisfying demand now more from underlying reserves from bill purchases rather than from repo. And, again, the last thing I\u2019ll say is , we\u2019re prepared to adjust the details of this plan as we\u2019ve shown ourselves willing to do depending on conditions\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell .  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.   I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the labor market.  We\u2019ve recently seen wages moderating a little bit by some measures, maybe even declining a little bit by others.  As you mentioned, at the lower end of the sort of talent pool, it see ms like we are seeing those wages climb up a little bit, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be consistent across the entire sort of average.  I was wondering if you\u2019d  talk a little bit about whether you guys are noticing any cracks , or whether you\u2019re worried about tha t, or how you\u2019re thinking about it.  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: The l abor market continues to\u2014to  perform well.  The labor market continues to be strong.  We see strong job creation.  We see low unemployment.  Very importantly, we see labor force participation continuin g to move up, really , against expectations.  If you go back a few years, you will not find a lot of forecast s suggesting that we could have been at 63.2 percent overall labor force participation or the levels of employment to population that we\u2019re seeing n ow, let alone the  unemployment level.  So I think we\u2019ve learned quite a lot of good things about the labor market, good things suggesting that there\u2019s been more room to run. The performance of wages, I think , has to be seen in that context.  We saw \u2014if you go back four or five years, the four or five major wage statistics that we track were running at around 2 percent, and now they\u2019re running at around 3 percent, which is theoretically about where th ey might be at full employment.  It would consist of inflat ion plus \u2014plus  productivity growth.  The \u2014it\u2019s a bit surprising that, with sustained levels of historically low unemployment , we haven\u2019t seen wages moving up above that level as we have in other long expansions and other periods of low unemployment. So you a sked, what can be explaining that ?  You know, one thing can be that the natural rate of unemployment is still lower than we think, that the labor market is not as tight as it would appear just from the 3\u00bd percent number.  And the other can be , I think , that \u2014as I mentioned, the sort of supply- side shock or surprise that we\u2019re receiving from higher labor force participation.  People are coming in to the labor market and providing more labor supply , and that is \u2014that \u2019s a great thing.  That\u2019s a very healthy thing.  We\u2019re a country that has low labor force participation compared to  essentially all of our advanced -economy peers , and it\u2019s a very good, positive thing.  Nonetheless , it represents more labor supply, and it may be holding down wages. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  In terms of the framework review and a little bit on Chris\u2019s question earlier, there is a general feeling now in the markets and among analysts that you\u2019re basically setting us up for some form of inflat ion-target averaging where you let the inflation rate run above the 2 percent target for some time to make up for the time that it has  spent below that.  Is that a fair or reasonable assessment of where you think you\u2019re going to end up?  What would you, Chairman Powell, think of that idea personally ?  And, as long as I\u2019m asking, do you have any more details on when we can expect the results of the review\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thanks.  I\u2019ll just say that we undertook the review because we felt , and I felt , that it was time to incorporate the realities of what we could call the \u201c new normal \u201d into our policy framework.  And some aspects of that new normal would include ongoing powerful global disinflationary trends, which have led to lower -than-target infla tion many places in the world; s econdly, a flat Phillips curve , by which I mean low levels of sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization \u2014for example , low unemployment; a nd, thirdly, a much lower neutral real interest rate here and around the world.  So those ar e challenging conditions for monetary policy to deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices, although I would say that , under our existing framework, we\u2019ve been able to succeed or get close to succeeding it for most of the tim e lately to achieve those goals , although we do struggle , as other central banks do, with the inflation goal.  So this is about reviewing our strategy , tools , and communications to assure that they\u2019re the best that we can do to achieve those goals in this envi ronment on a sustained basis.  And we continued our discussions at this meeting.  I\u2019m very, very pleased at the process so far.  It\u2019s included the 14 Fed Listens events around the country, at which we\u2019ve engaged with a full range   of people and groups across American society.  That was a very, very positive experience, and I think we learned a lot.  We \u2019ve now had a series of \u2014a number of FOMC meetings at which we\u2019ve reviewed what we\u2019ve learned and also dug deeply into strategy , tools , and communications.  I expect that we will conclude the review and announce our conclusions around the middle of the year.  Right now, we are just at the point of coming together to put all that together. So I think I\u2019m not the person who should be telling you my personal pr eferences right now.  I\u2019m trying to\u2014a nd we were trying to come together as a group around a  set of answers.  I feel very positive about \u2014that we\u2019re going to come up with some good results, and I\u2019m just going to have to wait until we get to that point to announce them.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Donna Borak with CNN.  Going back to your outlook for global growth, we\u2019ve seen some significant headwinds , as you mentioned earlie r, with the easing \u2014with the partial U.S. \u2013China trade deal , but now that there\u2019s some new concern fo llowing the outbreak of the coronavirus \u2014that it might shake global growth.  We\u2019re already seeing reports from Ford and Toyota that they\u2019re planning to shut down their assembly plants for an extra week.  Apple is rerouting their supply chains.  Starbucks is  shutting down close to thousands of stores.  Are you worried at all about what the impact would be  on the U.S. economy, and do you see that as a significant risk \u2014excuse me\u2014to the outlook at this point \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So let me talk about the coronavirus s pecifically, and then I\u2019ll turn more to global growth more generally.  First, it\u2019s a \u2014it\u2019s a  very serious issue , and I want to start by acknowledging the significant and considerable human suffering that the virus is already causing.  There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on   the spread of the virus to date and the travel restrictions and business closures that have already been imposed. Of course, the situation is really in its early stages , and it\u2019s very unce rtain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be in China and its immediate trading partners and neighbors and around the world.  So, in light of that uncertainty, I\u2019m not going to speculate about it at this point.  I w ill just  tell you that, of course, we are very carefully monitoring the situation.  And, you know, as you suggested, our framework ultimately is , what are the potent ial ramifications for the U.S. economy and for the achievement of our dual mandate ?  More broadly, though, if I can talk about the global economy for a second\u2014 and if you look at the backdrop, you know, if you go back to 2017, that was the year of synchronized growth that lasted into the middle of 2018, and then you saw slowing in growth, which lasted right through the end of last year.  The fourth- quarter growth globally was quite weak last year , and a number of factors played into that.  It wasn\u2019t any one factor.  There was trade policy uncertainty, absolutely, but also there was the decision by the Chinese authorities to try to rein in leverage and financial excesses.  There was a turn \u2014downturn in the global high -tech manufacturing cycle in global auto production.  There were some idiosyncratic strains in some countries like Argentina , Turkey.  A nd then, later,  in Hong Kong and Chile , you had social unrest.  So, all of those things were playing into that cycle of weakening growth over the cours e of 2019 and the last half  of \u201918. I would say,  now there are grounds for what I would call \u201c cautious optimism \u201d about the outlook now for the global economy.  Many analysts are predicting a pick up in growth this year, although still to relatively modest growth rates .  And I would\u2014people are pointing to , and we   would point to, support ive financial co nditions, the easing of trade tensions, the lower odds of a hard Brexit.  The high- tech manufacturing industry does appear to be rebounding well in Asia, including in China.  The latest indicators \u2014manufacturing PMIs , for example \u2014suggest that manufacturing may have bottomed out , that they\u2019re still below 50 in many jurisdictions , but they have moved up off of their lows.  I would\u2014I would just say, none of this is assured.  As I mentioned, we saw the fourth quarter of last year came in quite weak \u2014weak er than ex pected.  We are not at all assured of a global rebound, but there are signs and reasons to expect it.  And then comes the coronavirus , which, again, it\u2019s too early to say what the effects will be.  Of course, we\u2019re, as I mentioned, monitoring it carefully.  There will clearly be implications , at least in the near term , for Chinese output and, I would guess , for some of their close -in neighbors , and we\u2019ll just have to see what the effect is globally.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times.   As recently as 2018, interest on excess reserves was at the top of the band, sort of dragging the fed funds rate up.  Over the course of the adjustments since last year , it\u2019s moved steadily down, closer to the bottom of the band.  So, if you\u2019re moving it back up, how high do you want to get it?  Are we looking to get interest on excess reserves at the top of the band again as the fed funds rate moves to the middle of the band?   And should we see movements in IOER as an indicator that we\u2019re approachi ng \u201cample \u201d\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So our stated goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well within the range.  That\u2019s it.  W ell within the range.  And that , clearly, you know \u20145 basis points from the bottom or from the top isn\u2019t that.  So that\u2019s why we moved back up.  You\u2019re right.  Last year we were\u2014we saw some tightness as reserves were draining out of the system.  We saw   the\u2014gradually moving up.  And, in hindsight , we know what was happening.  With ample reserves, we see\u2014we see that it\u2019s possible to bri ng the interest on reserves rate up to 10 basis points.

So you don\u2019t think that , as the fed funds goes back up towards the center of the range , that IOER is going to end up at the top?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Don\u2019t know that.  We want  it to be well within the range.  I think we\u2019ll continue to adjust it to the extent it\u2019s appropriate.  Ultimately , what we\u2019re trying to do is deliver a federal funds rate that\u2019s well within the range .  IOER is just a tool to do that.  If we \u2014if we need to make changes to keep it well within the range, we\u2019ll do that .  It just means \u2014I mean , the thing that matters for the economy is that we keep the federal funds rate \u2014which is the rate that, of course , transmits into other money market rates , which ultimately transmit into all kinds of financial conditions \u2014that\u2019s what we care about.

Will the re be preset amounts like you\u2019re doing now , or will that just be something that people will have  to sort of intuit and figure out as you go along?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I\u2019ll go in reverse order.  When we \u2014when we  make decisions about the steps we\u2019re going to be taking in that adjustment process that I described at some length, we\u2019ll be making them as earl y as we can and as transparently as we can \u2014and specifically.  But we\u2019re not at that stage.  It\u2019s January , and we\u2019re several months away from \u2014from  that.  In terms of the standing repo facility, as I mentioned  in, I guess , in my answer to an earlier question,  there may well be a role for repo in this system even after we\u2019re at an ample-reserves level.  Now, we haven\u2019t decided what that role is, we have not decided \u2014we haven\u2019t at all made a decision on a standing repo facility .  We haven\u2019t.  We \u2019ve had a couple of discussions about it , as you know , back in, I guess , June and October.  And there\u2019s a range of views .  We\u2019re going to return, I would say, fairly soon to this question.

I\u2019m wondering, do you think that there is a financial stability risk from climate change?  Yo u\u2019ve spoken several times that you think severe weather events are happening more often and that the Fed is monitoring what that could physically do to a bank or a financial institution, but that \u2019s sort of one institution.  Do you think there\u2019s a systemwide risk that may \u2014that could develop from climate change?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So that\u2019s an interesting question\u2014the  question being,  is there a systemwide financial stability risk?  I\u2019d say , over \u2014over  the longer term , it\u2019s certainly possible , and I would say that sort of feeds into the way we\u2019re thinking about climate change as an institution.  So, as I\u2019ve mentioned, climate change is an important issue, a very important issue , but it\u2019s essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federa l government and state governments for leadership on that.  And, importantly , society\u2019s overall response to climate change needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed. All of that said, if you look at our mandate, we\u2019ve got a monetary polic y mandate and, more immediately perhaps, a supervisory mandate where we\u2019re supervising financial markets, utilities , and financial institutions , banks .  And we haven\u2019t \u2014we share overall responsibility for financial stability with a number of agencies.  And that latter part\u2014I think the public has every right to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust against the risks from climate change.  Now, I think that\u2019s got to be right .  We are in the very early stages, as are other central banks , in understanding just what that means.  And there\u2019s quite a lot of work going on around the world at other central banks and at the Fed, too, to think that through.  But I do think it\u2019s \u2014in that sense, it has to be part of our role , and\u2014but not the overall response of society to climate change.  That\u2019s not us.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And if I could follow up, can you clarify why the Fed hasn\u2019t signed on to the Network for Greening the Financial System  like 40 other central banks have?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we\u2019ve attended all of their meetings and taken part in them , and we\u2019ve been looking at joining in one form or another and talking to them about that .  We probably will do that at some point.  So that\u2019s \u2014that\u2019s  an ongoing question.  B ut we\u2019re  very much attending those meetings and taking part in them \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  So there was a signing of a ratified USMCA at the White House today.  M id-February, the phase- one China dea l gets \u2014goes into effect.  Have you seen business investment pick up at all?   If not, what will it take to get that business investment going as this uncertainty is\u2014is being cleared up?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  So I guess I\u2019d start by saying that the fact that we\u2019ve reached a phase -one deal with China and the fact that we\u2019ve moved ahead closer to getting USM[ C]A agreed \u2014those are potentially positive things for the economy without question.  W ithout question.  And financial markets \u2014the reaction of financial marke ts is very consistent with that perception.  A sustained reduction in uncertainty over time should improve business sentiment , investment, which would provide some additional support for the economy.  It\u2019s important, though, to bear in mind a couple of things.  First, trade policy uncertainty remains elevated.  Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk.  We still have two or even three active trade discussions that are going on in the public square right now.  So it hasn\u2019t gone away, and we\u2019ve just come through a round of talking to our vast network of comments \u2014sorry, contacts in the business world.  And I think, clearly , these are seen as positive developments going forward, but there\u2019s a bit of a wait -and-see attitude \u2014is this going to be   sustain ed?  The agreements have to be implemented, too, and that\u2019ll take quite some time.  So, I would say, we need to be a little bit patient about the effect on the economy.  There\u2019s also the global economy.  You could\u2014you could well see manufacturing\u2014as I mentioned, manufacturing PMIs have started to tick up consistently among both advanced economies and emerging market economies.

Do you have any greater sense of what \u2014what  was going wrong with the repo market starting in September?  There seem ed to be, you know \u2014whether it was a one -off event, you know, too tight around tax payments and debt settlement , or whether there\u2019s a more enduring issue going on with the market, more structural forces that are basically gumming up the repo sector \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes.  As for those forces, so , as we indicated , we would undertake a, you know, serious review of that question and look at both our regulations and also supervisory practices.  A nd we\u2019d be prepared to adjust those in ways that might encourage liquidity to flow more easily in the system as long as it didn \u2019t undermine safety and soundness.  And so we\u2019ve undertaken that , and w e\u2019ve done a ton of work, a ctually .  We don\u2019t have anything to announce here today , but I feel good about the \u2014what we\u2019ve learned there.  I think \u2014you mentioned other factors.  W e will be announcing our findings.  I\u2019m not going to give you a time, but we\u2019re \u2014we\u2019re  well along in that assessment at this time.  I think we also found out, though, that the level of reserves that we need in the system to conduct our operations without frequent reso rt to open market operations was higher than we had thought and was higher than others had thought, too.  We learned that we can\u2019t let reserves \u2014we   shouldn\u2019t let reserves go below $1\u00bd trillion \u2014roughly, the level of early September \u2014at any point.  And that me ans that reserves will move through in a range over the course of the year that will be substantially higher than $1\u00bd [trillion] , but they won\u2019t ever go below.  So $1\u00bd [trillion] is not a target level .  It is the bottom of a range in which reserves will be  expected to move\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Mr. Chairman .  I just wanted to ask about how your balance sheet operations and repo\u2014temporary repos \u2014how they affect the system and who they\u2019re helping.  Clearly, they\u2019re mostly designed, as you said, to get \u2014keep the fed funds rate in the range you\u2019re looking for.  But , certainly, the repo market is also used heavily by hedge funds and other Wall Street institutions .  And so, how would you explain to, sort of, Main Street  why you\u2019re doing all this for that market?  And how would you address criticism that it is helping mostly Wall Street, along with everything else?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, let me just stress that we have a very specific and important reason for ca ring about money market operations generally, and that just is that we are\u2014our monetary policy decisions are transmitted through the financial markets \u2014through the money markets into other financial markets and into broader financial conditions.  So we care  that money markets are operating smoothly.  A nd they stopped operating smoothly, briefly, back in September.  And so we acted.  This is a one -time thing that we\u2019re doing to adjust the level of reserves so that the money markets will be able to operate smo othly on an ongoing basis.  Repo markets are important , because that\u2019s where Treasury securities\u2014the purchase of Treasury securities, which is the way \u2014you know, the federal \u2014part  of the way the federal government is funding its operations.  It\u2019s the way thos e are financed.  So these are largely Treasury securities that have been purchased by dealers to \u2014for distribution to \u2014and buyers , to a substantial extent .  That\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the Treasury repo market.  So it\u2019s just the financing   for\u2014for that.  Now, a gain, we don\u2019t \u2014that activity is a \u2014is a market activity.  We\u2019re not looking to eliminate volatility or protect anybody from volatility at all.

Thank you, Chairman Powell.  I\u2019d like to turn your atte ntion back to China and the health of its financial sector in particular.  And I guess I\u2019m basing my question on reading the transcripts from 2014 that came out earlier this month.  Just \u2014in March of that year, there was concern about the Chinese economy, a nd one of your colleagues on the FOMC at that time asked the staff about how the Chinese economy would hurt \u2014hit the U.S. economy.  And the staffer said that there was a \u2014what they were worried about was that not only was the Chinese economy slowing down, but there was the financial sector .  And the quote was :  \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of dodgy loans in China.\u201d  Now, I was wondering if you could give us an update on these problems in the Chinese financial sector .  And how do you think it might impact the economy, particularly now that they\u2019ve been hit by this unexpected shock?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, China has had a problem for some years, including from that period\u20142014 up until, I guess, \u201917 or \u201918, a nd I thought \u2014which was essentially just a lot of debt for an emerging market .  For an economy at the \u2014at th e stage of evolution of the Chinese economy, they had very high levels of debt \u2014not sovereign debt the way we think of it , but more business debt \u2014debt  of state- owned enterprises and also just private businesses.  And a couple of years ago the authorities decided to try to get that under control \u2014to stop the growth and to control it.  And that \u2014as I mentioned, that\u2019s one of the reasons why Chinese growth slowed, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why global growth slowed, because we felt that.  And they\u2019ve actually stuck to that even during this difficult period when they were experiencing, you know, strains from trade negotiations and that kind of thing.  The authorities have stuck to that   and have, again, continued to t ry to do that , so\u2014to try to control the growth of debt .  And that\u2019s important that they do that.  We don\u2019t think that \u2014that there\u2019s any imminent risk there , although you\u2014as you point out, the coronavirus thing is a significant thing, which will \u2014will have some effects on the Chinese economy, at least in the short term.  The Chinese economy is very important in the global economy now.  And, you know, we \u2014when China\u2019s economy slows down, we do feel that\u2014not as much as countries, though, that are near Chi na or th at trade more actively with China, like some of the Western European countries.  We still have \u2014you know, 85 percent of our economy is domestic.  And we have a much smaller external sector, trade sector, than other economies just because of our phys ical location.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Brian Cheung here, Yahoo Fi nance.  So the combination of T-bill purchases and repo operations have been described colloquially as \u201c liquidity .\u201d  I\u2019m just wondering if you semantically agree with that description \u2014then, seco ndly, what the impact of that has been on risk assets.  I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something that , you know , the Board or Reserve Banks are formally looking into or just looking at what the effect of it has been.  H ow are you kind of thinking about that going forward?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, so , two questions.  I mean, in terms of liquidity, I think what we\u2019re doing is what I said :  We\u2019re trying to raise the level of reserves back up to a level so that banks can meet their reserve requirements, and that t here\u2019s enough reserves in the system that we don\u2019t see reserve scarcity , and we don\u2019t have to use repo operations to provide additional reserves.  So I think, as I mentioned, we believe we can get to that state at the current pace sometime in the second quarter.    In terms of effects on risk assets, as I said earlier, it\u2019s very hard to say what is affecting financial markets with any precision or confidence at a given time.  It\u2019s not our intention to change the stance of monetary policy.  These were designed to provide more reserves and, really , to do that in order to enable better transmission of our \u2014of our  rate decisions into the economy under our chosen framework.  That\u2019s really the purpose of what we\u2019re doing\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Jean Yung with MNI.  I wanted to ask about the framework review again.  Would a shift of focus to inflation over an average period\u2014would that call for a different policy stance if you made that shift?  And whether or not we know the answer to that question, would the Fed consider changing the stance of monetary policy for that reason even if there was no change to the economic outlook?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, as you know, we\u2019re comfortable with our current policy stance.  We think it\u2019s appropriate .  We think it\u2019ll remain appropriate as long as data coming in are broadly in keeping with our outlook.  Over time \u2014over time , though\u2014let me take a step back.  Over time, an average inflation -targeting framework would be different than our current framework , in the sense that it wouldn\u2019t be  a\u2014there would be some aspect of trying to make inflation average 2 percent over time, which means , if it runs below 2 percent for a time , it has to run above to bring the average  up.  So that is a different framework. Our current framework is one where we say \u2014or we\u2019d  be equally concern ed with deviations of inflation from target on either side.  But that isn\u2019t\u2014that doesn\u2019t suggest an intention specifically to have those deviations be symmetric.  In other words, that would\u2014consistent with  that would be having all the deviations be on one side, which is what we\u2019 ve had, actually.  So I think it is a change in framework, and over time it would lead to a different   approach to policy.  Again, I\u2019m not trying to\u2014I don\u2019t want to comment on the current stance of policy, whi ch we do think is appropriate.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Don Lee with the L.A. Times.   I wanted to ask you about the stock market.  By historical comparisons , as you know, valuations are considerably high.  And I just wonder how much discussion and concern you and your colleagues have about that and what risk s you see for the economy.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: S o we \u2014we look at a very broad range of financial conditions where \u2014there isn\u2019t any one financial condition that we \u2014that we  look at.  And when we look at financial conditions, wh at matters for the real economy is substantial changes in \u2014or, material changes in financial conditions that are sustained over a period of time.  If I can, maybe I\u2019ll \u2014maybe I\u2019ll  answer that in the context of our overall financial stability framework.  That\u2019 s one way to look at it.  So we look at \u2014when we look at financial stability, we look a t\u2014really, we\u2019ve got four pillars to that, t he first of which is leverage in the financial system that is at a comfortable level.  Our banks, particularly our  large banks, have high levels of capital.  The second is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that divides into households and businesses.  Households\u2019 debt to GDP is \u2014has been coming down since the financial crisis.  It\u2019s not moving up.  It\u2019s at low \u2014low  levels compared to what it was before the crisis.  So not every household\u2014 but, in the aggregate , household debt is in a good place, a very good place.  Business debt has been moving up.  We\u2019ve been calling that out for more than a year \u2014substantially more than a year, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re focused on.  A nd we\u2019ve taken appropriate measures and are monitoring carefully.  But we think it\u2019s not something that would threaten financial stability , but more be an amplifier.    The other one is asset purchases, gett ing to your \u2014sorry, asset prices, getting to your question.  We do see asset valuations as being somewhat elevated \u2014I do \u2014somewhat elevated .  If you look at risk spreads, they\u2019re narrow .  If you look at P /Es, they\u2019re high.  I think the way to think about \u2014a good way\u2014one way to think about equity prices , though, is , what\u2019s the premium you\u2019re getting paid to own equities rather than risk- free debt ?  And that\u2019s also at fairly low levels, but not extremely low levels.  So valuations are high, but not at extremes.  The final factor is funding risk .  Are  big financial institutions and other players in the financial system funded with stable funding, or is there a lot of run risk?  And the answer is , very stable funding, for the most part.  So if you look at , overall \u2014wh at you see , in my view , is, vulnerabilities to the financial\u2014to financial stability are moderate overall.  KATY O\u2019DONNELL.  Hi .

The law can both be more effective and more efficient is \u2014it comes down to.  A nd we think this is a good way.  It\u2019 s also just a good time to take on board the way the delivery of banking services has changed through technology and demographic change as well.  We worked very hard to try to get on the same page with the other two agencies.  We think that an interagency f inal rule together would be the best outcome.  We\u2019re sorry we haven\u2019t been able to get there , and we still hold out some hope that we will be able to.

And how much would you take their plight into consideration?  How much can you sympathize with them?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: .  Sure.  So we \u2014we  are assigned a job by Congress, and that is to use our tools t o pursue maximum employment and stable prices.  And that\u2019s what \u2014that\u2019s our focus.  Now, monetary policy is a blunt instrument, but it\u2019s a powerful one.  So I think if you look\u2014look at the time since the financial crisis.  T hat was \u2014in the week [wake] of  fairly modest growth, it was a powerful recovery in the labor market.  And part of that just is the effect of lower interest rates.  So, if \u2014so many, many people benefit from low interest rates.  In fact, you don\u2019t hear \u2014when you talk to the low - and modera te-income communities, one thing you don\u2019t   hear is, \u201cYou ought to raise rates. \u201d  That\u2019s not what you hear.  You hear quite the opposite, which is, you know, \u201cP lease do whatever you can to keep this expansion going.\u201d  I absolutely sympathize with people.  If  you\u2019re living on just the interest in a bank or on fixed -income generally, then that\u2019s a challenging thing.  On the other hand, if you own a home, home values \u2014the housing market has recovered, other financial assets have recovered, so \u2014but , yes, for some people who are limited to those sources plus whatever other help they get, it can be challenging.  I mean, we have to do what\u2019s best for the \u2014for the  overall society and the economy.  That\u2019s \u2014those are our orders from Congress.  Thanks very much.\n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 5, "dovish": 14, "neutral": 25}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 1, "dovish": 2, "neutral": 22}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 6, "dovish": 16, "neutral": 47}, "speech_summary": "At today's meeting, the FOMC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, aiming to achieve maximum employment and price stability. They believe that monetary policy is well positioned to support economic growth, a strong job market, and a return of inflation to their 2 percent goal, despite weak business investment, exports, and manufacturing output.Despite uncertainties caused by the new coronavirus, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects moderate economic growth to continue, supported by favorable monetary and financial conditions. The job market remains strong, with low unemployment rates, solid job gains, and rising wages, but the FOMC acknowledges the need to sustain the expansion to ensure that more individuals benefit from the strong job market. Inflation, however, continues to run below the FOMC's 2 percent objective.The available data suggests that inflation will remain similar in December, but it is expected to gradually increase to 2 percent in the coming months. However, if inflation continues to persistently stay below our objective, it could lead to lower interest rates and limit our ability to support the economy in the future.The FOMC has successfully implemented their plan to purchase Treasury bills and conduct repo operations, resulting in stability in the federal funds rate and money market conditions. As they continue to build reserves, they plan to gradually transition away from active repo operations and slow the pace of purchases, maintaining an ample level of reserves without the use of repos.The technical measures implemented are meant to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy and do not indicate a change in policy stance. The transition to the longer-run ample-reserves regime will be carried out smoothly and predictably, with ongoing monitoring and adjustments as necessary.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Can you explain the change in language regarding the Committee's inflation objective and what it signifies?\n'ANSWER': The change in language was made to avoid misinterpretation. The previous language could have been seen as accepting inflation below 2 percent. The new language emphasizes the Committee's commitment to not view 2 percent as a ceiling and their dissatisfaction with inflation below 2 percent, especially during a period of low unemployment.", "'QUESTION': How many reserves are considered \"ample\" and how does the Fed determine the necessary quantity of reserves for policy implementation?\n'ANSWER': The Fed aims to have reserves at a level no lower than they were in early September, around $1.5 trillion, as the bottom end of the range. Reserves will fluctuate and be substantially higher most of the time. The Fed will gradually reduce asset purchases and repo operations as reserves reach the ample level, while ensuring interest rates remain within the target range.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that the market is treating the expansion of the balance sheet as a QE program and that it may lead to a \"taper tantrum\"?\n'ANSWER': Our intention is to raise the level of reserves and conduct monetary policy efficiently. We expect to reach the desired reserve level in the second quarter and gradually reduce purchases and repo as we satisfy demand from underlying reserves. We are prepared to adjust the plan based on conditions.", "QUESTION: Can you discuss the recent moderation in wages and whether there are any concerns about cracks in the labor market?\n\nANSWER: The labor market remains strong with strong job creation, low unemployment, and increasing labor force participation. Wage growth has increased from around 2% to around 3%, which is theoretically where it should be at full employment. The lower-than-expected wage growth could be due to a lower natural rate of unemployment or the surprise increase in labor force participation, which is a positive development but may be holding down wages.", "'QUESTION': Is it fair to say that the Federal Reserve is considering inflation-target averaging and allowing inflation to run above the 2 percent target for some time? What is Chairman Powell's personal opinion on this idea? When can we expect the results of the review?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve conducted a review to incorporate the \"new normal\" into its policy framework, which includes global disinflationary trends, a flat Phillips curve, and a lower neutral real interest rate. The review aims to ensure that the Fed's strategy, tools, and communications are best suited to achieve its goals in the current environment. The review is ongoing, and the results will be announced around the middle of the year. Chairman Powell did not provide his personal preferences at this time.", "'QUESTION': Are you worried about the impact of the coronavirus on the U.S. economy and do you see it as a significant risk to the outlook?\n'ANSWER': The coronavirus is a serious issue and there may be disruption to activity in China and possibly globally. It is uncertain how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be. We are monitoring the situation and considering the potential ramifications for the U.S. economy. There are signs of cautious optimism for the global economy, but the coronavirus adds uncertainty to the outlook.", "QUESTION: How high does the Federal Reserve want to get interest on excess reserves (IOER) as the fed funds rate moves to the middle of the band?\n\nANSWER: The goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well within the range. Last year, there was tightness as reserves were draining out of the system, causing the rate to gradually move up. With ample reserves, it's possible to bring the interest on reserves rate up to 10 basis points, which puts them well within the range.", "QUESTION: So you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that, as the fed funds goes back up towards the center of the range, that IOER is going to end up at the top?\nANSWER: We want the IOER to be well within the range and will adjust it as necessary. The goal is to deliver a federal funds rate that is well within the range. The IOER is just a tool to achieve that and we will make changes to keep it within the range. Ultimately, what matters is keeping the federal funds rate in check.", "'QUESTION': Did you hear the question okay?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell acknowledges hearing the question, but expresses uncertainty if his colleagues heard it as well, leading to laughter among the reporters.", "QUESTION: Where do the discussions stand on standing repo and Treasury bill purchases in the new regime?\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve has not made a decision on a standing repo facility and the preannouncement of Treasury bill purchases. They will make decisions as early and transparently as possible, but it is still several months away. The Fed is still gathering information and assessing the usefulness, costs, and benefits of a standing repo facility. They are not in a rush to make a decision and are focused on achieving a stable equilibrium in an ample-reserves regime.", "'QUESTION': Do you think there is a systemwide financial stability risk from climate change?\n'ANSWER': Over the longer term, it is possible. While climate change is an important issue, it is primarily the responsibility of other agencies and elected officials. However, the Fed has a supervisory mandate to ensure the financial system is resilient against climate change risks, and there is ongoing work to understand and address this issue.", "'QUESTION': Can you clarify why the Fed hasn't signed on to the Network for Greening the Financial System like other central banks?\n'ANSWER': We have attended their meetings, participated in them, and have been considering joining in some capacity. We will likely do so in the future. We are actively involved in these discussions and meetings.", "QUESTION: Have you seen business investment pick up with the signing of the USMCA and the phase-one China deal?\nANSWER: The phase-one deal with China and the USMCA agreement are potentially positive for the economy, as reflected in financial market reactions. However, trade policy uncertainty remains elevated, and it will take time for the agreements to be implemented. We need to be patient and consider the global economy, but positive developments and accommodative financial conditions could spur further growth.", "'QUESTION': Do you have any greater sense of what was going wrong with the repo market starting in September? Is it a one-off event or a more enduring issue?\n'ANSWER': We have undertaken a serious review of the repo market and are looking at regulations and supervisory practices. We have learned that the level of reserves needed in the system is higher than expected and should not go below $1\u00c2\u00bd trillion. Reserves will be expected to move within a range above this level.", "QUESTION: How do the balance sheet operations and repo market affect the system and who do they benefit?\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve cares about money market operations because they transmit monetary policy decisions and affect broader financial conditions. The Fed intervened in the repo market to ensure smooth operations and adjust reserves. The repo market is important for financing Treasury securities, which are purchased by dealers for distribution. The Fed's concern is the impact of repo market volatility on the transmission of policy decisions to the federal funds rate.", "'QUESTION': Is the Fed going to vote on changes to the Volcker rule restrictions on banks investing in venture capital funds?\n'ANSWER': Yes, the Fed will be voting on proposed revisions to the covered fund provisions of the Volcker rule. These revisions aim to be faithful to the law and will be put out for public discussion and comments. The proposals will be made public during the Board meeting tomorrow.", "'QUESTION': Is the change in rules for venture capital funds only, or does it also apply to hedge funds and private equity funds?\n'ANSWER': The change in rules applies to covered funds, which includes venture capital funds, hedge funds, and private equity funds. It does not affect the proprietary trading part of the Volcker rule.", "'QUESTION': Is there a chance that banks could get involved in risky investments like mortgage-backed securities again?\n'ANSWER': We believe that our actions are in line with safety and soundness and comply with the Volcker rule. We will consider feedback from stakeholders and thoroughly examine this question, along with others.", "QUESTION: Can you provide an update on the problems in the Chinese financial sector and how it might impact the economy, considering the recent shock of the coronavirus?\n\nANSWER: China has had high levels of debt in its financial sector for years, which has slowed down its growth and had a global impact. The authorities have been trying to control the growth of debt, even during the coronavirus crisis. While there may be short-term effects on the Chinese economy, we don't see any imminent risk.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree with the colloquial description of T-bill purchases and repo operations as \"liquidity\" and what has been the impact on risk assets?\n'ANSWER': We are trying to raise the level of reserves to meet banks' requirements and avoid reserve scarcity. We believe we can achieve this by the second quarter. It is difficult to determine the precise impact on financial markets. Our intention is not to change monetary policy, but rather to improve the transmission of rate decisions into the economy.", "QUESTION: Would a shift to an average inflation-targeting framework call for a different policy stance and would the Fed consider changing monetary policy even if there was no change to the economic outlook?\n\nANSWER: Over time, an average inflation-targeting framework would be different from the current framework. It would aim to make inflation average 2 percent over time, meaning if it runs below 2 percent, it has to run above to bring the average up. This would lead to a different approach to policy, but the current policy stance is considered appropriate.", "'QUESTION': How much discussion and concern do you and your colleagues have about the high valuations in the stock market and what risks do you see for the economy?\n'ANSWER': We look at a broad range of financial conditions and focus on substantial and sustained changes. We have four pillars for financial stability: leverage in the financial system, leverage in the nonfinancial sector, asset prices, and funding risk. While asset valuations are somewhat elevated, vulnerabilities to financial stability are moderate overall. As for the Community Reinvestment Act reform, it is Governor Brainard's vision and the Fed may propose it in the future.", "'QUESTION': Do you support Governor Brainard's vision for the Community Reinvestment Act reform and will the Fed formally propose it?\n'ANSWER': Updating the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is seen as a win-win for low- and moderate-income communities and banks seeking more certainty. The Fed has been working to align with other agencies for an interagency final rule, but no decisions have been made on proposing reforms or commenting on other proposals.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree with Vice Chair Quarles's approach to bank supervision and are there plans to codify his suggestions later in the year?\n'ANSWER': I agree with the principles of firm and fair supervision and effective transparency in communications that Vice Chair Quarles articulated. It would be beneficial to have clearer lines defining our LISCC supervisory portfolio. The speech raised interesting questions about balancing transparency and due process with confidential supervision, which requires further thought. The specific proposals are interesting but need further development and input.", "'QUESTION': What would you say to individuals who have seen the Fed cutting rates, eroding their ability to get a higher return on their savings? How much can you sympathize with them?\n'ANSWER': We are assigned a job by Congress to pursue maximum employment and stable prices. Monetary policy is a powerful but blunt instrument. Many people benefit from low interest rates, and we hear from low- and moderate-income communities that they want us to do whatever we can to keep the expansion going. While I sympathize with those relying on fixed-income, we have to do what's best for the overall society and economy."]}
