You have, I think a couple times in your opening remarks talked about this language in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on the way? And should we also believe that all f uture meetings, say September and November, are live or are you in a every other meeting mode? Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we haven't made a decision to go to every other meeting. It's not something we've looked at. We're going to be going meeting by mee ting, and as we go into each meeting, we're going to be asking ourselves the same questions. So we haven't made any decisions about any future meetings, including the pace at which we'd consider hiking. But we're going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate. You read the language, to return inflation to 2 percent over time. I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations, economic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while  cooling a bit. And the June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change. And the June CPI report of course was welcomed but it's only one report, one month's data. We hope that inflation will follow a lower path as was, that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we don't know that and we're just going to need to see more data. So what are we going to be looking at? Really it will be the broader, the whole broader picture, and starting with, we're looking for moderate grow th, right? We're looking for supply and demand through the economy coming into better balance. Including in particular , the labor market. We'll be looking at inflation, we'll be asking ourselves; does this whole collection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further? And if we make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates. So that's how we're thinking about the next meeting. And you know, how we're thinking about meetings going forward potentially, but we're now mainly thinking    about the next meeting. I will also say, since we're talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we get two more job reports, two more CPI reports, I think we have an ECI report coming later this week, which is employment compe nsation index, and lots of data on economic activity. All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting. I would say it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting, if the data warranted, and I would also say it's possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting. We're going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting and I'll close by saying; we've raised the f ederal  funds r ate now by 525 basis points since March 2022, monetary policy we believe is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could just briefly follow -up on something you said there. You said the data in the inter meeting period, it pro bably came in line with expectations. Does that mean there's not likely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the Committee that two more hikes are necessary?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I'm just going to go back to what I said. We, you know, that's the  question. We have eight weeks now until the September meeting and all that data that I recited, we're going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then. And it really, we did have the one good reading and of course we welcome that, but it's just one reading, as everybody knows, and you know, we've seen, we've seen this before in the data. Many forecasts call for rates, for inflation to remain low, but we just don't know that until we see the data. So we'll be focusing on that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. Obviously, you updated the language around growth in the statement today, you know, we've seen the Barbie movie numbers, we've seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concer ts this summer. It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape and it does seem like growth is sort of picking back up a little bit, or at least doing well. And I wonder from your perspective if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know, performing well this summer, is that a problem because it's inflationary or is it good news because it suggests that a soft landing is more likely? Just how are you thinking about that sort of trajectory?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yeah, so I would say it this way; the overall resilience of the economy, the fact that we've been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact o n the labor market, the strength of the economy overall, that's a good thing. It's good to see that, of course. It's also you see consumer confidence coming up and things like that, that will support activity going forward. But you're right though, at the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation and that would requir e an appropriate response for monetary policy. So we'll be watching that carefully and seeing how it evolves over time.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. So as you referenced earlier, near meeting period, sof t CPI, jobs reports still strong but moderating [inaudible] good. So if you're data dependent, why not pause again? Why not stay on hold? Why not take another meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the direction you want to see?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, if you go back to what we're trying to do here, we're trying to achieve a stance of policy that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent. At the last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimates of that, of what that would take, and the meaning of that was an additional two rate hikes. So, I would say we looked at the intermeeting data and as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent but broadly consistent with expectations and as a result, we went ahead and too k another step. And that's, you know, a labor market that continues to be strong but gradually slowing. I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but you know, we're going to be careful about taking too much signal f rom a single reading. And you know, growth came in stronger than expected. So that's how we look at it, and so we did take that step today.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, markets widely beli eve the median FOMC participants' inflation forecast from June, from the 4th quarter of this year, will be too high given autos and shelter. That by September that may warrant a downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20- 30 basis points. Would that type of inflation progress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below trend growth and decelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you've done enough?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So it's hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of this and how much of that, you know, we'll be looking at everything. And you know, we'll, of course we'll be looking to see whether the signal from June's CPI is replicated or the opposite of replicated or whether it's somewhere in the mid dle. We'll be looking at the growth data, we'll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall judgment about    that. It's the totality of the data, I think. But with a particular focus on making progress on inflation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I can follow -up up, last month you said there were benefits to moderating the pace of increases because it would give you more information to make decisions. Would another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to at least m aintain that slower pace and defer until the F all, any decision on whether you need that second rate hike?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, I'm just going to tell you again what we're going to do in September, we're going to look at two additional job reports, two addi tional CPI reports, lots of activity data, and that's what we're going to look at and we're going to make that decision then. And that decision could mean another hike in September, or it could mean that we decide to maintain at that level and again, the q uestion we're going to be asking ourselves is, is the overall signal one that we need to do more? That we need to tighten further. And if we get that signal, whenever we get it, then, and that's the collective judgment of the Committee, then we will move ahead. If we don't, you know, then we'll have the option of maintaining policy at that level, but it's you know, it's really dependent so much on the data and we just don't have it yet.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chris Rugaber, Associated  Press. So, consumer confidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part because of the declines in headline inflation, you also see wages are also rising faster than prices now, after trailing them for a long them. How much are Americans truly harme d by inflation at its current level, headline level of 3 percent, and with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side of the dual mandate?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, I guess I'd say it this way. First, it is a good thing that headline inflation has come down so much, because that's really what the public experience is, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a, it will strengthen the broad sense that the public has that inflation is coming down, w hich will in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down. So you are really, sorry, your question was?\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Well, you've talked for many press conferences now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people. So how much of  that are we still seeing with inflation now down at three?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I guess I would put it this way, we -- I'd say it this way; it's really a question of how do you balance the two risks; the risk of doing too much or doing too little, and you know, I would say that you know, we're coming to a place where there really are risks on both sides. It's hard to say exactly whether they're in balance or not, but as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do increasingly face th at risk. But you know, we need to see that inflation is durably down that far, you know, as you know, we think and most economists think that core inflation is actually a better signal of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is aff ected greatly by volatile energy and food prices, so we would want core inflation to be coming down because that's what we think, that's, core is signaling where headline's going to go in the future. And core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know? T here's reason to think it can come down now, but it's still quite elevated and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we're going to need to hold, certainly hold policy at restrictive levels for some time. And we need to be prepared to raise fur ther if we think that's appropriate.   \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Well, and then if inflation were to -- just a quick follow -- if it stays at three or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that l ast bit of inflation? People are talking about the potential difficulty of the last, so -called last mile of inflation. So, how much, again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, it is a very positive thin g that, actually the unemployment rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of '22, at 3.6 percent, so that's a real blessing in that we've been able to achieve some disinflation and we don't seek to it, it's not that we're aiming to raise une mployment, but I would just say the historical record, we have to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market conditions. And so that is still the likely outcome here. And you know, we hope that that's as little as possible. We have to be honest, that that is the likely outcome. The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not get it done, whatever the short -term social cost of getting inflation under control, the longer -term social costs of failing to do so are greater and the historical record is very, very clear on that. If you go through a period where inflation expectations  are not anchored, inflation is volatile, it interferes with people's lives and with economic activity and you know, that's the thing we really need to avoid and will avoid.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: At this point you say the policy is restrictive but all year long we have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation lately, to the downside. So I'm wondering by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now under these conditions, do you think you might need to do more because I'm curious about what you    see as inflation dynamics now. Is the economy still moving in a direction where it creates more inflation? People talk about base effects and higher energy costs, and now we have some large labor settlements. Or, is the economy disinflating and you're just, you're able to go back to the old F ed policy of opportunistic disinflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, I'll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is we want to see easing of sup ply constraints and normalization of pandemic related distortions to demand and supply, we want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to help ease inflationary pressures, we want to see continued restoration of supply and demand balan ce, particularly in the labor market, and all of that should lead to declining inflationary pressures. What we see is we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together and we're seeing evidence of those things now, but I would say that what our eyes are te lling us is that policy has not been restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects. So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we're confident that inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we're pre pared to further tighten if that is appropriate. And we think the process, you know, still probably has a long way to go.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Well do you think under current conditions you are restrictive enough unless something changes?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, I think, we think you know, today's rate hike was appropriate and I think we're going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our dec ision at the next meeting about is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more and if it does tell us that, collectively if that's our view, then we will do more.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Colby Smith with the Financial Ti mes. If September is in fact a live meeting, how does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace that you spoke of last month in explaining the rationale for holding the f unds rate steady at the June meeting?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, a more gradual pace doesn't go immediately to every other meeting. It could be two out of three meetings, right? It could be, it just means if you're slowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as we get closer and closer to we think our destination. And I wouldn't want to go automatically to every other meeting because I just don't think that's, we don't, I think it's not an environment where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance, there's a lot of uncertaint y out there, we just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so that's what we did. And so, I think it's possible, I mentioned before it's possible that we would move at consecutive meetings, we're not taking that off the table, or we might not. It's really going to depend on what the data tell us. That's the best we can do.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: So we shouldn't assume that every other meeting is the lowest tightening frequency let's say. It could be you know, longer intervals in between as well.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I think we're, look, I think we're going to make a decision about the next meeting and then we're going to make a decision about the one after that. And I think it'll sort itself out.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: hanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. So, among your colleagues, there have been people who have said they feel that very little transmission has taken place so far from monetary policy into the economy and there are those who feel, they say, it's happened very fast this time and it's kind of up to date. Where are you on that continuum?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, there's a long running debate about the lags betwe en changes in financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation, right? So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move the anticipation of our decisions and that has clearly been the case in this cycl e. So in a sense, the clock starts earlier than it used to. But that doesn't necessarily change the process and from that point on and it's not clear that it has. We also, this is-- I'll tell you what we know and then what we don't know. We know that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and variable, or lags plural, that can be long and variable. A lot of uncertainty around the length of the lags and by the way, that's just one component of the broader unce rtainty that we face. So, I'll tell you how I think about this, first, the first thing to say is, we're determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time and we will use our tools to do that, no one should doubt that. I would look at it this way th ough, the real f ederal funds r ate is now in meaningfully positive territory. If you take the nominal federal f unds r ate, subtract the mainstream estimate of near term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds r ate that is well above most estimat es of the longer term neutral rate. So I would say monetary policy is restrictive, more so after today's decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. We'll keep monetary policy restricted until we think it's no t appropriate to do so. So that's how I think about it. I mean if I sum it up, I would say; we've come a long way, we are resolutely committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time. Inflation has proved,    repeatedly has proved stronger than we and other forecasters have expected and at some point that may change. We have to be ready to follow the data and given how far we've come, we can afford to be a little patient as well as resolute as we let this unfold.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: On the credi t side, I'm wondering if you saw anything in the latest SLOOS data that made you think you're getting a quantum of credit contraction beyond what you'd expect? The bank lending data really is, the growth rate's edging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually you know, a recession indicator.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I guess the SLOOS will come our early next week and I would just say it's broadly consistent with what you would expect. You've got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter , you've got weak demand, and you know, it gives a picture of a pretty tight credit conditions in the economy. I think it's really hard to tease out whether how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is the overall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions. And that's what the SLOOS will say.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: i Chair Powell, Rachel Sieg el from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what share of that credit you would give to factors that don't stem directly from rate hikes or that might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yeah.  So, interesting question. So, let me start by saying that the inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and    the response from fiscal and monetary policy. And we've always expected that the disinflationary process would stem from both from the normalization of those broad pandemic related supply and demand conditions, and from restrictive monetary policy which would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand. And we think that's broadly what we're seeing. So to go break it down a little further, of course headline inflation has come down sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to reversal of the effects from the war in Ukraine, and that's a good thing and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier. For core inflation, I'd say there also, there has been a role for most, for both factors, both  that I mentioned. Clearly for goods, normalization supply conditions is playing an important role as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal of spending back into services and away from goods. And take autos as an example, the combination of an inc rease in sales and inventories, while vehicle inflation is decelerated, points to a substantial role for supply, but there's also a role for demand as you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive, so they're both working there. Housing servi ces inflation now starts to move down, clearly higher rates have slowed the housing market. You know, I would say monetary policy is working about as we expect, and we think it'll play an important role going forward, in particular in non-housing services where really, we think that's where the labor market will come in as a very important factor. So we think both of those sources of disinflation are playing an important role.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: I see, and just to follow -up up, do you think that of those two sources, the core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes or is there a more even split there too?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward, because we, we're sort of reaping now the benefits of the r eversal of some of the very specific    Pandemic things. We're seeing that with goods in particular. Supply chains and shortages moving and we're seeing, so I think going forward, monetary policy will be important, particularly in that, in the sector, in the non-housing services sector.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chair Powell. First, let me compliment your tie, the choice of tie, it's a good color. So, thanks for taking our questions. So the Beige Book, it said input cost pressures  remain elevated for services firms but eased notably from manufacturing sectors. Is that an indication that there's a wage inflation pressure? And how do you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into recession?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well I think the, as it relates to goods, it's really an indication that supply chains and shortages are easing. And so what was the first part of it?\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: So, wage inflation. Like how do you target wage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I don't think we're targeting wage inflation. I think what we're looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions. And that's what we're seeing. So, wages have actually been gradually moving down, they're still at  levels what would, that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation. Nonetheless, we're making progress there. And by so many indicators, labor market demand is cooling. You can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see  that, you can look at the quits rate normalizing, you can look at job openings coming down. You can look at just job creation in the establishment survey has you know, it's still at a high level, but it was at a really extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years. So, you see cooling, particularly in private sector in the last, you    know, in the last report. So, I think we see that, and it's happening at a gradual pace. So, that's actually not a bad thing, in a sense, because if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is really the engine of the economy, people are getting hired, many people going back to work, getting wages, spending money, and that's really what's driving the economy. But that is gradually slowing, it's gradually cooling, that's a good prescription for getting where we want to get.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: But still we see a push to raise minimum wage, we're seeing a lot of unions go on strike or threaten strike, and the common thing is they come out with agreements like big pay increases, like UPS and we have the auto workers coming up. Are you concerned about a trend of series of big unions, these contract pushing wage inflation then?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Not for us to comment on contract negotiations. Not our j ob, not our role. You know, we monitor  things and we'll keep an eye on them, but really, that's something that's handled at that level and not -- [ Inaudible ]\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: i, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask abo ut the S EP which suggests that you would cut rates as overall and core PCE get to around or under 3 percent. And so I'm wondering is the level of inflation what's sort of important there as you think about getting to 2 percent  and when you might start cutt ing rates, or is the speed at which inflation is falling also important?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  think you take both into account. I think you take everything into account when you start cutting rates. It would depend on the whole, on a wide range of things.    And when people rain down rate cuts next year, you know, it just is a sense that inflation i s coming down and we're comfortable that it's coming down and it's time to start cutting rates. I think, but I mean there's a lot of uncertainty between what happens you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year. Let alone the year after tha t.

I'm saying we would, we'd be comfortable cutting rates when we're comfortable cutting rates, and that won't be this year I don't think, it would be, you know, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year.

STEVE MA TTHEWS. A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the Fed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing and they've reduced their forecast for recession. And I'm wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of recession being likely and if you personally have changed your view in terms of becom ing more confident that you can achieve a soft landing.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: o, it has been my view consistently, that we do have a shot, and my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we've seen in    some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours. That's been my view, that's still my view. And I think you know, that's sort of consistent with what I see today. So, but it's a long way from assured and you know, we have a lot left to go to see that happen. So, the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, t hey are no longer forecasting a recession. It's, I just want to note that it's, that our staff produces its own forecast which is independent of the forecast that we as FOMC participants produce, having an independent staff forecast as well as the individu al participant forecast is really a strength of our process. There's just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that helps us make, help informs our deliberations, helps us make I hope better decisions.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: nd is the reason for  optimism that inflation has come down and you still have a strong labor market? I mean does that add to the optimism?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  wouldn't use the term optimism about this yet. I would say though that there's a pathway and yes, that's a good way to t hink about it. We've seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market. And that's a really good thing. I would just also say the historical records suggest that there's very likely to be some softening in labor market c onditions and consistent with having a soft landing, you would have some softening in the labor market conditions, and that's still likely as we, as we go forward with this process. But it's a good thing to date that we haven't really seen that. We've seen  softening through other, not through unemployment, not through higher unemployment, we've seen softening through you know, job openings coming down part of the way back to more normal levels. The quits rate, so people are not quitting as much, we've seen participation, people coming in and so labor supply has improved, which has lowered the temperature in the labor    market, which was quite overheated you know, going back a year or so. So we're seeing that kind of cooling and that's very healthy and you know , we hope it continues.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: hank you Mr. Chairman. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. You and other Fed  officials in the past have suggested that you don't need to keep hiking until inflation hits 2 percent, that as long as you see cont inued progress. So I'm wondering how close do you need to get with the inflation numbers coming down, how many months of data do you need to see that will give you sufficient confidence and how far does this fight need to go before you're willing to kind of declare victory on it?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: o the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to 2 percent, it would be a prescription of going way past the target. That's clearly not the appropriate way to think about it. So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we, the median participant, and again, these are forecast out years, so take them with a grain of salt. But people are cutting rates next year because you know, the Fed eral Funds Rate is at a restrictive level now. So, if we see inflation  coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don't need to be at a restrictive level anymore, we can you know, we can move back to a neutral level and then below a neutral level at a certain point. I think we would, you know, we would, we of course would be  very careful about that, we'd really want to be sure that inflation is coming down in a sustainable level. And it's hard to make, I'm not going to try to make a numerical assessment of when and where that would be. But that's the way I would think about i t, is you'd start, you'd stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation and you'd start cutting before you got to 2 percent inflation too, because we don't see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation until, you know, all the way back to 2, until 2025 or so, so.   \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: hank you Chair Powell, Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance. It's been over four months since a handful  of regional banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, failed. When you look at credit c onditions now, given Bank of California's acquisition of PacWest, does this acquisition suggest the full impact has not been felt or are you comfortable saying that we've seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this point and how does thi s play into your outlook for policy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: o I don't want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I will say things have settled down for sure out there. Deposit flows have stabilized, capital and liquidity remain strong. Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter, and is up significantly year over year. Banking sector  profits, generally are coming in strong this quarter and overall the banking system remains strong and resilient. Of course we're still watching you know, the situation carefully, and monitoring you know, monitoring conditions in the banking sector. In terms of the actual effect on, if you think of a particular set of banks that were affected because of their size and business model and things like that, they were more affected by the turmoil in March than others. It's very hard, as I mentioned, it's very hard to sort of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours, from them tightening. They may be tightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks. The SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year, that banking conditions are tightening. That process is ongoing and that will restrain economic growth. So, I think we have to take a step back from, I can't separate those anymore. I think basically we're just looking at the overall picture. Which is one of tightening credit conditions. And that's going to restrain economic activity, is restraining economic activity. So, that's how I would look at it.   \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: nd how is that infor ming your outlook for setting policy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: o I think we, that goes, that is an expected result of tightening interest rate policy is that is the bank credit conditions would, bank lending conditions would tighten as well. And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened in May? I just don't think we know that. I think we're looking at the current data and GDP and we're seeing strong spending. We're seeing a strong economy, and it's made us confident that we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events. And I, it seems like the economy is weathering this well, but of course we're watching it carefully and expect to continue to do that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: i C hair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Megan Cassella with Barron's. I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any of the inflationary impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer sentim ent and the continued strength of the consumer that we've been seeing.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: ell, wages in excess of inflation means real wages are positive again, that's a great thing. Of course we want that, we want people to have real wages, but we want wages to be going up at a level that's consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. As I mentioned, nominal wages have been coming down gradually, and that's what we want to see, we expect to see more of that. That's just more of what's consistent over a long er period of time. We don't really think that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak. But I would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward. Labor    market conditions broadly are going to be an i mportant part of getting inflation back down and that's why we think we need some further softening in labor market conditions.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: his goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you mentioned at the start how you're keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might be some sort of a rebound there, and I'm curious what the Fed 's explanation would be to families if further interest rate hikes start to hit, the labor market start to you know, drive that sentiment back down. What 's the message there of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise them?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: ell, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get inflation under control. And we think the single most important thing we can do to benefit thos e very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability. We think that is the most important thing we can do now and we're determined to do that. And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away are people who are on a low fixed income, who you know, when you're talking about travel or, you know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those, if you're just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you're in trouble right away. Even middle class people have some resources and can absorb inflation, people, the people on the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder tim e doing that. So, we need to get this done and you know, the record is clear that if we take too long or if we don't succeed that the pain will only be greater. So, that's how I would explain what we're doing.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: ha nk you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovich with The Economist. You had said last month that this meeting this week was going to be a live one. In the event the market had assigned a, you know, roughly 99 percent probability to the rate move that you announced today. The decision was of course unanimous, and the statement was basically unchanged from last month. So may I ask, you know, to what extent was the meeting actually a live one? Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision was actually going to be?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: ell I mean you could-- was there doubt? Look, I would say there's a range of views on the Committee and when you see the minutes in three weeks you'll see that. There's a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should do at the next meeting, and it\u2019s  a process that we go through. Many times when we go into a meeting, the decision is not you know, fundamentally in doubt. Nonetheless, we have the meeting and some meetings are you know, less unce rtain than others and I'll just leave it at that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Evan Ryser, Market News International. Thank you Chair Powell. Financial conditions have been loosening at a fairly steady clip in recent weeks, the dollar, the stock mark et, et cetera. What does that mean for the Fed  and being sure that inflation will come down to target?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: o, we monitor of course financial conditions, broad financial conditions. You're right, it's the dollar and equities, but and you know, w e're of course very focused on rates and our own policy. You know, we will, we're going to use our policy tools to working through financial conditions to get inflation under control. The implication is you know,    we will do what it takes to get inflation d own and in principle, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser we have to do more. But what tends to happen though is financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we're doing, and ultimately over time we get where we need to go.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: f I could also ask about the S EP from June that showed rate cuts. Do you expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year, while also continuing QT?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: o that could happen. The question is, you know, is that consistent with-- so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it's a world where things are okay and it's time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more normal lev els. Normalization in the case of the balance sheet would be to reduce QT so, or to continue it depending on where you are in the cycle. So they are two independent things and you know, really the active tool of monetary policy is rates. But you can imagin e circumstances in which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be different ways. But that wouldn't be the case.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: hanks Chair Powell, Kyle Campbell with American Banker. I have a question about the discount window. I'm wondering if since the bank failures of the spring, if you've seen signs of banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that they're ready to use that facility if they need to and if you have any sort of thoughts on whether policies might be appropriate for making sure the banks sort of test regularly to show that they are prepared to use it? Thanks.   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: o that's a very important thing, yes, and yes to both sides of that, you know. Yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window and we are strongly encouraging them to do that. Banks broadly. We did find, as you know, during the events of March and that you know, that it's a little clunkier, or it can be a l ittle clunkier and not as quick as it needs to be sometimes. So, why not be in a situation where you're just much more ready in case you need to access the discount window.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: r. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. You've talked in the past about getting the housing market back into better balance, excuse me, and also that the market might have bottomed. Where do you see that situation and balance, or lack thereof, right now particularly with the res trained, constrained inventory of existing homes that might otherwise be coming onto market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move and also all that happening with the 30 -year fixed rate mortgage still around 7 percent on the heels of Fed tightening and with what you're talking about tightening industry lending standards. Are we getting closer to balance or farther away? What's your sense?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  think we've got a ways to go to get back to balance. Really for the reasons that you talked about. With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have low rate mortgages and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they're not going to because they have so much value in their mortgage, which means that supply of ex isting homes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up. On the other hand, there's you know, there's a lot of supply coming online now and there are people coming into a lot of the buyers are, you know, first -time buyers coming in, buying at you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates. But I think this will take some time to work through,    hopefully more supply comes online and you know, we work through it. We're still living through the you know, the aftermath of the pandemic.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER. Hi Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall -Genzer  with Marketplace. Russia has pulled out of an agreement allowing shipments of grains, safe passage through the Black Sea and alternative routes at this point could be closed off. Just wondering how could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally and how closely are you watching that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: e are watching it, of course, very closely. And you're right, the withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative does raise concerns about global food security, particularly for poorer count ries that import a large share of their food. Grain prices did go up on this news but they remain well- below their peaks of last spring. And the moves that we've seen so far, I would say are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation.

They have tightened monetary policy and raised interest rates, with further policy firming dependent on data.Recent economic indicators suggest that while economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace, growth in consumer spending has slowed and activity in the housing sector remains below last year's levels due to higher mortgage rates. Additionally, higher interest rates and slower output growth are impacting business fixed investment. However, the labor market remains tight with strong job gains and a low unemployment rate, indicating signs of better balance between labor supply and demand.Nominal wage growth has eased and job vacancies have declined this year, while labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation remains above the 2 percent goal, with total PCE prices rising 3.8 percent and core PCE prices rising 4.6 percent. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored, and the Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by their mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices.The FOMC is aware of the negative impact of high inflation on purchasing power, especially for those with limited resources, and is committed to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objective. They have raised the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point and are reducing their securities holdings, but it will take time for the full effects of these actions to be realized, especially on inflation.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains committed to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent goal and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. This may require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions, but it is essential for restoring price stability and achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The FOMC understands that its actions have an impact on communities, families, and businesses across the country, and everything it does is in service to its public mission. The Fed will do everything it can to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.", "question_answer_summary": ["QUESTION: Should we expect additional rate hikes in the future meetings and are all future meetings live?\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve has not made a decision on the frequency of future meetings or the pace of rate hikes. They will assess the need for further tightening based on data, including inflation and economic activity. The possibility of raising rates at the September meeting exists, but a decision will be made based on careful assessments.", "'QUESTION': Does the data in the intermeeting period suggest that there will be no change in the Committee's outlook of two more rate hikes?\n'ANSWER': We will assess all the data in the next eight weeks before the September meeting. While we had one positive reading, we need to see more data to determine if inflation will remain low as forecasted.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve view the current growth in the economy and its potential impact on inflation?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve acknowledges the positive signs of growth in the economy and the resilience it has shown so far. While this is a good thing, stronger growth could eventually lead to higher inflation, which would require a response from monetary policy. The Fed will closely monitor the situation as it evolves.", "'QUESTION': Why not pause again and stay on hold if the data is moving in the desired direction?\n'ANSWER': We are aiming for a policy stance that will bring inflation down to 2 percent. Based on our analysis, we determined that two more rate hikes are needed. The intermeeting data was broadly consistent with our expectations, so we decided to take another step forward.", "'QUESTION': Would a downward revision in the inflation forecast be enough to keep rates steady, or do you need to see below trend growth and decelerating labor income growth to be convinced that enough has been done?\n\n'ANSWER': We will be looking at all the data, including the signal from June's CPI, growth data, and labor market data, to make an overall judgment. While the totality of the data is important, our focus is on making progress on inflation.", "QUESTION: Would another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to maintain a slower pace and defer a decision on a second rate hike until the fall?\n\nANSWER: We will consider two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, and other activity data in September to make a decision. If the overall signal suggests the need for further tightening, we will proceed with another hike. However, it ultimately depends on the data, which we currently lack.", "'QUESTION': How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of 3 percent, and with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side of the dual mandate?\n'ANSWER': It is positive that headline inflation has decreased significantly as it affects the public's perception. This decrease may further contribute to inflation continuing to decline. However, I apologize, could you please repeat your question?", "'QUESTION': How much harm are we still seeing from inflation being at three?\n'ANSWER': It's a matter of balancing the risks of doing too much or too little. While inflation has moderated, we still face the risk of it increasing again. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, is still elevated, so we need to maintain restrictive policy and be ready to raise rates further if necessary.", "'QUESTION': How much unemployment is justified to achieve the last bit of inflation?\n'ANSWER': While the aim is not to raise unemployment, historical records suggest that when central banks slow the economy to bring down inflation, there tends to be some softening in labor market conditions. The worst outcome would be to not address inflation, as the long-term social costs of failing to do so are greater.", "'QUESTION': Should the policy be more restrictive given the positive economic indicators and potential inflationary factors, or is the economy moving towards disinflation?\n'ANSWER': The goal is to ease supply constraints, normalize pandemic-related distortions, and achieve moderate economic growth to alleviate inflationary pressures. While progress is being made, policy has not been restrictive enough for a sustained impact. The intention is to maintain a restrictive policy until inflation reaches the 2 percent target, with a possibility of further tightening. The process is expected to continue for a while.", "'QUESTION': Do you think you are restrictive enough under current conditions unless something changes?\n'ANSWER': Today's rate hike was appropriate, but we will be monitoring incoming data to determine if further action is necessary. If the data suggests that more needs to be done, we will collectively make that decision.", "QUESTION: If September is a live meeting, how does that align with the need for a more gradual tightening pace?\n\nANSWER: A more gradual pace doesn't mean every other meeting, it could be two out of three meetings. The goal is to slow down the decision cycle as we approach our destination. We don't want to provide a lot of forward guidance due to uncertainty. We will make decisions based on data.", "'QUESTION': So we shouldn't assume that every other meeting is the lowest tightening frequency let's say. It could be you know, longer intervals in between as well.\n'ANSWER': I think we're going to make a decision about the next meeting and then we're going to make a decision about the one after that. And I think it'll sort itself out.", "'QUESTION': Where does Chair Powell stand on the debate about the transmission of monetary policy into the economy?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell acknowledges that there is a debate about the lags between changes in financial conditions and the response from economic activity and inflation. While financial conditions now move in anticipation of decisions, it is uncertain if the process has changed. The length of the lags is also uncertain, but the Federal Reserve is determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent and will keep monetary policy restrictive until it is no longer appropriate.", "'QUESTION': Did the latest SLOOS data indicate a significant credit contraction beyond expectations?\n'ANSWER': The SLOOS data, which will be released next week, is broadly consistent with expectations. It shows tight and tightening lending conditions, with weak demand. It is difficult to determine the specific sources of these conditions, but the overall picture is one of tight credit conditions.", "'QUESTION': Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what share of that credit you would give to factors that don't stem directly from rate hikes or that might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year?\n'ANSWER': The inflation surge during the pandemic was due to high demand and limited supply caused by the pandemic and policy responses. We expected disinflation to come from the normalization of pandemic-related conditions and restrictive monetary policy. Factors like lower energy and food prices, supply normalization, and a shift from goods to services have contributed to lower inflation. Monetary policy will continue to play a role, especially in non-housing services.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the core will rely more on seeing an impact from rate hikes or is there a more even split?\n'ANSWER': Monetary policy will be important going forward, especially in the non-housing services sector, as we are currently experiencing the effects of the reversal of pandemic-related factors, particularly in the goods sector with supply chains and shortages moving.", "'QUESTION': Is the easing of input cost pressures in the manufacturing sector an indication of wage inflation pressure? How can pressure on wage inflation be targeted without causing a recession?\n'ANSWER': The easing of input cost pressures in the manufacturing sector suggests that supply chains and shortages are improving. As for targeting wage inflation, it requires a careful approach to avoid pushing the economy into a recession.", "'QUESTION': How do you target wage inflation without causing a recession?\n'ANSWER': We are not specifically targeting wage inflation. Our focus is on achieving a broad cooling in labor market conditions, which we are currently observing. Wages have been gradually decreasing, but still consistent with 2 percent inflation. Various indicators, such as surveys and job market trends, show a cooling in labor market demand. This gradual slowdown is beneficial as it allows for a balanced economy driven by strong labor demand and consumer spending.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about a trend of series of big unions pushing wage inflation?\n'ANSWER': Not for us to comment on contract negotiations. We monitor things and will keep an eye on them, but it's not our job or role to handle such matters.", "'QUESTION': Is the level of inflation or the speed at which inflation is falling more important when considering when to start cutting rates?\n'ANSWER': Both the level of inflation and the speed at which it is falling are taken into account when deciding to cut rates. It depends on a wide range of factors and there is uncertainty about what will happen in the future, making it difficult to predict exactly when rate cuts will occur.", "'QUESTION': Would you cut rates if inflation remains stubbornly high?\n'ANSWER': I'm not giving any numerical guidance on that. We would be comfortable cutting rates when we're comfortable doing so, but I don't think it will happen this year. We will assess the situation next year and make a judgment based on our confidence in inflation reaching our 2 percent goal.", "QUESTION: Has the staff changed its view on the likelihood of a recession and have you become more confident in achieving a soft landing?\n\nANSWER: No, the staff now predicts a noticeable slowdown in growth but no longer forecasts a recession. While achieving a soft landing is my consistent view, it is still a long way from assured. The independent staff forecast, along with individual participant forecasts, strengthens our decision-making process.", "QUESTION: Is there reason for optimism that inflation has come down and the labor market is still strong?\n\nANSWER: I wouldn't use the term optimism yet, but there is a pathway. We have seen the beginnings of disinflation without any negative impact on the labor market. However, historical records suggest that there will likely be some softening in labor market conditions as we proceed. So far, we have seen softening through factors like job openings and quits rate, which is healthy for the labor market. We hope this cooling trend continues.", "QUESTION: How close does inflation need to get and how many months of data are needed before the Fed declares victory and stops hiking rates?\n\nANSWER: The Fed does not need to wait for inflation to reach 2 percent before stopping rate hikes. If inflation comes down sustainably, they can move back to a neutral level and even below it. The timing and level of action would depend on careful assessment of inflation, but the Fed does not expect to reach 2 percent inflation until around 2025.", "QUESTION: Does the acquisition of PacWest by Bank of California suggest that the full impact of regional bank failures has not been felt, or have we already seen most of the ripple effects?\n\nANSWER: Chair Powell did not comment on the specific merger proposal, but stated that overall credit conditions have settled down. Deposit flows have stabilized, capital and liquidity remain strong, and bank lending is stable. While some banks may be tightening more than others, the tightening credit conditions will restrain economic growth.", "'QUESTION': How is the tightening interest rate policy affecting the outlook for setting policy?\n'ANSWER': The expected result of tightening interest rate policy is that bank lending conditions would also tighten. It is uncertain if it is more effective this time due to the events in May. However, the current data shows strong spending and a strong economy, which has made us confident in raising interest rates for the third time since March. We are monitoring the economy closely.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about the inflationary impact of wages outpacing inflation and its effect on consumer sentiment and the strength of the consumer?\n\n'ANSWER': Wages exceeding inflation is positive, but we want wages to align with 2 percent inflation. Nominal wages have been gradually decreasing, which is expected to continue. While wages were not a major cause of inflation initially, they will be an important factor in bringing inflation down. Further softening in labor market conditions is needed.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed's explanation for continuing to keep rates elevated or raise them if it starts to negatively impact families and the labor market?\n\n'ANSWER': The Fed's main goal is to control inflation and restore price stability, which they believe is crucial for the well-being of families, especially those with lower incomes. They emphasize that inflation disproportionately affects low-income individuals who struggle to absorb price increases, and delaying or failing to address inflation would only lead to greater pain in the long run.", "'QUESTION': To what extent was the FOMC meeting actually a live one? Was there any doubt about the decision?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell acknowledged that there is a range of views within the Committee, which will be reflected in the upcoming minutes. While some meetings have less uncertainty, the decision-making process is still followed, even if the outcome is not fundamentally in doubt.", "'QUESTION': What does the recent loosening of financial conditions mean for the Fed's ability to bring down inflation?\n'ANSWER': The Fed closely monitors financial conditions, including the dollar and equities, and is focused on using its policy tools to control inflation. If financial conditions become looser, the Fed may need to take additional measures, but over time they expect to achieve their inflation target.", "'QUESTION': Do you expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year, while also continuing QT?\n'ANSWER': It is possible for the Fed to cut rates while continuing quantitative tightening (QT), depending on the economic conditions. However, the active tool of monetary policy is rates, and the balance sheet normalization would involve reducing or continuing QT, depending on the cycle. These are two independent actions that can work in different ways, but it may not be the case in this scenario.", "'QUESTION': Have banks taken steps to be proactive in assuring they are ready to use the discount window, and should policies be implemented to ensure regular testing?\n'ANSWER': Yes, banks are working to be prepared to use the discount window, and we strongly encourage them to do so. During the events of March, it was found that accessing the discount window can be slow and inefficient. Being more prepared would allow for quicker access if needed.", "QUESTION: Where do you see the current situation and balance of the housing market, considering constrained inventory, reluctance of existing homeowners to move, high mortgage rates, and tightening lending standards?\n\nANSWER: We still have a ways to go to achieve balance in the housing market. The tight supply of existing homes, driven by low-rate mortgages, is keeping prices high. Although there is new supply coming online, first-time buyers are facing elevated mortgage rates. It will take time to work through these challenges, especially considering the ongoing effects of the pandemic.", "'QUESTION': How could Russia's withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative contribute to higher food prices and inflation, and how closely are you monitoring the situation?\n'ANSWER': We are closely monitoring the situation as the withdrawal raises concerns about global food security, especially for poorer countries that heavily rely on food imports. Grain prices have increased, but they are still below last spring's peak. The current moves are not expected to significantly impact U.S. inflation, but we will continue to monitor the situation carefully.", "'QUESTION': So you don't think it would have a big effect on Fed policy at this point?\n'ANSWER': Looking at what we know now, it doesn't seem to have a significant impact on Fed policy. Thank you."]}
