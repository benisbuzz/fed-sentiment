Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, the markets anticipate you will raise rates once or twice next year.  Are they wrong?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I would say it this way.  We try to focus on what we can control \u2014and that is how to communicate as clearly as possible, in this highly uncertain world, how we \u2019re thinking about the economic outlook and the balance of risks and how policy will evolve in that case and also in the cases, which are frequent , where the economy evolves in unexpected ways.  So the focus at this meeting is on tapering asset purchases, not on raising rates.   It is time to taper, we think, because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals, measured from last December.  We don\u2019 t think it \u2019s time yet to raise interest rates.  There is still ground to cover to re ach maximum employment , both in terms of employment and in terms of participation.   Getting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and shortages will persist well into next year, and elevated inflation as well, and that , as the pandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate\u2014and job growth will move back up.  And as that happens, inflation will decline from today\u2019 s elevated levels.  Of course, the timing of that is highly uncertain.  B ut, certainly , we should see inflation moving down by the second or third quarter.  The time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on the path of the economy.   We think we can be patient.  If a response is called for, we will not hesitate.   So, what I will tell you is , we will be watching carefully to see whether the economy evolves in line with our expectations, and policy will adapt appropriately. And that \u2019s what I would say.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Based on \u2014if I could follow up, based on your c urrent outlook for the labor market, do you think it \u2019s possible\u2014or likely , even \u2014that maximum employment could be achieved by the second half of next year?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So if you look at the progress that we \u2019ve made over the course of the last year, if t hat pace were to continue, then the answer would be :  \u201cY es, I do think that that is possible. \u201d  Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but it\u2019s certainly within the real m of possibility.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  I was wondering if you could detail a little bit how you\u2019 re thinking about wages at this moment.  Obviously, we \u2019re seeing strong wage growth, particularly for people in sort of lower- income fields.   I wonder if you see that as a positive thing or as a potential start to a wage \u2013price spiral and sort of how you sort of delineate those two things.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly.  A nd, in particular, I would point to the e mployment c ompensation i ndex reading that we got last Friday.  Now, in real terms, they \u2019ve been \u2014they had been running a little bit below inflation, so real wages were not really increasi ng.  I think, with the ECI reading, it becomes close to maybe not increasing , but close to back to zero in terms of the real increase.  So wages moving up, of course, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation.  It\u2019 s very important, and it \u2019s generally a good thing.  You know, the concern is  a somewhat unusual case where, if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and productivity gains, that could put upward pressure on, or downward pressure  on margins and cause companies to \u2014or employers , really \u2014to raise prices as a result, and you can see yourself, find yourself in what we used to call a wage \u2013price spiral.  We don\u2019 t have evidence of that yet.  Productivity has been very high.  The ECI reading is just one reading.  Again, if you look back,    we\u2014so we \u2019ll be watching this carefully .  But I would say that , at this point, we don\u2019 t see troubling increases in wages .  And we don\u2019 t expect those to emerge, but we\u2019 ll be watching carefully.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wonder if you could perhaps give us your thinking about the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment.  You talked about the shortfall of unemployment \u2014reemployment relative to befo re the pandemic, and yet you have inflation, which is affecting everybody.  Are we at , or close to , a point where the risk of inflation is greater than the benefit that you \u2019d\u2014for recovering these lost jobs so that now , from a risk -management standpoint, it makes sense to move more aggressively on rate hikes?   And k ind of a related question:  T he statement today says you\u2019 ll keep policy accommodative until you hit that 2 percent  inflation target.  Our surveys show looking for 5 per cent inflation this year, 3 \u00bd percent  next year \u2014it sure seems like you \u2019re on track to modestly or moderately exceed that 2 percent  target.  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  So I \u2019m not sure I totally got your first question, but I would say\u2014in fact, could you just quickly, succinctly, say your first question again?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Sure.  The idea that the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, that you would keep policy accommodative to put this 5 million folks, or find these 5 million jobs  again, at the same time all Americans will be suffering from higher inflation \u2014is that tradeoff worth it, or is it better or smarter to raise rates right now to combat inflation and perhaps not lean so heavily on the employment side of the mandate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s, so, you know, this isn \u2019t the traditional Phillips curve situation where there \u2019s a direct tradeoff, where  that\u2019s really what we \u2019re talking about.  The inflation that    we\u2019re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market.  It \u2019s due to bottlene cks, and it \u2019s due to shortages, and it \u2019s due to very strong demand meeting those.  So I think it \u2019s not the classical situation where you have that precise tradeoff.   But, you know, in this situation, we do have a provision in our S tatement o n Longer -Run Goals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is , we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over  which employment and inflation are projected to retur n to levels judged consistent with the mandate.  So we used to call that the \u201c balanced approach \u201d paragraph .  We have to think about the amount of the deviation, w e have to think about the time it will take, and we have to make policy in a world where the t wo goals are in tension.  It\u2019s very difficult.   But what it really boils down to is something that \u2019s common sense .  And that is risk management.  We have to be aware of the risks that we\u2019 re\u2014particularly now the risk of significantly higher inflation.  We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year, well into next year.  We see higher inflation persisting, and we have to be in position to address that risk should it become really a threat to \u2014should it create a threat of more persistent, longer- term inflation .  And that \u2019s what we think our policy is doing now.  It\u2019 s putting us in a position to be able to address the range of plausible outcomes.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  Chair Powell, what are the economic conditions that would perhaps warrant a faster pace of tapering ?  And I\u2019m wondering how you w ould also characterize the risks that the F ed may actually need to accelerate that process eventually.  Thank you.   \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I guess , as I said in my opening remarks, assuming the economy performs broadly as expected, the Committee  judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, and we \u2019re prepared to deviate from that path if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.   So I\u2019m not going to give you a lot more detail on what that might be.  Of course, if we do see something like that happening, if it b ecomes a question, then we \u2019ll communicate very transparently and openly about that.  But I \u2019m just going to leave it with the words that are in the statement.   Sorry, was there a second part? \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Ye s.  It\u2019s just on characterizing the risks that you might actually have to do so later on.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, I would just leave you with the words we have here.  We are prepared to speed up or slow down the pace of reductions in asset purchases if it \u2019s warranted by changes in the economic outlook.  And , again, if we feel like something like that \u2019s happening, then we \u2019ll be very transparent about it.  We wouldn\u2019 t want to surprise markets.  We \u2019ll say, in light of this factor or these factors, we are considering doing this, and then we would either d o it or not do it.  But so \u2014but I \u2019m not going to, you know, start making up examples of what that might be today.  Thanks.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  You mentioned at the beginning that the F ed understands the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, especially those with limited means.  What is your message to t hose    families or consumers that are struggling with higher prices right now, and do you feel that your expectations around transitory inflation, that message is reaching them?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  So, first of all, it is our job to \u2014and we accept responsibility and accountability for inflation in the medium term.  We\u2019 re accountable to Congress and to the American people for maximum employment and price stability.  The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability.   By the way, we \u2019re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned.  So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control.   We don\u2019 t think it \u2019s a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the labor market heal further .  And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the Delta variant declines, s o\u2014which it \u2019s doing now.  So \u201c transitory \u201d is a word that people have had different understandings of.  For some, it carries a sense of \u201cshort lived, \u201d and that \u2019s, you know, there \u2019s a real time component \u2014measured in months, let \u2019s say.   Really , for us, what \u201c transitory \u201d has meant is that if something is transitory, it will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation.  So that \u2019s why we, you know, we took a step back from \u201c transitory. \u201d   We said \u201cexpected to be transitory ,\u201d first of all, to show u ncertainty around that \u2014we\u2019ve always said that, by the way, in other context s; we just hadn \u2019t done it in the statement \u2014but also to acknowledge, really, that it means different things to different people.  And then we added some language to really explain more what we \u2019re talking about in paragraph two and paragraph three.  We said that \u201csupply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,\u201d  and we said , \u201cProgress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in    economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. \u201d  So we \u2019re trying to explain what we mean and also acknowledging more uncertainty about \u201ctransitory. \u201d   So it\u2019s, I mean , it\u2019s become a word that \u2019s attracted a lot of attention that maybe is distracting from our message, which we want to be as clear as possible.   Ultimately, the only other thing I would say is, look, we understand completely that it \u2019s particularly people who are living paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs \u2014when the winter comes, higher heating costs for their homes.  We understand completely what they\u2019 re going through.  A nd, you know, we will use our  tools over time to make sure that that doesn \u2019t become a permanent feature of life.  R eally , that\u2019s one of our principal jobs, along with achieving maximum employment .  And that \u2019s our commitment.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Great.  Thank you, Michelle.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Well, I wonder if you could update us .  You talked about getting back to full employment, and so could you update how you define that?   I mean , you\u2019 ve, you know \u2014a few months ago, yourself and other F ed officials talked about getting back to the pre -COVID labor market.  There w ere even hints you might try to do something better than that.  Now we heard talk of, as you mentioned, people retiring, and there \u2019s talk of not being able to get back as\u2014all the jobs back because of that and other trends.  You did mention the prime -age folks.  So can you give us some examples of things you're looking at , specifically , to measure full employment ?  Will you be looking at prime -age employment population ratio, for example, and, if so, do you need to see it get back to pre-COVID levels to achieve maximum employment, or is there something short of that that would work?   Thank you.   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thanks.  So maximum employment is, it \u2019s a broad \u2014what would we say?\u2014broad -based and inclusive goal that \u2019s not directly measurable and changes over time due to various factors.  You can\u2019 t specify a specific goal.   So it \u2019s taking into account quite a broad range of things, and, of course, employment \u2014levels of employment \u2014[and]  participation are a part of that.  But , in addition, there are other measures of what \u2019s going on in the labor market, like wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is \u2014the level of quits , the amount of job openings , the flows in and out of various states.  So we look at so many different things, and you make an overall judgment.   Now, the temptation at the beginning of the recovery was to look at the data in February of 2020 and say, well, that \u2019s the goal because we didn\u2019 t know any\u2014that \u2019s what we knew.   We knew that w as achievable in a context of low inflation.   I think we \u2019re in a, you know, we \u2019re learning that.   We have to be humble about what we know about this economy, which is still very, you know, COVID -affected, by the way.  A lot of what we \u2019re seeing in the last 90 days is because of Delta.  We were on a path to a very different place.  Delta put us on a different path .  And we see these things.   But, so I think we \u2019re going to have to\u2014ideally , we would have, we would see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn \u2019t another COVID spike, and then we would be able to see, I think, a lot.  We would see whether \u2014how does participation react in that world, in that sor t of post -COVID world ?   Right now, people are staying out of the labor market because of caretaking [and]  because of fear of COVID to a significant extent.  You know, we thought that schools reopening and elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply.  That doesn\u2019 t seem to have been the case, interestingly.  So I think there \u2019s room for a whole lot of humility here , as we try to think about what maximum employment would be.  We\u2019 re going to    have to see some time post -COVID so that we know \u2014or post -Delta, anyway \u2014to see what is possible.  And I think the learning for those of us who lived through the last cycle is that , over time, you can get to places that didn\u2019 t look possible.   Now, what we also have now , though, is , we hav e high inflation.  So we have a completely different situation now where we have high inflation, and we have to balance that with what \u2019s going on in the employment market.  So it\u2019s a complicated situation, and I would say, we will, we hope to achieve signi ficantly greater clarity about where this economy is going and what the characteristics of the post -pandemic economy are over the first half of next  year.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: The two tests in the state ment \u2014the guidance that it has to hit 2 percent  and be on track to moderately be above 2 percent .  Has the economy cleared that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  That \u2019s a decision for the Committee .  I would put it to you this way.  When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee \u2019s judgment, it \u2019s very possible that the inflation test will already be met.  We\u2019re aware that that language sounds, it sounds a little out of touch with what \u2019s going on, but , you know, we \u2019re not at maximum employment.  When that is the case, we\u2019ll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there \u2019s a good chance that it will be if you look at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  So, to follow up, so you\u2019 re not willing to commit that the current levels of inflation and their persistence have met \u201cmoderately \u201d and \u201c for some time. \u201d  So, given that, I mean, how should we wonder what \u201cmoderately \u201d over and \u201c for some time \u201d mean?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: What I \u2019m really saying is, that question is not before us right now.  You know, we had the question on when to taper.  We\u2019 ve now answered that question and the speed of i t and all that.  We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test , because we don\u2019t meet the liftoff test now because we\u2019 re not at maximum employment.   What I \u2019m saying is, given where inflation is and where it \u2019s projected to be, let \u2019s say we do mee t the maximum- employment test .  Then the Committee \u2014the question for the Committee  at that time will be , has the inflation test been met ?  And, you know, I don\u2019 t want to get ahead of the Committee  on that, but the answer may very well be \u201cY es, it \u2019s been met .\u201d  But we \u2019re not asking that question today, because we\u2019 re not running a liftoff test.  W e\u2019re not evaluating the  liftoff test today.  We didn \u2019t have that discussion at today\u2019s meeting.  We did talk about the economy and the development of the economy, but we didn\u2019 t ask ourselves whether the liftoff test is met, because, you know, it \u2019s clearly not met on the maximum -employment side.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Chair Powell.  M atthew Boesler with Bloomberg.  So, when you\u2019 re looking at this question of assessing whether or not the U.S. economy is at maximum employment, do you have a framework for making that judgment that is independent of what inflation is doing?  And , if not, does it kind of complicate that assessment, given all of the uncertainty about inflation right now and the inclination to believe that, you know, the high inflation we \u2019re seeing is not related to capacity utilization in the labor  market ?  Thank you.   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we don\u2019 t actually define maximum employment as \u2014we define it in terms of inflation, but , of course, there is a connection there.  Maximum employment has to be a level that is consistent with stable prices.  But that \u2019s not really how we think about it.  We think about maximum employment as looking at a broad range of things.  You can\u2019 t just look at\u2014unlike inflation, where you can have a number .  But with maximum employment, you could be in a situation , hypothetically, w here the unemployment rate is low, but there are many people who are out of the labor force and will come back in.  And so you wouldn\u2019 t really be at maximum employment , because there\u2019 s this group that isn \u2019t counted as unemployed.  So we look at a range of things.  So the thing is , by many measures , we are at a very tight labor market.   I mentioned quits and job openings and wages and things .  Many of them are signaling a tight labor market, but the issue is, how persistent is that?  B ecause you have people who are held out of the labor market, you know, of their own\u2014they\u2019 re holding themselves out of the labor market because of caretaking needs or because of fear of COVID , or, for whatever reason, they \u2019re staying out.  And it \u2019s clear th at there are, you know \u2014with tremendous demand for workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we \u2019re set up to go back to a higher job-creation  rate.  So that would suggest that you\u2019 re not at maximum employment.   So, at the end of the day, it is a judgme nt thing.  But, of course, at the end of it, it also has to be a level of employment that \u2019s consistent with price stability.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  And if I could just follow up briefly, you know, you\u2019ve  talked a little bit about this possibility that the two goals might be in  tension and how you would have to balance those two things .  Could you talk a little bit about what the F ed\u2019s process for balancing those two goals would be in the event that, say, come next year , you decide there \u2019s a serious risk of persistent inflationary pressures despite ongoing employment shortfalls?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  I mean, again, it \u2019s a risk -management thing.  It \u2019s not \u2014I can \u2019t reduce it to an equation, but , ultimately, it\u2019 s about risk management.  So you want to be in a position to act, to cover the full range of plausible outcomes, not just the base case.  And in this case, the risk is skewed .  For now , it appears to be skewed toward higher inflation.  So w e need to be in a position to act in case it becomes necessary to do so or appropriate to do so, and we think we will be.  So that \u2019s how we \u2019re thinking about it.  And I think, though, that , judgmentally , too, it \u2019s appropriate to be patient.   It\u2019s appropria te for us to see what the labor market and what the economy look like when they heal further.   We know that we were on a path to a different place, a s I mentioned, when D elta arrived .  And D elta stopped, it stopped job creation.  It stopped that transitio n away from a goods -focused economy where there \u2019s excess demand for goods because ther e\u2014services are not available.  People are not traveling.  That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because , presumably , people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel and all sorts of travel services and things like that.  So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation.  Bottlenecks should be abating.  We start to see that now with some of them, but , overall, they haven \u2019t gotten better overall, and, you know, we \u2019re very aware of that.  So that \u2019s really how we \u2019re thinking about it.  We \u2019re thinking that time will tell us more.  In the meantime, we don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s time to raise rates now.  You know, if we do conclude that it \u2019s necessary to do so, then we \u2019ll be patient, but we won\u2019 t hesitate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the call.  So the Federal Reserve\u2014I want to talk about climate change .  The Federal Reserve released a statement today\u2014says  \u201cthe Federal Reserve supports the efforts . . . to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate -related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory\u201d  outcomes.  Is this putting us on the path to regulate what banks can offer loans on or invest in, like coal plants or fossil fu els?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So that \u2019s not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency.  That \u2019s a decision for elected representatives.   So we feel that any role that we have\u2014and we do think we have a role in climate change.  It relates to our existing mandat es, and our existing mandates are, really , prudential regulation of financial institutions.  We expect them , and the public will expect us to expect them , to understand and be in a position to manage their risks.  So that \u2019s physical risk, and it \u2019s transition risk for climate .  And, by the way, the large financial institutions are doing this already, and, you know, we think that \u2019s right within our mandate.  There \u2019s also a financial stability question , the overall stability of the financial system.  And so, from that standpoint, we can do research.  We can try to help understand what will the pathways be through which climate change effects the economy\u2014both physical risk and transition risk .  That \u2019s what we can do, and that \u2019s what we will do .  And we \u2019ll do it well.  W ithin the frame of our existing mandates , we\u2019ll do it well.   We \u2019re not the people who will decide the national strategy on climate change.  That has to be elected people, and not so much us.  We feel like we have that narrow mandate, and we  will do it well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  So the F ed recently announced that there is going to be new conflict -of-interest rules for investments by F ed officials, and this follows, obviously, the resignation of two regional F ed presidents.  And I \u2019m just wondering, do you think that there is more that you will need to do to rebuild the credibility of the F ed, such as, you know, requiring officials to put their assets in blind trusts?  And also, if you could speak to whether you have any concerns that any rules or laws were broken by F ed officials.   Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we, you know, we \u2014let me just say that this system, the ethics system we had in place had been in place for decades and had, as far as we know, served us well, and then that was no longer the case.   And so we had no moment of denial about that.  As a group, we stepped in, and we took the actions that we took.  A nd, you know, wi thin one FOMC cycle, we announced a new set of rules to, you know, to try to put us back where we need to be, which is , we need to have the complete trust of the American people that we\u2019 re working in their interest all the time \u2014absolutely critical to our w ork, as it is for any government agency.  A nd I feel like this called that into question.   So we reacted, I would characterize it, strongly and forcefully.  If there were other things that we could do that were reasonable, we would certainly do them.  So you asked me about blind trusts.  You know, the overall authority for ethics around these issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics, OGE .  And they have a long- held position which is not favorable to blind trusts.  They do not encourage them.  They don\u2019t think they\u2019 re effective.  They think they \u2019re cumbersome .  And they think there are better ways to get at the things that need to be done .  And those are the things that we \u2019re actually doing.  So I don\u2019 t know that there are any blind trusts , for that reason, because they are the, they \u2019re the regulator .  They say this on their website , if you look.  In terms of laws broken, you know, I    asked the inspector g eneral to look to see whether there were rules broken and whether there were laws broken, and I won\u2019 t speculate on that .  But that is with the i nspector g eneral now and, of course, out of my hands.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, the critics of your patience policy argue that , given the long and variable lags with which monetary policy works, that you are likely to end up, given inflation, by having to raise rates faster and farther than you would have liked and, therefore , send the economy into recession.  Given the  fact that , basically , your forecast has been chasing inflation over the last year, and now you\u2019 re talking about it not coming down until the second or third quarter , why would they be wrong in thinking that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, so, let me say what \u2019s hap pened\u2014 and we \u2019re very, very straightforward about it \u2014is that inflation has come in  higher than expected, and bottlenecks have been more persistent and more prevalent.  We see that just like everybody else does, and we see that they \u2019re now on track to persis t well into next year.  That was not expected \u2014not expected by us, not expected by other macro forecasters.   Now, let me say, you know, it \u2019s difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal times.  When you\u2019 re talking about, you know, global supply chains in turmoil, it \u2019s a whole different thing .  And you\u2019 re talking about a pandemic that \u2019s holding people out of the labor force for reasons that we can sample, but we don\u2019 t have a lot of experience with this .  So it\u2019s very, very difficult to forecast an d not easy to set policy.  So we have to set policy, though.  So that \u2019s what we \u2019re doing.   And, you know, so, to look at your question this way, I don\u2019 t think that we \u2019re behind the curve.  I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible    outcomes, and that \u2019s what we need to do.  I do think it would be premature to raise rates today.  That\u2019s not \u2014I don\u2019 t think that \u2019s controversial.  Certainly, I don \u2019t know anyone arguing for that today.  A nd the r eason is that there \u2019s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment .  And we don\u2019 t want to stop that when there \u2019s good reason to think \u2014there \u2019s still good reason to think, although it \u2019s been delayed, clearly, there \u2019s good reason to think that the economy will reopen, particularly if we do get past, you know, significant outbreaks of COVID .  That\u2019s when we \u2019re really going to see what the characteristics of the labor market are.   And, you know, I think, you know, the bottlenecks that we \u2019re seeing in global supply chains around goods and, frankly , now at our own domestic ports, because demand is stronger than the capacity of those ports \u2014those things are going to work themselves out.  We have a flexible economy.  It \u2019ll take some time, but, you know, it took\u2014you know, the experts managed to create a vaccine faster than, certainly , than I expected.  A nd I think this stuff will work itself out over the course of next year.  That is my baseline understanding, and that \u2019s a very widely held one  among people.  But, you know, we are prepared for different eventualities, and we will use our tools to achieve price stability and maximum employment .  And we \u2019re going to let the data lead us to where we need to go.  Our policy will adapt \u2014and has already  adapted \u2014to the changing understanding of inflation and of bottlenecks and the whole supply- side story \u2014which is also partly a demand story.  So our policy will continue to adapt as is appropriate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our question s.  So you announced that the F ed is going to taper at a rate of , starting at $15 billion a month, and that\u2019s more than twice the pace of the last taper.  So why are you tapering faster this time?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: The economy is in quite a different place than when we tapered back in, I guess it was , 2013.  We were much farther away from maximum employment.  Inflation was much lower.  This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong, and job openings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people.  So the need for further stimulus is far less than it was in 2013 , where we still had quite a ways to go.   I mean , after we began that taper, it was  still many years before we reached what I would characterize as conditions consistent with maximum employment, let alone  price stability.   So this is quite a different situation, and , you know, the C ommittee unanimously felt today that we had met the test that we \u2019d articulated, and this was appropriate .  And this is faster than, you know, than what people had expected six months ago.  It\u2019 s earlier and faster, and that \u2019s because our, as I mentioned, ou r policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves, as it \u2019s clarifying itself, and that \u2019s partly because we see inflation coming in higher \u2014so.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Yes, thank you for taking my questi on.  I wonder if the F ed has given any thoughts yet to the endgame for the balance sheet in terms of, you know, once you get the taper process complete, will you hold the balance sheet steady, or will you allow it to start passively winding down?   And then, in a related question, do you have any greater insight into what F ed bond buying actually does for the economy?  I n terms of its economic impact, have you been able to, you know, measure it or quantify it in any fashion, you know, because I \u2019m sure you know there \u2019s often been questions about , what is bond buying actually doing to help the economy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.   So in terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you mention\u2014we haven \u2019t gone back to them.  Now that we \u2019ve tapered, I expect that that \u2019s exactly    what we \u2019ll do in coming meetings .  And we \u2019ll do it in an orderly fashion, and we \u2019ll talk about reinvestment and all those things.  And w e don\u2019 t have to make decisions on those yet .  But, you know, typically, when we \u2019re doing a new subject like that, we \u2019ll have a series of briefings and discussions .  And that \u2019s what we will now begin to do.   In terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so, there\u2019 s a tremendous amount of research and scholarship on this .  And, you know, you can kind of \u2014you can find different people coming out with different views .  But I would say, the most mainstream view would be that you \u2019re at the effective  lower bound, so how do you a ffect longer -term rates?   There are two ways.   One, so you can\u2019 t low er rates \u2014let \u2019s say you can \u2019t lower rates any further, hypothetically.  So you can give forward guidance.  You can say, we \u2019re going to keep the rates low for a period of time, either [for] a specific period , [or] until certain conditions are met.  The marke ts will do the math, and that \u2019ll have an effect on longer -term borrowings even, you know, 10, 30 years out kind of thing.  So that \u2019s one thing.  The other thing you can do is , you just go buy those securities, buy longer -term securities.   That will drive d own longer -term rates and hold them lower, and, you know, rates right across the, right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers.  So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity.  People \u2014you can service your debt.  You have more free cash flow.   You know, it \u2019s not different from what we do at the short end.  So that was discussed long before anybody did it.  That was \u2014I think Milton Friedman said that that was what you could do if you were pinned at the lower bound, many, many years ago.  So, anyway, that \u2019s how it \u2019s supposed to work.  A nd, you know, it \u2019s quite hard to be precise about these things because, you know, you only have one economy, and you can\u2019 t run two different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment.  B ut most people     find\u2014most of the findings are that it does support economic activity in the way that you would expect, whic h is to say, at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we do what we do.  More accommodative  financial conditions lead to more economic activity , over time, with a lag .  So I think that \u2019s the main finding I would say on QE .\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Powell, Chair Powell, you\u2019 ve addressed already questions about the stock purchases that took place from some of the regional F ed presidents and , you know, addressing  the American people to make sure that they can trust the F ed.  I was wondering, also, in light of the fact that, you know, we now have questions about your own future, whether or not President Biden will nominate you for a second term, what would you say\u2014to the President and to s enators that , potentially, you know, will be voting on a renomination\u2014about this , specifically with regards to your future as F ed Chair for a possible second term?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: o I \u2019m not going to\u2014I won \u2019t have any \u2014I will answer your question, Paul, but I \u2019m not going to have any comment whatsoever on the renomination process at all.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: air enough.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I will say, though, that I have briefed A dministration officials, and I\u2019ve briefed people on Capit ol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it , and seeking their feedback, getting their reaction .  But, you know, this is \u2014part of my job is \u2014Congress has oversight over the F ed, and we take that very seriously.  So if you\u2019 re on our, one of the two committees that has oversight over us, then I \u2019m in regular contact with you , probably.  A nd, you know, when something like this comes up, I \u2019m on the phone.  I \u2019m offering to meet with you and explain it to you and answer your questions and identify any conc erns people might have.  That \u2019s    just part of my job.  So I do that.  I don\u2019 t talk about particular conversations .  But you can assume I \u2019ll always do that .  And I certainly did it in this  case.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio.   Is the Fed still planning on taking comment on ways to permanently address that, and how concerned are you, ultimately , about banks \u2019 willingness to intermediate in the Treasury markets without a permanent fix?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I don\u2019 t have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right now.  We are looking at ways to, if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that channel.  We \u2019re also \u2014we also have a\u2014there \u2019s a working group headed by [the] Treasury about, over T reasury [securities] markets , and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic , and what structural things may need to be done.  So that would be part of that workstream, and I know that there \u2019s a lot going on.  I \u2019m not sure when that report will be out.  So it\u2019s work under  way. That \u2019s one of the many issues that are part of that , along with things like central clearing of T reasuries, great er central clearing, and , you know, many other ideas.  It \u2019s important that we have a liquid T reasury [securities] market.  It\u2019s a huge public benefit that we do, and, you know, I think we need to do those things that enable that, you know, while also assur ing the safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions, who tend to be the main dealers.   So we have to make sure that that \u2019s always a first order of concern as well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  So, just to expand on the ethics conversation, you talked about how you engage with people on Capitol Hill and in the A dministration .  You talked about what you\u2019 ve done already, but I \u2019m just wondering if you can take a step back and just assess whether or not there was reputational damage as a result of that , either from the public \u2019s view or from the financial community \u2019s view of the Federal Reserve\u2019 s independence .  And then, secondly, do you look back on the whole episode and have thoughts on your individual responsibility in preventing something like this from having happened?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: ou know, I think it \u2019s too soon to say what the reputational  damage is.  I think , from the very beginning, my reaction was :  We need to deal with this straightforwardly, transparently, and forcefully.  And that \u2019s what we \u2019re going to do.  I mean , it\u2019s, it means everything to me that we do whatever it takes to make sure that nothing like this happens again, and I like to think we \u2019ve made a real good start on that.  If you think about it, you cannot execute a trade unless it \u2019s precleared, and then you have to say, \u201cE xecute. \u201d  It\u2019s not even a trade.  Really, there \u2019s no trading going on.  This is for investment and, you know, getting liquidity for life \u2019s expenses.  But you then have to wait 45 days to actually execute that sale or purchase.   So I think it \u2019s a pretty good system.  We\u2019ll always be looking to make it better.    So in terms of our independence, you know, look, I think we will address this, and I think we have .  And I like to think it \u2019s enough, but it \u2019s going to, you know \u2014we \u2019re just beginning to implement it.   We have to write the rules, which we\u2019 re doing, you know, as quickly as possible.  We need more people.  We\u2019re going to have to resource this much more significantly here at the Board, and also, we \u2019re going to need appropriate technology, because, you know, the F ed has more than \u2014the S ystem has more th an 30,000 employees.  Not all of them, far few of them, will    be covered by this, but the senior officers, who will be covered by this , will, you know, will have to have technology access, and it \u2019s going to have to work efficiently.  So there \u2019s a lot of work to do to implement.   You know, again, I would just say, this system has been in place for decades .  And it was in place when I took over.  It was in place for the last, at least the last three or four C hairs .  And, you know, it was what it was .  And, you know, it proved to have weaknesses in it.  And part of that was, it wasn \u2019t uniformly enforced across the System.  I\u2019m a big believer in the value of the Federal Reserve S ystem and the Reserve Banks .  But you had 12 different ethics officers at 12 different Banks.  And you had ethics people here .  And, you know, compliance wasn\u2019 t, it wasn \u2019t all exactly the same.   It was a little bit different and uneven, and also, the rules were\u2014you know, we didn\u2019 t imagine the problems that happened.  And they may have actually been\u2014I don\u2019t know this \u2014but they may actually have been in compliance with the specifics of our rules.  They were clearly not in compliance with the part of our rules that said , don \u2019t do anything that would create that appearance.  I mean , that \u2019s clear .  This was a bad appearance.  So, anyway, what can we do?  We are where we are.  It happened, and we just have to deal with it forthrightly and transparently and \u201c own\u201d it and step up to this, you know, meet this moment.  I \u2019m totally committed to doing that.

Chair, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on employment.  We\u2019ve seen what \u2019s been called the great resignation, folks leaving their jobs in record numbers.  Is there any feel ing there that maybe you\u2019 ve been accused of \u201cfighting the last war \u201d\u2014that perhaps the labor dynamics have changed in the post -COVID environment and that full employment may not look like what it looked like before?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  So, what \u2019s happening is , people are leaving their jobs.  They \u2019re quitting their jobs in all -time-high numbers \u2014but , in many cases, going back into employment and getting higher wages.  So a lot of the higher wages you\u2019 re seeing are for job switchers rather than incumbents.  So  that\u2019s just, that \u2019s a sign of a really strong labor market , as opposed to people just running off and quitting.  There have also been \u2014there are a significant number of retirements, and we \u2019ll just have to see what that means.   So, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic history, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was the trend, and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire.  So maybe this was just catch -up on that.  I am a believer that , over time, you won\u2019 t know how far \u2014you won\u2019 t know what can happen with labor force participation in advance.  You\u2019re just going to have t o give it some time, because we saw that over and over again.  There are things that we can, where we can say, you know, this is where the limit is.  Labor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me, and so I do think we need to be    humble about what the limits are of labor force participation.  But we expect labor force participation to pick up.  We don\u2019 t know the pace at which it will do so.  So in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think , at the very beginning of the recove ry, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in February of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history.  There  was so much to like about that labor market, a really historically good labor market\u2014never perfect, but a good labor market.    We\u2019re in a different world now. This is a \u2014it\u2019s just very different.  The pandemic recession was the deepest, and the recovery has been the fastest.  And wages didn\u2019 t really go down.  And, you know, real incomes were  more than fully replaced by fiscal policy [support] .  All of this is completely unusual.  You know, an economy w here inflation was driven by services is now inflation where \u2014all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a quarter -century.   So you ask about full employment .  I think we have to\u2014I \u2019m very open to the thought that it\u2019s going to be an empirical question of where it is located, and we \u2019re just going to learn more and more.  I mean , one thing we \u2019ll learn, I think, I hope we \u2019ll learn in the next, in the near term is, once the D elta variant really does continue to decline, what\u2019 s going to happen to employment?  Are we going to start to see over the winter, you know, significant increases in jobs again?   If you look back, the three -, six-, and nine -month average job creation is between 550,000 and 600,000.  So if you think of that as a stronger \u2014you don\u2019 t have to think back to the million -job months of June and July.  You can just think, okay, 550 to 600\u2014if we should get back on t hat path, then we would be making good progress, and we like to s ee that, of course.  So    we\u2019ll know so much more .  And, believe me, we understand.  It\u2019s a different world in so many ways .

However, the Delta variant and supply constraints have hindered progress in sectors affected by the pandemic.Despite a flattening of household spending and business investment last quarter, strong aggregate demand has been maintained throughout the year due to fiscal and monetary policy support, as well as the financial stability of households and businesses. With COVID cases declining and progress in vaccinations, economic growth is expected to accelerate this quarter, resulting in overall strong growth for the year. However, while conditions in the labor market have improved and demand for workers remains high, the pace of improvement has slowed with the recent increase in COVID cases, particularly affecting sectors sensitive to the pandemic such as leisure, hospitality, and education. The unemployment rate in September was 4.8 percent, but this figure does not fully capture the extent of employment shortfall as labor market participation remains low, partly due to population aging and retirements.The pandemic has caused a decrease in labor participation, leading to difficulties for employers in filling job openings. However, as progress is made in containing the virus, these obstacles to labor supply are expected to diminish, supporting employment and economic activity. Additionally, the economic downturn has disproportionately affected those who are least able to handle the burden, with African Americans and Hispanics experiencing higher levels of joblessness. The reopening of the economy and supply chain disruptions have contributed to significant price increases in certain sectors, resulting in overall inflation running above the 2 percent goal. Despite this, the main drivers of higher inflation are connected to the pandemic's impact on supply and demand.The FOMC acknowledges the challenges of high inflation for individuals and families, but their tools cannot alleviate supply constraints. They believe that the economy will adjust to these imbalances and inflation will eventually decline, although it is difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints.The FOMC has decided to reduce the pace of its asset purchases, starting with a $10 billion reduction for Treasury securities and a $5 billion reduction for agency mortgage-backed securities. Similar reductions are expected each month, with the goal of ceasing increases in securities holdings by the middle of next year. However, the decision to taper asset purchases does not indicate any change in interest rate policy, as the committee maintains a separate and stricter test for raising the federal funds rate.In conclusion, the Federal Open Market Committee acknowledges the nationwide impact of its actions on communities, families, and businesses, emphasizing its commitment to serving the public mission. The Fed assures its dedication to achieving price stability and restoring employment, expressing gratitude and anticipation for further inquiries.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Are the markets wrong in anticipating that the Federal Reserve will raise rates once or twice next year?\n'ANSWER': The focus of the current meeting is on tapering asset purchases, not on raising rates. While supply bottlenecks and elevated inflation are expected to persist into next year, as the pandemic subsides, job growth will increase and inflation will decline. The timing of these changes is uncertain, but the Fed will be patient and adjust policy accordingly.", "'QUESTION': Based on your current outlook for the labor market, do you think it's possible or likely that maximum employment could be achieved by the second half of next year?\n'ANSWER': If the progress made in the last year continues, then it is possible to achieve maximum employment by the second half of next year. However, maximum employment is measured based on various factors, so it is within the realm of possibility but not guaranteed.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve view the current strong wage growth and its potential impact on inflation and prices?\n'ANSWER': Wages have been increasing strongly, but in real terms, they have been below inflation. The recent Employment Compensation Index reading suggests a potential increase in real wages. While wage growth is generally positive, persistent and significant increases above inflation and productivity gains could lead to a wage-price spiral. However, there is currently no evidence of this, and the Federal Reserve does not expect troubling increases in wages. They will continue to monitor the situation closely.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment and whether the risk of inflation outweighs the benefit of recovering lost jobs, leading to more aggressive rate hikes?\n\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell asks for clarification on the first question but acknowledges the concern about the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment. He emphasizes the need for a succinct restatement of the question.", "'QUESTION': Is the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment worth it, or is it better to raise rates to combat inflation and not focus as much on employment?\n\n'ANSWER': The current situation is not a traditional Phillips curve tradeoff. The inflation we're seeing is not due to a tight labor market, but rather to bottlenecks and strong demand. We consider employment shortfalls and inflation deviations when making policy decisions, taking into account the amount of deviation and the time it will take to return to consistent levels. Risk management is crucial, particularly in addressing the risk of higher inflation persisting into the longer term. Our policy aims to position us to address a range of plausible outcomes.", "'QUESTION': What are the economic conditions that would warrant a faster pace of tapering and what are the risks that may require the Fed to accelerate the process eventually?\n\n'ANSWER': Assuming the economy performs as expected, the Committee believes that similar reductions in asset purchases will be appropriate each month. However, if there are changes in the economic outlook that warrant a deviation from this path, the Fed will communicate transparently. No further details were provided.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide more information on the risks that might lead to a change in the pace of reductions in asset purchases?\n'ANSWER': We are prepared to adjust the pace of reductions in asset purchases based on changes in the economic outlook. We will be transparent about any potential changes and communicate them to the markets beforehand to avoid surprises. However, I cannot provide specific examples of such risks at this time.", "QUESTION: What is your message to families or consumers struggling with higher prices and do you feel that your message on transitory inflation is reaching them?\n\nANSWER: We understand the difficulties faced by families with limited means due to high inflation. We take responsibility for inflation and will use our tools to control it. While we don't think it's the right time to raise interest rates, we expect the labor market to improve as the Delta variant declines. \"Transitory\" means inflation won't persistently increase prices. We acknowledge the uncertainty and have explained the concept in our statements. We are committed to ensuring that higher prices don't become a permanent feature of life.", "'QUESTION': How do you define full employment and what specific measures are you looking at to determine it?\n'ANSWER': Full employment is a broad and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time. We consider a range of factors including employment levels, participation, wages, job openings, and flows in and out of states. We need more time post-COVID to understand the labor market and its reaction to factors like caretaking and fear of COVID. Achieving maximum employment is complicated by high inflation, and we hope to gain more clarity on the post-pandemic economy in the first half of next year.", "'QUESTION': Has the economy met the guidance of reaching 2 percent inflation and being on track to moderately exceed 2 percent?\n\n'ANSWER': That decision is up to the Committee. When maximum employment is reached, it is likely that the inflation test will already be met. Although the language may seem out of touch, we are not yet at maximum employment. Once we reach that point, we will assess if the inflation test has been met, which is likely considering the recent inflation trends.", "'QUESTION': How should we interpret the terms \"moderately\" and \"for some time\" in relation to inflation levels and their persistence?\n\n'ANSWER': The question of whether we meet the liftoff test is not currently before us. Once we meet the maximum employment test, the Committee will consider if the inflation test has been met. We are not discussing the liftoff test today as it is not met in terms of maximum employment.", "'QUESTION': Do you have a framework for assessing maximum employment that is independent of inflation, and does the uncertainty about inflation complicate that assessment?\n'ANSWER': Maximum employment is defined in terms of inflation, but it is not solely based on it. It involves considering a broad range of factors, such as labor force participation and the persistence of tight labor market conditions. It is a judgment call, but it must also be consistent with price stability.", "QUESTION: Could you talk a little bit about what the Fed's process for balancing the goals of inflation and employment would be in the event of persistent inflationary pressures despite ongoing employment shortfalls?\n\nANSWER: It's a risk management approach. The Fed wants to be prepared to act in case inflationary pressures persist, even if employment is still low. Currently, the risk appears to be skewed towards higher inflation, but they want to see how the economy heals further and if the transition from goods to services spending helps bring inflation down. They will be patient but won't hesitate to raise rates if necessary.", "'QUESTION': Is the Federal Reserve planning to regulate what banks can offer loans on or invest in, such as coal plants or fossil fuels, in relation to climate change?\n'ANSWER': The decision to regulate banks' investments and loans in relation to climate change is not within the jurisdiction of bank regulators or any agency. It is a decision for elected representatives. The Federal Reserve's role in climate change is focused on prudential regulation of financial institutions, managing their risks related to physical and transition risks. They can conduct research to understand the impact of climate change on the economy, but the national strategy on climate change is determined by elected officials.", "QUESTION: Do you think there is more that needs to be done to rebuild the credibility of the Fed, such as requiring officials to put their assets in blind trusts? Do you have any concerns that any rules or laws were broken by Fed officials?\n\nANSWER: The Fed acknowledges that the previous ethics system was no longer effective and has taken strong actions to regain the trust of the American people. While blind trusts are not favored by the Office of Government Ethics, the Fed is implementing other measures recommended by them. The inspector general is currently investigating whether any rules or laws were broken.", "'QUESTION': Critics argue that your patience policy may result in having to raise rates faster and farther than desired, leading to a recession. Why would they be wrong in thinking that?\n'ANSWER': Inflation has been higher and more persistent than expected, due to bottlenecks and disruptions in global supply chains. Forecasting the economy is challenging, especially during a pandemic. We believe our policy is well positioned to address different outcomes, and it would be premature to raise rates now. We will let the data guide our policy decisions.", "'QUESTION': Why is the Fed tapering faster this time?\n'ANSWER': The economy is in a different place compared to 2013 when we last tapered. Demand is strong, job openings exceed the number of unemployed, and the need for further stimulus is less. The Committee unanimously felt that we had met the test and this faster taper is due to evolving circumstances and higher inflation.", "'QUESTION': Has the Fed decided what will happen to the balance sheet once the taper process is complete? What is the economic impact of bond buying?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has not made any decisions regarding the balance sheet yet, but they will discuss it in future meetings. As for the economic impact of bond buying, it is believed to lower long-term rates and encourage borrowing and economic activity, which is why the Fed engages in it.", "'QUESTION': What would Chair Powell say to the President and senators about his future as Fed Chair for a possible second term?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell declines to comment on the renomination process and does not provide any insight into his own future as Fed Chair.", "QUESTION: Have you briefed Administration officials and people on Capitol Hill about the actions taken by the Fed?\n\nANSWER: Yes, I have briefed Administration officials and people on Capitol Hill in detail about our actions and sought their feedback. Congress has oversight over the Fed, so I take it seriously. I am in regular contact with the committees that oversee us and offer to meet, explain, and address concerns.", "'QUESTION': Is the Fed still planning on taking comment on ways to permanently address the supplementary leverage ratio, and how concerned are you about banks' willingness to intermediate in the Treasury markets without a permanent fix?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is currently looking at ways to address liquidity issues through the supplementary leverage ratio. There is also a working group led by the Treasury examining the Treasury markets and potential structural changes. Ensuring a liquid Treasury market is important, while also prioritizing the safety of financial institutions.", "'QUESTION': Was there reputational damage to the Federal Reserve's independence as a result of the ethics conversation and what is Chairman Powell's individual responsibility in preventing it?\n'ANSWER': It is too soon to determine the reputational damage, but Chairman Powell believes in dealing with the issue transparently and forcefully. He emphasizes the importance of preventing such incidents in the future and believes they have made a good start. The system in place for decades had weaknesses and inconsistencies, and they are working on implementing improvements.", "'QUESTION': Did the Chair of the FOMC speak with the President or other Administration officials?\n'ANSWER': The Chair of the FOMC declined to disclose whether they spoke with the President or other Administration officials, stating that they will not provide any names or confirmations in that regard.", "'QUESTION': Is there any feeling that the labor dynamics have changed in the post-COVID environment and that full employment may not look like what it looked like before?\n'ANSWER': People are leaving their jobs in record numbers, but many are going back into employment with higher wages. This indicates a strong labor market rather than people simply quitting. There have also been significant retirements, and it remains uncertain how labor force participation will evolve. The pandemic recession and recovery have been unprecedented, making it difficult to define full employment. The impact of the Delta variant on employment is also a factor to consider.", "'QUESTION': Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you all for joining us today.\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell expresses gratitude for the attendees' presence."]}
