"question_answer": [["\nREPORTER:   Steve Liesman, CNBC.   Madam Chair, as you know, inflation has gone up the last two months.  We had another strong jobs report, the tracking forecast s for GDP have returned to 2 percent, and yet the Fed stands pat while it \u2019s in a process of what it said  it launched in December was a \u201c process of normalization.\u201d   So I have two questions about this :  Does  the F ed have a credibility problem , in the sense that it says it will do some \u2014one thing under certain conditions but doesn\u2019 t end up doing it ?  And then, frankly, if the current conditions are no t sufficient for the F ed to raise rates, well, what would those conditions ever look like?   \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, let me start\u2014let me start  with the question of the F ed\u2019s credibility , and you used the word \u201c promises \u201d in connection with that.  And , as I tried to emphasize in my opening statement, the paths that the participants project for the federal funds rate and how it will evolve are not a preset plan or commitment or promise of the C ommittee.  Indeed, they are not even \u2014the median should not be interpreted as a C ommittee -endorsed forecast , and there \u2019s a lot of uncertainty around each participant \u2019s projection.  And  they will evolve \u2014those assessments of appropriate policy are completely contingent on each participant \u2019s forecast of the economy and how economic events will unfold.  And they are, of course, uncertain , and you should fully expect that forecast s for the appropriate path of policy on the part of all participants will evolve over time as shocks, positive or negative, hit the economy that alter those forecasts.  So you have seen a shift this time in most participants \u2019 assessments of the appropriate path for policy , and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth \u2014for growth in the global economy outside the United States \u2014and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads.  And those changes in financial conditions and in the path of the global economy have induced changes in the assessment of individual participants in what path is appropriate to achieve our objectives.  So that \u2019s what you see.  That \u2019s what you see.  Now, I guess you asked me also what would we need to see to continue raising rates , and I think it \u2019s worth pointing out here that the Committee \u2014most participants do continue to envision that if economic developments unfold as they expect , that further increases i n the federal funds rate will prove appropriate over time .  Most participants anticipate that, a nd that the pace will be gradual.  As I emphasized, most empirical work attempting to assess what the equilibrium level of the fed funds rate is , a level that w ould be neither expansionary nor    contractionary  is\u2014those assessments are quite low at this time.  So there is accommodation in the stance of policy , and we do expect , over time , that neutral rate to move up, but, you know, we\u2019re not positive what rate \u2014what  the pace of change of that will be over time.  But , given that the economy is now close to our maximum employment objective, you know, hopefully inflation is moving up\u2014 I  mentioned, as you mentioned, recent readings on inflation have moved up.  There may be some\u2014 you know, I want to warn that there may be some transitory factors that are influencing that.  But , certainly, our projections are for a gradual increase in inflation, a nd the Committee \u2014at least , most participants continue to expect that if we follow along this course , that some further adjustments in the federal funds rate will be a ppropriate but gradual.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  Can I just follow up on this inflation point ?  Because the numbers have been t icking up, as you said \u2014somewhat , at least.  And we \u2019re also , as you said , also at a  point where we have quite close to full employment.  Is there a risk that we\u2019 re heading for an overshoot in inflation, and is there, given the greater symmetry the F ed has been flaggi ng up , in terms of its inflation target, a greater tolerance for a modest overshoot , especially given the long period of undershoots that we \u2019ve been through?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  So I want to make clear th at our inflation objective is 2 percent , and we are proj ecting a move back to 2 percent .  And we are not trying to engineer an overshoot of inflation, not to compensate for past undershoots, so 2 percent is our objective.  But it is a symmetric objective , and we certainly don \u2019t seek to overshoot our objective.  But some undershoots and overshoots are part of how the economy operates , and our tolerance for those is symmetric with respect to under - and overshoots.  We did take note in the statement of the fact that inflation ha s picked up in recent months.  I see some of that a s having to do with unusually high inflation readings in categories that tend to be quite volatile without very much significance    for inflation over time.  So I \u2019m wary and haven \u2019t yet concluded that we have seen any significant uptick t hat will be lasting in , for example, in co re inflation.  But we note \u2014the C ommittee notes , as it did in December , that we continue to monitor development trends and developments closely , and that would include both the fact that recent inflation readings have been on the high side, and, as I mentioned , on the other side, that readings on measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures have been on the low side.  So , in that sense, there are risks around the inflation forecast in both\u2014in both dire ctions\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Lindsay Dunsmuir with Reuters.  Your statement did note that, as you \u2019re saying , that inflation has picked up in recent months , and you do still see it going back to 2 percent over the medium term.  Y et policymakers have downgraded GDP growth forecast s for this year and one of the inflation measures.  So that to me would indicate a weakening economic environment , and I\u2019m wondering how , in that environment , you justify the possibility of two rate hikes this year.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So there has been a slight downgrading of the assessment of  economic growth for this year.  But, nevertheless, growth is expected to run in\u2014somewhat i n excess of  potential, so that the labor market is expected to continue to tighten, a nd by the end of the year, even edge below levels that \u2014of the unemployment rate \u2014that are estimated to be longer in the normal run, and inflation is expec ted to gradually move back to 2 percent  over time.  We still have, weighing on inflation, the influence of earlier declines in energy prices and a prolonged effect from the appreciation of the dollar , but we do expect those transitory influences to fade.  And with a continuing \u2014continuing  improvement in the labor market, I think we \u2019ll see upward pressure on infla tion.  And , in that context, the C ommittee sees it ap propriate to\u2014if things unfold in that way , to have some further incr eases in the federal funds rate.   It remains    accommodative.  A s I indicated in December \u2014the C ommittee indicated in December, we want inflation to go ba ck to 2 percent .  But we also want to be careful not to see some significant overshoots , so that we would get behind the curve and potentially be faced with a need to tighten in a very rapid fashion later in a way that could undermine the sustainability of  the employment gains we  have had.  But we do see some continued tightening in monetary policy to be appropriate in that event.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Yellen, over here.  Hi, Peter Barnes with F ox Business.  Could you get a little bit more specific about the  global and economic financial developments that continue to pose risks to the U .S. economy?  You did mention a strong dollar there just a second ago and slowing global growth.  But are you specifically concerned about , for example, China, the emerging markets , and the E .U.?  Could you expand on the risks?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So there has been , by many forecasters , a slight downgrading of forecast s of global growth in\u2014over  the coming several years.   The IMF has slightly downgraded their forecast s, and other international agencies have as well.  Chinese growth has n\u2019t proven a great surprise.  We \u2019ve anticipated that it would slow over time , and it seems to be slowing as well.  Japanese growth in the fourth quarter was negative , and that was something of a surprise.  And with respect to the euro area, recent indicators suggest perhaps slightly weaker growth.  So there\u2019 s been a number of emerging markets \u2014as you know, we \u2019re suffering under the weight of declines in oil prices that a re affecting their economic activity.  Our neighbors both to the north and south, Canada and Mexico, are feeling the impacts of lower oil prices on their growth.  So our projection for global growth, for those reasons , is slightly lower \u2014not dramatically lo wer, but enough lower to make some difference to our forecast .  And , as I indicated, I think that \u2019s part of the reason, along with the associated increase we have seen in some spreads that are involved    in\u2014enter into corporate borrowing rates, and can affect investment decisions .  It\u2019s a reason to think that a slightly lower path for the federal funds rate will be appropriate to achieve our objectives.   And so what you see here is a virtually unchanged path of economic projections and a slightly more ac commodative path that most participants are writing down for what\u2019 s necessary to achieve that.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Kate Davidson from the Wall Street Journal .  Madam Chair, you \u2019ve emphasized repeatedly that every meeting of the FOMC is a live meeting.  You have a meeting next month.  Is it possible that you could get enough information between now and then to, you know, get you comfortable with raising rates again in April , and w hat would you need to see?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I will say again that every meeting is a live meeting.  April remains a live meeting , and we will be tracking incoming data.  It\u2019s a slightly shorter period.  We have six weeks , but there will be additional data  on the labor market and on various factors that pertain to inflation .  So that \u2019s, you know, that \u2019s\u2014that is certainly a l ive possibility.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Two questi ons.  The oil \u2014lower oil prices .  I think a lot of people expect  it to lead  to more consumer spending.  What do you\u2014how do you see and how do you explain that  that hasn \u2019t worked out as well \u2014the way a lot of people expect ed?  And also, if oil prices were to pop back up to, say , $50, not that high by some standards, what impact would that have on inflation?  And w ould you be paying more attention to the overall inflation rate?  Or would you then look to the cor e rate to \u2014to\u2014to determine what the Fed \u2019s policies would be?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So let me start with the impact of oil prices on consumer s pending.  I have to say , it\u2019s very difficult when you look a t patterns of consumer spending to\u2014t here are many factors that influence it , and to definitively say that lower oil prices have not boosted    consumer spending, I \u2019m not sure we can really arrive at that conclusion in any \u2014in any  rigorous way.  The typical \u2014the average household in the United States with oil prices where they are now is probably benefiting around $1,000 a year.  And some very detailed microdata that I \u2019ve seen on household spending patte rns suggest that there may be a link , as you would expect , from reduced bill s\u2014you know, reduced amounts that people pay at the pump to other spending , like eating out at\u2014for restaurant meals and other things.  But the aggregate data,  I\u2014you know, is not as strong as it \u2014and spending is not as strong as it could be, given the decline.  And , of cour se, on the other side, we are \u2014and , you know, it may  be that it will take a while , and it \u2019s something that w ill slowly strengthen ove r time if oil prices stay low .  On the other side , of course, we have seen a marked decline in drilling activity , which ha s depressed investment spending , and, of course , very substantial layoffs in the energy sector.  With respect to impact of oil prices on inflation and what would happen if they move up, the C ommittee has generally tended to look through movements in oil prices , whether they were on the upside or on the downside, viewing it as a factor that should have a transitory influence.  And w hen I say that, what I mean is that if o il prices move up during the time that it\u2019 s moving up, it raises inflation.  But they don\u2019 t need to move down again to their previous levels for that influence to disappear , they only need to stabilize at a higher level.  And , similarly, oil prices have obviously moved down a great deal over the last year , and we \u2019re not expecting them to move back to their previous levels but to stabilize at some level.  They \u2019re obviously volatile , but, as they stabilize, the influence w ill move out of both headline \u2014of headline inflation.  And that \u2019s what you see in the forecasts of participants.  So if oil prices were to increase to 50, I mean, that would probably slightly move up our expected path for core inflation, maybe speed how rapidly    we would move back to 2 percent , but I wouldn\u2019 t think that that would be something alone that would have great policy significance.

Nevertheless, we continue to see risks , which we highlighted.  Now, I would point out that we decided not to describe the balance of risks  as weighted to the downside.  So the C ommittee did not reach that judgment, and there is no collective judgment in this statement on whether the r isks are balanced or not.  My \u2014we declined to make a collective assessment.  You know, my guess is that some participants see them as balanced , and some see them as weighted somewhat to the downside.  But I think it is important to note a couple of things.  First of all, the U .S. economy has been very resilient in recent months in the face of shocks , and we highlighted that right at the beginning of our statement , where we said that \u201c economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months .\u201d  And that\u2014that is important, that the U .S. economy continues to do well.  Second, I would say that while global developments do pose some downside risks, the risks are not all one  sided .  A number of countries \u2014including China, the e uro area , the Bank of Japan \u2014have taken measures to stimulate the economy , so there is also upside risk to the economic outlook.  And , in addition,    oil prices have rebounded from their lows , and that eases concerns about the fi nancial condition of some energy firms and the stresses facing some oil -producing economies.  And , at the same time, low oil prices continue to boost household purchasing power.  So there are risks .  We\u2019re attentive to them.  We have not described them as unbalanced to the out \u2014to the downside , and they are two  sided .  One can identify both upside and downside risks t here.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times .  Wage growth thus far has been disappointing.  It\u2019s been very uneven.  It was disappointing , figures in last month \u2019s jobs report.  Why do you think that is , and how important is sustained wage growth to removing your wariness on inflation?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I must say I \u2019m\u2014I do see broad -based improvement in the labor market , and I\u2019m somewhat surprised that we \u2019re not seeing more of a pickup in wage growth.  But at least \u2014and I have to say , in anecdotal reports, we do hear quite a number of reports of firms facing wage pressures and even broad -based, slightly faster increases in wages \u2014wage increases that they \u2019re granting.   But in the aggregate data, one doesn \u2019t yet see any convincing evidence of a pickup in wage growth.  It\u2019s mainly isolated to certain sectors and occupations.  So I  do think, consistent with the 2 percent  inflation objec tive, that there is certainly scope for further increases in wages.  The fact that we have not seen any broad -based pickup is one of the factors that suggest s to me that there is continued slack in the labor market , but I would expect wage growth to move up some\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Patrick Gillespie with CNNMoney.  Chair Yellen, numerous polls show \u2014by CNN and others \u2014show that the U .S. economy is American voters \u2019 number one concern right now .  There\u2019 s a lot of negative sentiment about the economy , yet unem ployment is low, job gains have been pretty good for the past year, a nd consumer confidence has picked up.     Why do you think there is such disparity  between  the progress \u2014between the economy and its progress and how voters feel?  And my second question is , how does a ny negative sentiment about the economy factor into your economic outlook and the decisions you make on monetary policy?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Let me start with your second question, if I might.  So in trying to judge the outlook for the economy, we do look at measures pe rtaining to consumer sentiment, and they a re in solid territory.  Household balance sheets are much improved.  Gains in inflation -adjusted disposable income are running at a healthy pace.  As I mentioned, households have bene fited pretty significantly from lower oil prices, and measures of  consumer sentiment do reflect \u2014do reflect that.  So they  are not at low level s.  And , really , the labor market, I think, has improved a great deal .  And every demographic group that, you know , we track regularly has seen improvement in their labor market situation \u2014perhaps not all equally , but almost all demographic groups have seen improvement.  So I \u2014I think it \u2019s right to say the economy is improving , and most groups are seeing benefits. That said, we know that inequality has been rising in the United States over many years, not just the last several but going back to the mid- \u201980s.  There has been downwa rd pressure on real wage groups \u2014on real wage gains for groups , particularly those that  are l ess skilled and educated, and those longer -term trends that may be assoc iated with a number of factors \u2014technol ogical change and globalization \u2014have been a concern for many, many years, a nd that may be part of what you\u2019 re\u2014we \u2019re seein g expressed.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times .  The policy, the projections \u2014the new economic projections appear to reflect an increase in your estimate of the extent of labor market slack.   You talked about one possible reason for that , which is the softness of wage growth.  Are there other considerations that have led you to increase your estimate of how much slack there is in the labor market?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  So I should point out that I think what you \u2019re talking about is the slight decline in the median estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate.  Is that \u2014is that what you \u2019re\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: That, and the slope of  the path of rate increases combined with projections of relatively low  inflation.   \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I\u2014the path of rate increases maybe slightly reflects the modest decline in estimates of the longer -run normal unemployment rate.  That, I would say , reflects, for those who brought it down, an estimate of greater slack in the labor market.  The f ed funds r ate projection is not just that .  It\u2019s also, as I mentioned, a reflection of shifts in  other views about , for example, the likely pace of global growth that affects what we need, as a policy path, to achieve our objectives.  But the slow pace of wage growth,  the fact that part -time employment for economic reasons and voluntary part -time employment remains high \u2014we have seen an upward move in labor force participation, which is heartening and suggests that there was scope there for further improvement in the la bor market.  My guess is that those things influence d individuals who wrote down a sligh tly lower number for the longer -run un employment rate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.

With respect to the nomination  for V ice C hair[man]  [for]  Supervision, t hat\u2019s a question that I think you need to pose to the White House.  I, you know, would say that we are doing  a    very good job on supervision, and, you know, we are very focused on and devote a great deal of time to that issue.  So , real ly, it\u2019s\u2014the nomi nation question is one for the White House\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Madam Chair.   John Helt man with American Banker .  The P resident last week expressed concern about what he termed \u201ccynicism\u201d  on both sides of the aisle concerning progress made since the crisis to reform the banking sector and the financial sector more generally.  Do you share that concern about , kind of , public attitudes that either not enough has been done or what has been done has not been effective in changing the regulatory landscape in banking ?  Just what are your thoughts?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I feel a great deal has been done.  We have been working at this for a number of years , and I believe we have made very substantial progress.  We have a\u2014much more capital, higher -quality capital, liquidity in the bankin g system.  Our supervision has \u2014we  have mad e very meaningful changes for \u2014in our supervision, for example.  The stress tests\u2014the  stress- test methodology that we use routinely to evaluate the robustness of the capital positions and plans of the largest institutions constitutes a quantum leap in terms of, I think, the quality of the supervision we are providing , especially of the largest firms.  So  we have finished writing most of the Dodd- Frank rules .  We  are working very hard on \u201c too big to f ail,\u201d which is of grave concern to the American people.  In addition to having a financial system that is more robust and less likely to experience a failure, we ha ve also worked very hard, continue  to work on making sure we have  the ability to resolve a firm i f it were to fail in spite \u2014in spite  of having more capital and liquidity.  And there, too, I think, we  have made very substantial progress.  A month or so ago, we came out with a r ule\u2014so -called TLAC rule\u2014that would require the largest firms to hold a substantia l buffer of long -term debt that, in the event that they were to    fail, could be bailed in to protect the taxpayer from having to bear any burden in terms of injecting capital into the firms \u2014it would provide loss absorption in that event.  And working jointly, closely with the FDIC, firms have made a great deal of p rogress with their living wills.   We\u2019re in the process of evaluating the most recent submissions.  And working with the FDIC, I think, potential techniques that could be used in the event of a failure of a significant financial institution, we  have also made a lot of progress there.  I think I was at the meeting of  financial regulators with the P resid ent when he made t hose comments, and I understood that what he was trying to tell the American people , that they should understand there really has  been very substantial progress, and that \u2019s something they should be aware of.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Can I follow up, just real quick?

But do you think that , despite all that progress , that there\u2014why hasn \u2019t that message \u2014why hasn \u2019t\u2014why haven \u2019t these improvements made its way to the public?  And perhaps, like, do you find that that is an obstacle either among people that you meet,  people in the public , or the representatives in Congress that maybe have this pervasive view that nothing has changed?  Is that an obstacle?  Is that a problem?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I think \u2014I think it \u2019s our job as we make these improvements to explain wha t we\u2019re doing and to try to educate t he public about what \u2019s happened, a nd they may not understand how much has changed.  It\u2019s certainly part of my own responsibility to try to explain that to the American people.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Karen Mracek with Market News International .  In the SEP today, the unemployment rate forecast for future years \u2014for 2017, 2018\u2014was marked dow n without changes to inflation, a nd there seems to be a growing debate about the relationship between    higher \u2014lower unemployment and higher i nflation.  What is your view about the strength of this relationship, the Phillips curve , and how does that view weigh in to just how much actual inflation versus anticipation \u2014anticipated inflation you \u2019ll need to see?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: O kay, so t hat was a com plicated question, and there \u2014let me start with the Phillips curve.  So the Phillips curve posits that there is a relationship between the degree of slack in  the labor market and inflation, a nd it is an empirical relationship that, while not absolutely tigh t, has been a con sistent relationship over time, a nd I believe that  relationship still holds.   But the impact of shifts in the unemployment rate on inflation should not be overstated.  The Phillips curve has become, according to most estimates, quite flat in the sense that movements in  unemployment have only a modest impact on i nflation , so we shouldn\u2019 t overblow how large that is. In addition, the Phillips curve theory suggests that inflation expectations are also an important driver of actual wage-  and pri ce-setting  decisions and inflation behavior, a nd I believe there\u2019 s also solid empirical evidence for that.  And it \u2019s one of the reasons that I highlighted in my statement, and we continue to highlight in the FOMC statement , that  we are tracking indicators of the inflation expectation s that matter to wage and price  setting . Now, unfortunately, we don\u2019 t have perfect measures of these things.  We have survey measures.  We know that household measures, even when households are asked about longer -term inflation \u2014at longer -term inflation, they tend to move in response to salient changes in prices that they see every day .  In part icular, when gas prices go down, which is very  noticeable to most households, you tend to see a view \u2014you tend to see responses about long -term inflation marked d own.  So that \u2019s kind of an over response to something that \u2019s transitory.  So it \u2019s difficult to get a clear read from those survey measures.     Inflation compensation a s measured in financial markets also embo dies a variety of risk premia and liquidity premia.  And so, it \u2019s also \u2014we monitor those closely and discuss them in the statement in paragra ph one , but, again, there \u2019s not a straight read on what \u2019s happening to the expectation s that influence wage and pric e setting.  But  this model continues to at least influence my own thinking , and it certainly is a factor that I and at least  some of my colleagues are incorporating in these projections\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Eri k Schatzker, Bloomberg Television.  Madam Chair, thank y ou.  Notwithstanding what the dot s tell us about rate expectations, has there been any d iscussion among members of the C ommittee about the potential need for further stimulus?  And even if there hasn \u2019t been such a discussion yet, could you share wit h us what you have learned from the reevaluation of negative interest rates, whether you consider negative interest rates effective, how effective relative to quanti tative easing, and whether the C ommittee would hyp othetically use them instead of  or in conju nction with quantitative easing  in the event that the economy should warrant further stimulus?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: .  O kay.  So what I would like to make clear is that this is not actively a subject that we are considering or discussing.  The C ommittee continues  to feel that we are on a course where the economy is improving and inflation is moving back up.  And, as I indicated, if events continue to unfold in that way, we are likely to gradually raise rates over time.  Again, that\u2019s not fixed in stone.  We\u2019ll watch how the economy behaves.  We \u2019re prepared to respond if things transpire differently , but we are not spending time actively debating and considering things we could do for additional accommodation and certainly not actively considering negative rates.   We are looking at th e experience in other countries, and I guess I would judge they seem to have mixed effects, you know, some positive and some negative things.     But, look, if we found ourselves in the unlikely situation where we needed to add accommodation , we have a range of tools .  And we know from the things we did in the past that we have a number of options with respect to the maturity, for example, of our portfolio, with respect to asset purchases or forward guida nce that remain available to us , that are tools we could turn to in the unlikely event that we need to add accommodation.

Despite global economic and financial concerns, the committee believes it is prudent to keep the current policy stance in place.The broader measure of unemployment has improved, with more people working or actively looking for work. However, there is still room for improvement as involuntary part-time employment remains elevated and wage growth has yet to show sustained growth.Core inflation has increased, but it is uncertain if this trend will continue, and factors such as energy prices and the strength of the dollar could still impact consumer prices. The Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent in the next few years, but the stability of longer-run inflation expectations is not guaranteed, as survey-based and market-based measures remain low and may not accurately reflect wage and price setting.Participants' projections for GDP growth and inflation have slightly decreased compared to previous projections, but the median projections for unemployment rate and inflation have remained relatively stable. Despite concerns about global economic prospects and softer growth abroad, these developments have not significantly impacted the Committee's overall outlook.Market expectations for policy interest rates have decreased, leading to a decline in longer-term interest rates that will help mitigate any negative impact on the domestic economy. Despite some fluctuations in stock prices and corporate bond yields, mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs have decreased. The Federal Reserve will continue to closely monitor these developments and adjust monetary policy as necessary to achieve maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.The neutral funds rate is uncertain, but if economic headwinds decrease as expected, the federal funds rate should gradually increase. The median projection for the federal funds rate rises slowly in the near term, but is expected to reach 3 percent by the end of 2018.The FOMC acknowledges the uncertainty in economic forecasts and the corresponding uncertainty in policy decisions, which can change based on adjustments to the economic outlook. The Committee does not need to decide on a specific future path for the federal funds rate, as it is inherently uncertain due to unexpected changes in the economy. Additionally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing securities to maintain accommodative financial conditions and reduce the risk of lowering the federal funds rate to zero in the event of a future adverse shock.", "question_answer_summary": ["QUESTION: Does the Fed have a credibility problem and what conditions would be sufficient for the Fed to raise rates?\nANSWER: The Fed's projections for the federal funds rate are not a commitment or promise, but are contingent on each participant's forecast of the economy. Changes in global growth and credit conditions have influenced participants' assessments of the appropriate path for policy. Most participants anticipate further rate increases if economic developments unfold as expected, but at a gradual pace.", "'QUESTION': Is there a risk of an overshoot in inflation given the recent uptick in numbers and close to full employment? Is there a greater tolerance for a modest overshoot given the long period of undershoots?\n'ANSWER': Our inflation objective is 2 percent and we are not trying to engineer an overshoot. However, some undershoots and overshoots are part of how the economy operates and our tolerance for those is symmetric. We have noted the recent uptick in inflation but haven't concluded if it will be lasting. There are risks in both directions for the inflation forecast.", "'QUESTION': How do you justify the possibility of two rate hikes this year given the downgraded GDP growth forecasts and weakening economic environment?\n'ANSWER': Despite the downgraded growth forecasts, the labor market is expected to tighten and inflation is expected to gradually move back to 2 percent. The Committee sees it appropriate to have further increases in the federal funds rate if things unfold as expected, but they want to avoid significant overshoots that could undermine employment gains.", "'QUESTION': Could you get more specific about the global and economic financial developments that pose risks to the U.S. economy? Are you specifically concerned about China, emerging markets, and the EU? Could you expand on the risks?\n'ANSWER': Global growth forecasts have been slightly downgraded by many forecasters, including the IMF. Chinese growth slowing was expected, while negative Japanese growth in Q4 was a surprise. Recent indicators suggest slightly weaker growth in the euro area. Emerging markets are suffering from declines in oil prices. Lower global growth and increased spreads in corporate borrowing rates suggest a slightly lower path for the federal funds rate.", "'QUESTION': Is it possible for the FOMC to raise rates again in April if they gather enough information?\n'ANSWER': April is a live meeting and the FOMC will be monitoring incoming data on the labor market and factors related to inflation. While the time period is shorter, it is certainly a possibility.", "'QUESTION': What impact have lower oil prices had on consumer spending and what would happen if oil prices were to increase?\n'ANSWER': It is difficult to definitively say that lower oil prices have not boosted consumer spending, as there are many factors that influence it. While some data suggests a link between reduced fuel costs and increased spending on other items, overall spending has not been as strong as expected. If oil prices were to increase to $50, it may slightly affect the expected path for core inflation, but it would not have significant policy implications. The language of \"balanced\" in the policy statement does not necessarily indicate the timing of the next rate hike.", "'QUESTION': What is the impact of oil prices on consumer spending and inflation, and what needs to happen for the risks to the economic outlook to be balanced?\n'ANSWER': Lower oil prices may boost consumer spending, but aggregate data does not show a strong correlation. If oil prices stabilize at a higher level, their influence on inflation will diminish. Risks to the economic outlook have diminished, but there are still both upside and downside risks that need to be considered.", "'QUESTION': Why has wage growth been disappointing and how important is sustained wage growth to removing wariness on inflation?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen acknowledges the lack of broad-based wage growth despite improvements in the labor market. While there are reports of firms facing wage pressures and slightly faster wage increases in certain sectors, there is no convincing evidence of a widespread pickup. This suggests continued slack in the labor market, but Yellen expects some increase in wage growth.", "'QUESTION': Why is there a disparity between the progress of the economy and how voters feel?\n'ANSWER': The economy has improved significantly, with solid consumer sentiment, improved household balance sheets, and increased disposable income. However, inequality and downward pressure on wages for less skilled and educated groups have been long-term concerns, possibly influenced by technological change and globalization.", "'QUESTION': Are there other considerations that have led you to increase your estimate of how much slack there is in the labor market?\n'ANSWER': I think what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about is the slight decline in the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate. Is that what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re referring to?", "'QUESTION': What factors influenced the path of rate increases and projections of low inflation?\n'ANSWER': The path of rate increases reflects a modest decline in estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, indicating greater slack in the labor market. It also takes into account shifts in views about global growth and the need to achieve policy objectives.

Chair Yellen acknowledges the need to communicate effectively and ensure that the American people understand the extent of the changes that have taken place.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed's view on the relationship between unemployment and inflation, and how does it affect their inflation expectations?\n'ANSWER': The Phillips curve suggests a relationship between slack in the labor market and inflation, but the impact of unemployment on inflation is modest. Inflation expectations also play a role in wage and price-setting decisions. However, measuring these expectations is challenging, as survey measures can be influenced by transitory factors and financial market measures include other premia. The Phillips curve still influences the Fed's thinking and projections.", "'QUESTION': Has there been any discussion among members of the Committee about the potential need for further stimulus and what have you learned from the reevaluation of negative interest rates?\n'ANSWER': The Committee is not actively considering or discussing the need for further stimulus. They believe the economy is improving and inflation is moving up, and if this continues, they are likely to gradually raise rates. Negative interest rates are not actively being considered, but they have a range of tools available if additional accommodation is needed."]}
