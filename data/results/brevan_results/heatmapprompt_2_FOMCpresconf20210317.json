So  could you talk us through how the , the forecasts for 2021 map into the \u201c substantial further progress \u201d definition \u2014you know, 2.4 percent inflation\u2014I  understand that \u2019s considered transitory.  That still seems like some progress there, 4\u00bd percent unemployment .  Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet \n\nCHAIR POWELL: [Laughter]  Not yet.  So, as you\u2014as you pointed out, we \u2019ve said that we would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress.  And that\u2019s actual progress, not forecast progress.  So \u2014and that \u2019s a difference from, from  our past approach.  So \u2014and what we mean by that is , is pretty straightforward.  It is , we want to see that , that the labor markets have moved \u2014labor market conditions have moved \u2014you know, have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2 percent goal.  That \u2019s what we \u2019re going to want to see.  Now, that obviously includes an element of judgment.  And when we see\u2014we \u2019ll be\u2014we\u2019ll be  carefully looking ahead.    We, we  also understand that we , we will want to provide as much advance notice of any potential taper as possible.  So when we see that we\u2019 re on track, when we see actual data coming in that suggests that we \u2019re on track to perhaps achieve substantial further progress, then we \u2019ll say so.  And we \u2019ll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  If, if  I could follow up on that, this shift in the dots \u2014why wouldn\u2019 t that suggest a weakening  of the commitment here ?  An awful lot of people shifted into 2022, it seems.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I , I don\u2019t see that at all.  You know, we , we have a , a range of perspectives on the Committee.  I welcome that.  And, you know, we , we have \u2014we  debate things, we d iscuss things, and we always come together around a \u2014around a, a  solution.  But, you know, the , the strong bulk of the Committee is , is not showing a rate increase during this forecast period.  And, you know, as , as data improve, as the outlook improves ver y significantly since the December meeting, you would expect forecasts to move up.  It\u2019 s probably not a surprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for liftoff.  Nonetheless, you know, the bulk of the Committee \u2014the , the largest part by far of the Committee is, is\u2014doesn \u2019t show a rate increase during this period.  And , again, part of that is wanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point.  We do expect that we\u2019 ll begin to make faster progress on both spending\u2014you know, labor markets and inflation as the year goes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we\u2019 re getting.

You know, there \u2019s been a lot of talk about what you all are going to do this    month, which\u2014I \u2019m happy to hear an update if you have one.   But just sort of more broadly, do you think, long  term , that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at a time when the reserve supply is going to remain large ?  And , if so, do you think the changes to the leverage ratio , inclu ding the SLR , are the way to deal with that problem \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Victoria, we \u2019ll have something to announce on that in coming days.

You know, there \u2019s\u2014the unemployment rate is \u2014you all have projections for the U -6 rate, but you \u2019ve also been, you know, really emphasizing the fact that that \u2019s not the only thing that you all are looking at.  You \u2019re also looking at labor force participation and things like that.  So are you all looking at ways of maybe adding to how you\u2019 re projecting the unemployment rate to the Summary of Economic P rojections \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, let me say, as we say in our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy, we look to a r ange of indicators on the labor market.   We never only looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of , of labor market outcomes that\u2019s in the SEP.  We look at a very broad range.  You hear us talk all the time about participation ; about em ployment to population, which is the combination of the two;  about different measures of, of  unemployment.  So it \u2019s wages, it \u2019s, it\u2019s the job flows, it \u2019s, you know, all of those things .  They go into an assessment \u2014disparities of various groups .  All that g oes into an assessment of maximum employment .    The, the \u2014trying to incorporate all of that into the Summary of E conomic P rojections would not be practical .  You know, obviously, the thing that we do include is just the unemployment rate , and that \u2019s a very insufficient statistic .  So\u2014it, it  doesn\u2019 t include a lot of other things that we \u2014that we  do look at .  And I , I wouldn\u2019 t want to say that we \u2019re looking to include the other dozen things that we look at into the SEP .  But at time \u2014from time to time, we do look at , at adding different things .  But I , I would just say the SEP  is, it\u2019s a summary .  It\u2019s one device .  It\u2019s not going to include all of the things that we look at .  I think you know the things that we look at \u2014we,  we talk about them all the time .  So we \u2019re not actually looking actively at significantly broadening those indicators in the SEP right now\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the forecast overall .  You \u2019re forecasting a very low unemployment rate next year and in 2023, you have inflation \u2014or, the Fed overall is, in the SEP, forecasting inflation at or above 2 percent by 2023, yet no rate hike in any of this \u2014in any of this forecast horizon .  So is this telling us that we could see a higher inflation rate than was projected ?  Or do you not \u2014as you\u2019 ve been talking about, is the unemployment rate insufficient?  Or what is this telling us about the Fed\u2019 s reaction function, that it seems you \u2019re meeting the Fed \u2019s dual mandate by 2023, yet , again , no rate hike  expected \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I guess the first thing to say is that the , the SEP is not a Committee forecast .  It\u2019s, it\u2019s not something we sit around and debate and discuss and approve, and say , \u201cThis represent s our, you know, our reaction function as a C ommittee .\u201d  It\u2019s a compilation of projections from different people .  And I \u2014since we don \u2019t debate it or discuss it, it would be hard for me to say why \u2014exactly why each participant did what they were going to do.     So all I would say about this is that we \u2019ve\u2014we  laid out what I think is very clear guidance on liftoff .  And it \u2019s really three things:  labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of maximum employment\u2014a nd, as I mentioned, we consider a  wide range of indicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate ; inflation that has reached 2  percent, and not just on a transitory basis ; and inflation that \u2019s on track to run moderately above 2 percent for some time .  The fi rst two of those three are very much data based;  the third does have a little bit of a\u2014of an element of expectations in it .  So we are very much determined to implement this guidance in a robust way.  It is the guidance that we chose carefully to implement our new framework .  And to meet these standards , we\u2019ll need to see data, as I mentioned . So what does \u2014what does  this, this SEP really say ?  It says that we\u2019 re committed to our framework and to the guidance we \u2019ve provided to implement that framework .  We will wait until the requirements set forth in that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our policy rate .  And the last thing I \u2019ll say is this:   The state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain, a nd I woul dn\u2019t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future .  So that \u2019s how I would think about the, the SEP\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chairman Powell .  My question is tw ofold.  One, how high are you comfortable letting inflation rise ?  There , there  is some ambiguity in, in your new target, as you mentioned, \u201c expectations driven .\u201d  And, and do you think that that ambiguity might cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation than the Fed actually has, thereby causing financial conditions to tighten prematurely?  Is that a concern ?  Thanks .  \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So we \u2019ve said we\u2019 d like to see inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time .  And we \u2019ve resisted, ba sically, generally, the temptation to try to quantify that .  Part of that just is , talking about inflation is one thing;  actually having inflation run above 2 percent is the real thing.  So I\u2014you know, over the years we \u2019ve, we\u2019ve  talked about 2 percent inflation as a goal, but we haven \u2019t achieved it .  So I , I would say we \u2019d like to, you know, perform .  That \u2019s what we \u2019d really like to do, is to get inflation moderately above 2 percent . I don\u2019 t want to be too specific about what tha t means, because I think it \u2019s hard to do that .  And we haven\u2019 t done it yet .  You know, when we \u2019re actually above 2 percent, we can do that .  I\u2014look, I , I would say this .  The fundamental change in, in our framework is that we, we\u2019re not going to act preemp tively based on forecasts for the most part .  And we \u2019re going to wait to see actual data.  And I think it will take people time to , to adjust to that \u2014and to adjust to that new practice.  And the only way we can really build the credibility of that is by doing it .  So that \u2019s how I would think about that \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News .  So there \u2019s a widespread presumption at this point that the U.S . will reach herd immunity sometime this year .  And all along, you\u2019 ve said that the path of the economy is going to be determined by the course of the virus .  I\u2019m curious, based on the projections that you released today that show unemployment will still be above  estimates of maximum employment through the end of next year and perhaps sometime into 2023, do you think policymakers need to be doing more here to sort of align the herd immunity and full employment timelines, if you will?  Thank you.  \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, on, on herd immunity, I, I\u2019m really going to leave that question to the experts .  We don\u2019 t control that.  We\u2019 re not responsible for defining it .  And we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll leave that whole discussion to the experts .  I mean, we\u2019re \u2014what we \u2019re focused on is , is the part that we control, which is the support that we provide to the economy.  And there we \u2019ve provided very clear guidance.  And in the case of asset purchases, it \u2019s at their current level until we make substantial further progress .  There is an element of j udgment in that , and we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll\u2014therefore , we\u2019ll  supply clear communication well in advance of , of actually tapering, and we just went through, you know, the , the criteria for raising interest rates .  They \u2019re very specific.  And, you know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  very much committed to having them fulfilled robustly.  I, I would agree with you that the , the path of the virus continues to be very important .  We, we  have these, you know, new strains with \u2014which , which can be quite virulent .  And we \u2019re not actually done yet .  And I, I \u2014we \u2019re clearly on a good path with, with  cases coming down, as I mentioned, but we \u2019re not done .  And I \u2019d hate to see us take our eye off the ball before we actually finish the job.  So that \u2019s how I would look at that \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  If I could just briefly follow up , how do you see sort of the disconnect in terms of an economy that is expected to be widely reopened this year but full employment taking longer to achieve ?  Is it , is it the case that factors related to the virus will still be with us over the coming years ?  Is that how to interpret the forecasts \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I think there \u2019s some of that .  Sure, there \u2019ll be some of that.  There will still be some social distancing .  People may be, for example, going in to spaces that, that , you know, that involve close contact with others .  Some people will do that right away.  Others will hold back.  And so I think there \u2019ll\u2014there\u2019ll be some of that .    In addition, though, remember, there are \u2014there are 10 million people \u2014in the range of 10 million people who need to get back to work.  And it \u2019s going to take some time for that to happen.  You know, it can\u2014it can  happen maybe , maybe  more quickly than it has in the past, because it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy, as opposed to stimulating aggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers .  This could be a different sort of a process .  And it co uld be quicker .  We don \u2019t know that .  But it\u2019 s, it\u2019s just a lot of people who have \u2014who need to get back to work.  And it \u2019s not going to happen overnight .  It would be \u2014it\u2019s going to take some time .  No matter how well the economy performs, unemployment will  take quite a time to go \u2014to go  down, and so will participation.  So that \u2019s all I can say .  I think the faster the better;  we\u2019d love to see it come sooner rather than later.  We\u2019d welcome nothing more than that .  But , realistically, given the numbers, it \u2019s going to take some  time \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, thank you.  I wonder if you could\u2014kind of a three -parter here, but all related .  Would you comment on the current level of the 10- year yield and some other lo ng rates out there , whether or not you think they would have a negative effect on the economy?  And , if not, is there a level that would give you concern?  And, finally, the third part:  Other central bankers have expressed concern about what \u2019s happened to yields in their countries and even some taken action, but not you .  Could you give us your general idea or orientation towards the idea of , of coming into the market and affecting a particular tenor of the bond market ?  Do \u2014do you like that idea ?  Do you not like it ?  Is it at the top of your toolbox, or is it something that you think is at the bottom of the toolbox?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Sure .  So we m onitor a broad range of financial conditions , and we\u2019re always attentive to market developments, of course .  We\u2019re still a long way from our goals , and it\u2019s important that financial conditions do remain accommodative to support the achievement of those goa ls.  And if you look at various indexes of financial conditions, what you\u2019ll see is that they generally do show financial conditions overall to be highly accommodative .  And that is appropriate .  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  how we look at it . I would add, as I \u2019ve said, I would be concerned by disorderly conditions in markets or by a persistent tightening of financial conditions that threaten the achievement of our goals .  We think the stance of our \u2014of monetary policy remains appropriate .  Our guidance on the federal funds rate and on asset purchases is providing strong support for the economy.  And we \u2019re committed to maintaining that patiently accommodative stance until the job is well and truly  done \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Could , could you give us an idea of how you sort of  feel about that tool, of being able to come into a particular part of the market and either operating\u2014 doing an Operation T wist or something like that?  Is that something you feel to be the top of your toolbox or something that you don\u2019 t really prefer?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, we \u2014the tools we have are the tools we have.  What I \u2019m telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe , is appropriate .  We think that our asset purchases in their current form \u2014which is to say, you know, across the curve , $80 billion in Treasuries, $40 billion in mortgage -backed securities on net \u2014we think that that \u2019s, that\u2019s  the right place for our asset purchases.  Now , we can \u2014we can  change them, of course, in, in a number of different dimensions should we deem that that\u2019 s appropriate .  But , for now, we think that our policy stance on that is appropriate .  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  You\u2019ve spoken about the pa ndemic \u2019s disproportionate toll on B lack Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and other groups in the labor market .  And I \u2019m curious if you can speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have persistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans .  And, relatedly, since you\u2019ve described vaccines as key to the economic recovery, is the Fed concerned about lower vaccination rates in communities of color?  And what barriers do you think exist there?  Thanks very much.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, which measures.  So we, we do monitor and communicate very regularly about different labor market\u2014disparities in the labor market, let \u2019s say .  So the African American unemployment rate is substantially elevated, and so is the Hispanic unemployment rate.  So we look at those and we see those as, you know \u2014it\u2019 s, it\u2019s slack in the labor market.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s sad to see, because those disparities had real ly come down to record lows since we started keeping the data that way .  As recently as a year ago , February of last year, we had those , those  disparities quite low .  What happens in a downturn, though, is they move up at twice the speed of white unemploym ent.  So we monitor those things . We\u2014our tools, of course, affect unemployment generally, but we \u2019re going to look at those as, as  a form of slack in the labor market and hope that, you know, that  there \u2019s progress there .  And , and this particular downturn, of course, was just a direct hit on , on a part of the economy that employs many minorities and lower -paid workers .  The public -facing workers in the service industries in many cases don \u2019t have a lot of financial assets , they\u2019re not tremendously well paid , they might have other jobs , and things like that .  So this was a direct hit on that part of    the economy.  And it \u2019s the slowest part of the economy to recover .  So, you know, we \u2019d like to see those people continue to get supported, you know, as  we\u2014as the br oader economy recovers, which , which it\u2019 s very much doing now . In terms of disparate levels of vaccination, that\u2019s \u2014those are facts and unfortunate facts.  They \u2019re really not something we , we have within our policy toolkit to address .  But it is \u2014it is  true, though, that the data we have suggests that there are \u2014there are significant disparities between different ethnic groups and \u2014you know, but that \u2019s, that\u2019s  not for us .  That \u2019s for fiscal authorities and the government more generally to, to  work on\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hey, Chair Powell .  Thanks for taking our questions .  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the fiscal policy support that has come down the line affecting the economy \u2019s potential in the  longer term, just in the sense that you\u2019 ve talked a lot about the potential for labor market scarring and how that might weigh on our , sort of, future prospects .  And I wonder whether you see that sort of working in reverse .  You know, if we put people back into the labor market more quickly, does that improve our chances \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to avoid much of the scarring that we were very, very concerned about at the beginning.  And I think that \u2019s just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered\u2014you know, with the CARES Act and since then, has \u2014is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full employment .  It\u2019s going to make a huge difference in people \u2019s lives .  And it has already. As I mentioned in my remarks \u2014opening remarks, the recovery has been faster than we expected .  Part of that just is , it\u2019s very hard to predict, given we \u2019ve never seen an event like this.  But part of it is just the strength of th e fiscal response, which I think will, will look good over the    years.  Longer  term, you know, to, to really \u2014that\u2019s \u2014the first part of it is about avoiding scarring, and I think we \u2019ve not avoided all of the scarring , but we \u2019ve probably avoided the worst cases there.  And, and I hope we keep at it, and we will keep at it with our policies, of course , to do whatever we can to make sure that\u2019s \u2014that continues . Longer  term though, what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour worked, to rai se living standards over time, is investment :  investment in people \u2019s skills and aptitudes, investment in plant and equipment, investment in software .  It takes a lot of investment to, to support a more productive economy and raise living standards .  And t hat\u2019s \u2014you know, that hasn\u2019 t been the principal focus with these measures\u2014our measures, certainly .  And w e don\u2019 t have those tools .  But what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and beginning to, you know, support people as the economy returns to normal .  But there should be a focus on\u2014a longer -term focus , I think , would be healthy on, on the investment front \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Chair Powell .  I wanted to ask a question about the e uro zone .  While the outlook for the U.S . economy has much improved, progress in the euro zone has been far less encouraging .  And it \u2019s showing signs of serious weakness due , due  to the slower vaccination rollout and renewed lockdowns and restrictions .  How worried are you about transatlantic economic divergence and the possibility that , that  trouble in the e uro zone  and weakness in the euro zone could, could drag down the U.S. recovery as it did, in a way , in the aftermath of the financial crisis \n\nCHAIR POWELL: You \u2019re right that the pace of the recovery is that we \u2019re having diverging recoveries here, as we did after the last crisis.  And in this case, as well as the other one, the U.S.\u2019 s recovery is, is  leading the global recovery.  And, you know, we conduct policy,    of course, here .  Our , our focus is on \u2014our, you know \u2014our, our objectives are domestic ones.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s maximum employment and price stability here in the United States .  We monitor developments abroad, and we know \u2014because they know we know that they can \u2014those can affect our outcomes .  So I think U.S. demand\u2014very strong U.S . demand, if, if\u2014as the economy improves is going to support global activity as well over time .  That, that \u2019ll be through imports .  And, you know, when the U.S . economy is strong, that strength tends to be \u2014tends to support global , global  activity as well.  So that \u2019s one thing. I don\u2019 t\u2014I don\u2019t  worry in the near term.  I mean, I \u2019d love to see Europe growing faster .  I\u2019d love to see the vacci ne rollout going more smoothly.  But I don\u2019 t worry too much about us in the near term, because we\u2019 re, we\u2019re  on a very good track.  Very strong fiscal support coming, now vaccination going quickly, a nd cases coming down .  I think we \u2019re\u2014I think we\u2019re  in a good place.  It\u2019s all ahead of us , but the data should, should get stronger fairly quickly here and remain strong for some time here \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, thanks so much for taking our questions .  I wanted to ask if the  Fed is planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases \u2014I\u2019m sorry, share repurchases that are currently in place into the second quarter , and if you\u2019 re considering at all the scenario analysis and midcycle stress tests t hat were in place last year, this year.  And , kind of , what would make you consider doing something like that again?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So we haven\u2019 t made a decision on that .  We\u2019 re a couple weeks away from announcing that decision.  I , I won\u2019t foreshadow it here today.  I will say , we\u2019re going to continue our data -driven approach.  You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends , so the firms are preserving capital .  Through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital    and their level of reserves.  And the December stress test s showed that banks are strong and well capitalized under our hypothetical recessions that we\u2014that we  used in December, which were quite stringent . We\u2019re right in the middle of our 2021 stress tests , and we \u2019ll release those results before the end of June .  And that layer s, you know, very significant additional stress on top of the stress the banks have already absorbed over the past year, with the unemployment rate going to 11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent .  So\u2014but all of that, you know, the results of the stress test s and the decision on distributions \u2014all of that is to come fairly soon, as I mentioned.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking these questions .  You laid out the standards to lift off.  And back in June of 2020, you said, you know, you\u2019 re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates .  But I see seven members seeing liftoff in 2023 and 4 next year .  How, how  much debate \u2014and how can you characterize that conversation \u2014has there been about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, you know, it all depends .  We\u2019 ve set out very clear criteria for liftoff, right,  where we\u2019 ve said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of, of  maximum employment .  And that doesn\u2019 t just mean unemployment, it means a much broader set of criteria .  We want inflation at 2 percent , and not on a transitory basis .  And  we want inflation on track to be moderately \u2014to run moderately above 2 percent for some time .  Those are the three conditions .  Everybody on the C ommittee agrees to that, right?  So it comes down to, what \u2019s your projection for the economy ?  If you want to\u2014i f you want to \u2014you know, people will have a range of , of assessments for how good the economy is    going to be .  And, you know, we , we don\u2019 t\u2014I would say that we \u2019re in a relatively highly uncertain situation.  If you look at the uncertainty, people , people  on the Committee broadly say that uncertainty about the forecast is , is very high compared to the normal level .  We haven \u2019t come out of a pandemic before .  We haven \u2019t had this kind of fiscal support before, totaling it all up.  So you\u2019 re going to have differe nt perspectives from C ommittee participants about how fast growth will be, how fast the labor market will hea l, or how fast \u2014sorry, inflation will move up.  And those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of liftoff . Of course, thi s isn\u2019t a decision to lift off now .  We \u2019ll make that decision then .  But it \u2019s an estimate based on \u2014based on assumptions about growth.  And it \u2019s, it\u2019s meant to be a tool to generally show the public how , how  our objective function works, how we think about the future .  It isn \u2019t meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off.  We\u2014you know, we \u2019re not going to make that decision for some time .  The  chances are that the economy in that time  and place will be very different from the one we think it \u2019ll be. So I\u2014sometimes with the dots, I have to be sure to point out that they\u2014 they\u2019re not a Committee forecast .  And you know this, but it\u2019s\u2014they\u2019 re not a C ommittee forecast .  It\u2019s just compiling t hese projections, really , of individual people .  We think it serves a useful purpose .  It\u2019s not meant to , to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the C ommittee will act.  That will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hey there, Chairman Powell .  I wanted to elaborate a little bit on your commentary about the fiscal stimulus .  So it sounds like you, I guess, see the case for even maybe mor e investment, at least from Congress , to support the more productive economy, as you answer ed to Jeanna\u2019s question.  So we just had $1.9 trillion dollars in spending.  So where do    you see the fiscal space right now ?  Do you still, I guess, maybe see the country in a place right now where it wouldn\u2019 t be a concern if there were to be more spending at this time \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, Brian, it \u2019s not up to us to decide what , what  Congress should spend money on or when.  I was answering Jeanna\u2019s question, which r eally was, how do we assure lack of damage to \u2014scarring , for example, or lack of damage to the productive capacity of the economy?  And I think what \u2019s happened so far has done a pretty good job of that .  But, really, I wanted to make the longer -run point th at if\u2014to work on the productivity\u2014on productivity  over longer periods, that is\u2014that is \u2014comes down to a number of things .  But one of those things is investment :  investment in people, in their skills, education, aptitude, all of those things . I\u2019m not in an y way suggesting that that \u2019s something Congress should work on right now .  Or that, you know, that \u2019s just not my\u2014that\u2019s not our job.  I \u2019m just saying , that, that is what fiscal policy can do that , really , monetary policy can\u2019 t do\u2014is, is invest in the future productive capacity of the economy, raise potential growth .  Those things are completely tools that Congress has.  And , again, I wasn \u2019t making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you for taking my question.  I just wanted to get your\u2014an updated view on your sense of your view on financial stability risks and whether or not you see any pockets of excess out in financial markets that concern you, either , you know,  specifically to that, that area of the market or as in terms of, like , the threat that it could p ose to\u2014propose to the overall economy\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Sure.  So, as you know, financial stability for us is , is a framework .  It\u2019s not one thing.  It \u2019s not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that.  It\u2019s a    framework that we , we have .  We report on it semiannually, t he Board gets a report on it quarterly, and we monitor every day.  And it has \u2014it has  four pillars , and those are four key vulnerabilities:  asset valuations, debt owed by businesses and households, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions .  Those four things .  And I\u2019ll just quickly touch on them . So if you look at asset valuations, you can say that by some measures, some asset valuations are elevated compared to history.  I think that\u2019 s clear .  In terms of households and businesses, households entered the , the crisis in very good shape by historical standards .  Leverage in the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the \u2014since the financial crisis .  Now, there was\u2014 there was some negative effects on that, people lost their jobs and that sort of thing , but they \u2019ve also gotten a lot of support now .  So the damage hasn \u2019t been as , as bad as we thought .  Businesses, by the same token, had a high debt load coming in.  And \u2014but \u2014and many saw their revenues decline.  But there\u2019s\u2014 they\u2019ve done so much financing, and there \u2019s a lot of cash on their balance sheet .  So nothing in those two sectors really jumps out as really troubling.  Short term \u2014I mentioned funding risk as the \u2014as the last one.  So we saw , again, in this crisis, breakdowns in parts of the short -term funding markets \u2014came under a tremendous amount of stress.  And they\u2019 ve been quiet since the spring .  And , you know, we shut down our facilities and all  of that.  But we , we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019t  feel like we can let the moment pass without just saying again that we \u2014that those \u2014some aspects of the short -term funding markets and , more  broadly, nonbank financial intermediation didn\u2019 t hold up so well under great stress \u2014under tremendous stress .  And we need to go back and look at that .  So a very high priority for us as regulators and supervisors is going to be to go back\u2014and this , this  will involve all the other regulatory agencies ; it does involve  all of them as well\u2014and see if we can strengthen those    things .  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a\u2014sort of a broader , detailed look.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chair man, can you help me understand something about the , the SEP and your forecasts ?  The inflation that you\u2019 re talking about for this year , you say, is \u201ctransitory .\u201d  Then , by 2023, you\u2019 re back down to 2.1 percent .  There \u2019s no forecast for a rate increase for  2023.  If you get to 3\u00bd percent unemployment but inflation is only at 2 or 2.1 percent, are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there \u2014or, roughly zero going forward from there ?  In other words, could we be in a Japan- like situation where  rates just stay low because inflation does \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, again , I wouldn\u2019 t read too much into, into the, the March 2021 SEP dot plot .  Remember what it is :  It\u2019s a compilation of individual projections by individual members .  They \u2019re all making different assessments.  They , they have different forecasts, economic forecasts.  Some have more optimistic ones, some less optimistic.  And  they\u2019re \u2014also remember that the SEP doesn \u2019t actually include all the things that go into maximum employment .  Right ?  It\u2019s, it\u2019s only \u2014it only includes unemployment . So I, I would just say, we \u2019ve set out clear guidance .  The \u2014the message from the SEP that I would like to leave with people is , we set out clear guidance .  I mentioned what it was .  It\u2019s inflation up t o\u2014no, sorry, it \u2019s, it\u2019s labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of maximum employment \u2014and that \u2019s not just unemployment, it \u2019s all the other indicators, but , overall, totaling up to maximum employment ; it\u2019s inflation at 2 percent , and not on a transient basis;  and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for \u2014moderately for some time .  Those are the criteria .  We \u2019re committed to robustly implementing that guidance .    And that \u2019s what this \u2014that\u2019s what this  says.  T hat\u2019s really all it says .  We \u2019re going to wait until those requirements are met.  And , again, you know, the , the state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain .  And I wouldn\u2019 t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far in to the future \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  If I could follow up , I\u2019m just wondering\u2014before 2019, I would say you were focused on the problems with having interest rates too low .  Now are you saying we\u2019re willing to live with it until we reach these goals even if you get\u2014meet your  goal on maximum employment \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So what I would say is , we\u2019re committed to giving the economy the support that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of maximum employment and price stability .  And, you know, to the extent having r ates low and support for monetary policy broadly, to the extent that raises other questions, we think it \u2019s absolutely essential to maintain the strength and stability of the \u2014of the  broader financial system and to carefully monitor financial stability quest ions if that \u2019s what you\u2019 re getting at .  You know, we , we do that .  We wi ll\u2014we  monitor them very carefully . I, I would point out that , over the long expansion \u2014the longest in U.S . history, 10 years and 8 months \u2014rates were very low  for\u2014they were at zero for, you know, 7 years a nd then\u2014and then never got above, you know, 2.4 percent, roughly.  During that , we didn\u2019 t see, actually , excess buildup of debt .  We didn\u2019 t see asset prices form into bubbles that would threaten the progress of the economy.  We didn\u2019 t see the things you\u2014we didn\u2019 t see a housing bubble .  You know, the things that have tended to really hurt an economy and have in recent history hurt the U.S., we didn\u2019 t see them build up despite very low rates .  Part of that just is that you\u2019 re in a low -rate environment, you \u2019re in a much lower rate environment , and the  connection between low    rates and the kind of financial instability issues is just not as tight as people think it is . That\u2019s not to say we ignore it .  We don \u2019t ignore it.  We, we  watch it very carefully .  And we don\u2019t think\u2014we think there is a connection.  We say there is, but it \u2019s not quite so clear .  We actually monitor financial conditions very, very broadly and carefully.  And we didn\u2019 t do that before the Global F inancial C risis 12 years ago .  Now we do .  And we \u2019ve also, you know, put a lot of time and effort into strengthening the large financial institutions that form the core of our financial system\u2014are much stronger, much more resilient.  That \u2019s true of the ban ks.  I think it \u2019s true of the CCPs .  We want it to be true of , of other nonbank financial intermediation, markets , and, and institutions . So I think that \u2019s, that\u2019s \u2014you know, monetary policy should be , to me , for, for achieving our macroeconomic aims .  Fina ncial regulatory policy and supervision should be for strengthening the financial system so that it is strong and robust and can withstand the kinds of things that it couldn\u2019 t, frankly\u2014a nd we learned that in 2008, \u201909, \u201910.  This time around, the regulated  part of the financial system held up very well .  We, we  found some other areas that need strengthening, and that \u2019s what we \u2019re working on now \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks for taking my question.

Is that\u2014 is that the question?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Yes, exactly \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ok ay\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If they offset each other\u2014 the persistent pandemic unemployment \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Ye s, I think I \u2019m hearing you correctly.  So I would say a couple things .  There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation .  That time is long gone .  We had extremely low unemployment  in, in\u2014not extremely low.  We had low unemployment in 2018 and \u2019 19 and the beginning of \u201920 without having troubling inflation at all.  We were at 3.5 percent .  We were bouncing around with unemployment 3.5 percent to 4 percent .  And it wasn \u2019t just unemployment.  Participation was high, wages were moving up.  It was a very healthy thing.  And we didn\u2019 t see price inflation move up.  There is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment .  But that has not \u2014what , what  happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather tha n raising prices .  And that seems to be a feature of late -cycle behavior .  So we\u2019re, we \u2019re not \u2014when , when we \u2014when we  seek to achieve low unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, you know, we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation.  \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  As you know, households , households  are sitting on a lot of excess savings.  And I wonder if , combined with that , you have an unl eashing of, you know, pent-up demand.  How much do you think that would affect \u2014that would affect  inflation ?  And would you expect that to be transitory?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  We, you know, we and everyone who\u2019 s forecasting these\u2014what , what  we\u2019re all doing is , we are looking at the \u2014at the  amount of savings .  We\u2019re looking at \u2014you    know, we have reasonably good data on that .  And we \u2019re looking at the government transfers that\u2019ll be made as part of the various laws.  And we \u2019re trying to make an assessment on what w ill be the tendency of people to spend that money, the marginal propensity to consume .  And from that, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring, and , ultimately , on inflation .  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  what we \u2019re all doing . And we have, you know, we have \u2014we can look at history, and we can make estimates, and those are all very transparent and public .  And you can compare one to the other .  And, of course, we \u2019ve all \u2014we\u2019ve all  done that .  And I think we \u2019ve made very conservative assumptions and sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process.  And what , what  it comes down to is what I said before, which is , there very likely will be a step -up in inflation as March and April of last year drop out of the 12- month window, because they were very low inflation numbers .  That \u2019s a\u2014 that\u2019ll be a fairly significant pop in inflation .  It\u2019ll wear off quickly , though, because it \u2014just the way the numbers are calculated . Past that, as the economy reopens, people will start spending mor e, and then, you know, you can only go out to dinner once per night, but a lot of people can go out to dinner .  And so \u2014and they\u2019 re not doing that now .  They \u2019re not going to restaurants, not going to theaters .  That part of the economy\u2014and travel and hotels \u2014that part of the economy is , is really not functioning at , at full capacity, right?  But as that happens, people can start to spend .  It\u2019s also\u2014wouldn\u2019 t be surprising if \u2014and you\u2019 re seeing this now, particularly in the goods economy\u2014there \u2019ll be bottlenecks.  They won\u2019 t be\u2014they won\u2019t be  able to service all of the demand maybe , maybe  for a period.  So those things could lead to\u2014and we \u2019ve, we\u2019ve  modeled that .  Other people have too.  We\u2019ve\u2014and w hat we see is relatively modest increases in inflation .  So\u2014but those are not permanent things .    You know, what \u2019ll, what\u2019ll  happen is \u2014the supply side \u2014the supply side  in the United States is very dynamic .  People start businesses, they , they reopen restaurants, you know, the airlines are, will be flying again, all of those things will happen.  And so it \u2019ll turn out to be a one\u2014a one -time sort of bulge in , in prices, but it won\u2019 t change inflation going forward, because inflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent .  We know that inflation dynamics do evolve over time .  And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up.  And, and that time is not now .  That hasn \u2019t been the case for some decades.  And we think it won\u2019t \u2014it won\u2019t\u2014we won \u2019t suddenly change to another regime . These things tend to change over time .  And they tend to\u2014 tend to change when the central bank doesn \u2019t understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the key to it all .  The, the \u2014having them anchored at 2 percent is what gives us the ab ility to push hard when the economy \u2019s really weak .  If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above 2 percent, of course, we would conduct policy in a way that would, would make sure that that didn\u2019 t happen.  We\u2019 re committed to having inflation ex pectations anchored at 2 percent, not materially above or below 2 percent . So that \u2019s\u2014I think  if you \u2014if you look at the savings, look at all of that, model it, that \u2019s, that\u2019s  kind of what comes out of our assessment .  There are different possibilities .  I think it \u2019s, it\u2019s a relatively unusual \u2014very unusual situation to have all these savings  and this , this  amount of fiscal support and monetary policy support .  Nonetheless, that , that  is our most likely case .  And you know, as the \u2014as the data come in  and the economy performs , we\u2019ll of course adjust .  Our outcome -based guidance will immediately adapt, we think, to meet whatever the actual path of the economy is.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks, Chairman Powell .

And what do you expect them to do to prices in, in\u2014just in the short run?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, I have to say, I think it \u2019s impossible to say , frankly , with any confidence, but I , I would expect it \u2019s very possible \u2014let\u2019s put it that way \u2014that you will see bottlenecks emerge and then clear over time.  And you\u2019 ll probably see that over a period of time, because, you know, really, the , the strong data are ahead of us .  You know, you\u2019re, you\u2019re \u2014right now the,  the checks are going out just , just  now .  And t hat\u2019ll, that\u2019ll add to spending.  COVID cases are coming down .  Vaccination is moving , now, quickly.  You know, the , the really strong economic data is coming .  It should be coming, assuming we stay on this track.  And that \u2019s when you\u2019ll really know where , where  the bottlenecks are.  But you can see, though, that they\u2019 re not \u2014these are not permanent .  It\u2019s not like the supply side will be unable to adapt to these things .  It will\u2014t he market will clear.  It just may take some time.  And , and some of the answer to that may be price .  In many cases, it won \u2019t be price .  You \u2019ll see that people are reluctant to raise prices .  You know, it \u2019s a little bit the story about, you know, the wage \u2014the wage  Phillips curve  does show that as unemployment goes down, wages move up.  But companies choose not to try to, to  pass that , that  price increase along to their customers .  So you\u2019 ll see a lot of that here too, I think .  Anyway, we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll  see.  But that\u2019s, that\u2019s  my basic , basic sense.  Thank you very much.\n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 5, "dovish": 32, "neutral": 19}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 0, "dovish": 1, "neutral": 25}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 5, "dovish": 33, "neutral": 44}, "speech_summary": "In the midst of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve acknowledges the crucial role of healthcare providers and essential workers, while also recognizing the clear danger to the US economy. Congress and the Federal Reserve swiftly responded with significant fiscal support and the deployment of various tools to ensure a strong recovery and limit lasting damage, resulting in the avoidance of the worst economic outcomes.The FOMC has decided to maintain near-zero interest rates and continue with sizable asset purchases to provide ongoing support to the economy until the recovery is fully achieved. While there have been positive developments, it is important to remain cautious as the path of the economy still depends on the virus and measures taken to control its spread.Household spending on services, particularly in sectors that require close gathering, such as travel and hospitality, remains low. However, the housing sector, business investment, and manufacturing production have recovered, and the overall economic recovery is attributed to unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies. Despite progress in vaccinations and fiscal policies, employment in the leisure and hospitality sector is still significantly below pre-pandemic levels, with the economy as a whole experiencing a 9.5 million shortfall in employment. The unemployment rate of 6.2 percent in February understates the employment shortfall, as labor market participation remains notably below pre-pandemic levels.FOMC participants expect the unemployment rate to decrease gradually, with projections of 4.5 percent by the end of this year and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023. The economic downturn has disproportionately affected lower-wage workers, African Americans, and Hispanics, causing uncertainty about the future, while overall inflation remains below the 2 percent objective.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) emphasizes the importance of achieving maximum employment and maintaining inflation expectations at 2 percent in order to achieve long-term economic stability. They plan to maintain an accommodative monetary policy until these goals are met, including keeping interest rates low and increasing holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.Overall, the Federal Reserve emphasizes that their interest rate and balance sheet tools are effectively supporting the economy and will continue to do so. They acknowledge the impact of their actions on communities, families, and businesses nationwide, emphasizing their commitment to using all available tools to ensure a strong recovery from this challenging period.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': How do the forecasts for 2021 align with the definition of \"substantial further progress\" and is it time to discuss tapering?\n'ANSWER': We will continue asset purchases until we see actual progress, not just forecast progress. We want to see substantial progress in labor market conditions and inflation towards our goals. We will provide advance notice before any decision to taper, based on actual data suggesting progress.", "'QUESTION': Why wouldn't the shift in the dots suggest a weakening of the commitment?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell doesn't see it that way. The Committee has a range of perspectives and they debate and discuss before coming to a solution. The majority of the Committee is not showing a rate increase during this forecast period, but as data improves, forecasts may change. They want to see actual data rather than just a forecast before making any decisions.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy when the reserve supply is large, and do you think changes to the leverage ratio, including the SLR, are the solution?\n\n'ANSWER': We will have an announcement on that in the coming days. I won't provide further details at this time. Feel free to ask another question.", "'QUESTION': Are you considering adding more indicators to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) to project the unemployment rate?\n'ANSWER': The SEP currently only includes the unemployment rate, which is an insufficient statistic. We consider a broad range of indicators, such as labor force participation, employment to population ratio, wages, job flows, and disparities among different groups. While we may occasionally consider adding different indicators, the SEP is a summary and cannot include all the indicators we look at.", "QUESTION: Does the low unemployment rate and projected inflation in the Fed's forecast indicate a higher inflation rate or a change in the Fed's reaction function?\n\nANSWER: The SEP is not a Committee forecast, but a compilation of projections from different people. The Fed has clear guidance on liftoff, which includes labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, inflation reaching 2 percent, and inflation running moderately above 2 percent. The state of the economy in the future is uncertain, so the exact timing of a potential rate increase should not be focused on.", "'QUESTION': How high are you comfortable letting inflation rise and could the ambiguity in your new target cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation?\n'ANSWER': We would like to see inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time, but we have resisted quantifying it. The goal is to actually achieve inflation above 2 percent, which we haven't done yet. Our fundamental change is that we won't act preemptively based on forecasts, but wait for actual data. It will take time for people to adjust to this new practice.", "'QUESTION': Do you think policymakers need to be doing more to align the herd immunity and full employment timelines?\n'ANSWER': We don't control herd immunity and leave that to the experts. Our focus is on providing support to the economy. We have clear guidance on asset purchases and will communicate well in advance of tapering. The path of the virus is still important and we shouldn't lose focus before finishing the job.", "'QUESTION': How do you see the disconnect between an economy expected to reopen this year and achieving full employment taking longer?\n'ANSWER': There will still be factors related to the virus, such as social distancing, that will impact the speed of recovery. Additionally, around 10 million people need to get back to work, and it will take time for that to happen. Unemployment and participation will take quite a while to decrease, despite the economy's performance.", "QUESTION: Could you comment on the current level of long-term yields and their potential impact on the economy? Are there any levels that would concern you? What is your stance on central banks intervening in the bond market?\nANSWER: We monitor financial conditions and believe they should remain accommodative to support our goals. While we would be concerned about disorderly market conditions or persistent tightening of financial conditions, we believe our current monetary policy stance is appropriate and provides strong support for the economy. We are committed to maintaining this accommodative stance until our goals are achieved.", "'QUESTION': Could you give us an idea of how you feel about the tool of operating in a particular part of the market, such as doing an Operation Twist?\n'ANSWER': The tools we have are the tools we have. Our current stance of monetary policy, including asset purchases across the curve, is appropriate. We can change them if necessary, but for now, we believe our policy stance is appropriate.", "'QUESTION': Can you speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups with higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans? Is the Fed concerned about lower vaccination rates in communities of color and what barriers exist there?\n\n'ANSWER': We monitor and communicate regularly about disparities in the labor market, such as the elevated unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics. These disparities indicate slack in the labor market. The Fed's tools affect unemployment generally, but we hope to see progress in reducing these disparities. Disparate levels of vaccination are unfortunate facts, but addressing them is not within our policy toolkit. It is the responsibility of fiscal authorities and the government to work on these issues.", "'QUESTION': How does the fiscal policy support affect the economy's potential in the longer term and can putting people back into the labor market quickly improve our chances?\n\n'ANSWER': Fiscal policy has helped avoid significant scarring and will accelerate the return to full employment. The size and speed of Congress' response has already made a positive impact on the recovery. However, long-term improvement in productive capacity and living standards requires investment in skills, equipment, and software, which has not been the focus of current measures. A longer-term focus on investment would be beneficial.", "'QUESTION': How worried are you about transatlantic economic divergence and the possibility that trouble in the euro zone could drag down the U.S. recovery?\n'ANSWER': The U.S. recovery is leading the global recovery, and strong U.S. demand will support global activity over time. While Chair Powell would like to see Europe growing faster and a smoother vaccine rollout, he is not worried about the near-term impact on the U.S. recovery due to the strong fiscal support, quick vaccination progress, and declining cases.", "'QUESTION': Is the Fed planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases into the second quarter and considering scenario analysis and midcycle stress tests?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has not made a decision yet and will announce it in a couple of weeks. They will continue their data-driven approach and have seen banks increase their capital and reserves in 2020. The 2021 stress test results will be released before the end of June.", "'QUESTION': How much debate has there been about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled?\n'ANSWER': The debate revolves around different projections for the economy, with varying assessments of how fast growth, labor market healing, and inflation will occur. The estimates of liftoff are not a decision to lift off now, but rather a tool to show the public how the Federal Reserve thinks about the future. The actual decision will depend on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain.", "'QUESTION': Where does Chairman Powell see the fiscal space right now and is it a concern if there were to be more spending at this time?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Powell stated that it is not up to the Federal Reserve to decide what Congress should spend money on or when. He emphasized the importance of investment in people, skills, education, and aptitude for long-term productivity. He clarified that he was not making a comment on the current fiscal setting.", "'QUESTION': What is the Federal Reserve's view on financial stability risks and are there any areas of concern in financial markets?\n'ANSWER': Financial stability is a framework for the Federal Reserve, not focused on specific markets or assets. The four key vulnerabilities are asset valuations, debt levels of businesses and households, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions. While some asset valuations are elevated, households and businesses have been resilient with support measures. Short-term funding markets experienced stress during the crisis, requiring a review and strengthening of regulations.", "'QUESTION': If unemployment reaches 3.5% but inflation remains at 2-2.1%, are you willing to keep rates at zero, leading to a situation like Japan where rates stay low due to low inflation?\n\n'ANSWER': The March 2021 SEP dot plot is a compilation of individual projections with different assessments and economic forecasts. The SEP only includes unemployment, not all indicators of maximum employment. We have set clear guidance for maximum employment and inflation at 2%, not transient, and on track to exceed 2% moderately. We will wait until these requirements are met, and the state of the economy in the future is uncertain.", "QUESTION: Are you willing to live with low interest rates until the goals of maximum employment are met?\n\nANSWER: We are committed to supporting the economy to quickly achieve maximum employment and price stability. While low rates may raise concerns, we believe it is essential to maintain the strength and stability of the financial system. We closely monitor financial stability and have not seen excessive debt or asset bubbles during the previous long expansion with low rates. We acknowledge the connection between rates and financial instability but it is not as clear-cut as perceived. We now monitor financial conditions broadly and have strengthened financial institutions to withstand crises. Monetary policy aims for macroeconomic goals while financial regulation strengthens the system.", "'QUESTION': Could you talk about the relationship between persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in inflation? Does the former offset the latter to some degree?\n'ANSWER': I'm sorry, could you repeat that? You broke up there for a second.", "'QUESTION': Can you hear me now?\n'ANSWER': Yes, yes.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk about the relationship between persistent pandemic unemployment and expected increase in inflation and whether the former offsets the latter, and how closely are you monitoring this?\n\n'ANSWER': The reporter is asking about the relationship between unemployment and inflation and whether one offsets the other. Chair Powell seeks clarification on the question.", "'QUESTION': Can you confirm that the Federal Reserve will continue to support the economy?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell acknowledges the reporter's statement and responds with a simple \"Okay,\" indicating agreement or understanding.", "'QUESTION': Is there still a tight connection between unemployment and inflation?\n'ANSWER': No, the connection between unemployment and inflation has weakened. In 2018 and 2019, we had low unemployment without troubling inflation. When wages increase due to low unemployment, companies have absorbed the cost instead of raising prices. So we can focus on achieving low unemployment without worrying too much about inflation.", "'QUESTION': How much do you think the excess savings and pent-up demand will affect inflation, and do you expect it to be transitory?\n'ANSWER': We are assessing the amount of savings and government transfers, estimating the impact on spending, growth, hiring, and inflation. There will likely be a temporary increase in inflation as low numbers from last year drop out of the 12-month window. As the economy reopens, people will spend more, but it won't have a lasting effect on inflation as supply will adjust and inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': Are supply chain bottlenecks improving or worsening, and how will they affect prices in the short run?\n'ANSWER': It is difficult to say with certainty, but it is possible that bottlenecks will emerge and then clear over time. The strong economic data that is expected to come will reveal where the bottlenecks are. The supply side will be able to adapt, but it may take some time. Price increases may be a factor, but many companies are reluctant to pass them along to customers."]}
