E ven after the economy starts to recover more quickly, even after the unemployment  rate begins to move down more decisively, we \u2019re not going to rush to begin to tighten policy .  We \u2019re going to give it some time to make sure the recovery is well established.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about that same line in the statement .

Secondly, stock prices are up today, so are oil prices and gold.  Why aren \u2019t those part of the same reaction to the Fed \u2019s acts today?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well , our policy approa ch doesn \u2019t involve intentionally trying to raise inflation .  That \u2019s not the objective .  The idea is to make su re we provide enough support so the economy will grow fast enough to bring unemployment down over time .  I mean, September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 7 of 25 as we look back at the last six m onths or so, we \u2019ve seen unemployment at basically the same place it was in January .  We\u2019ve seen not enough jobs growth to bring down the unemployment rate, and what we need to see is more progress .  And that \u2019s what we will be looking at .  In terms of the m id-2015 date, we think by that point that the economy will be recovering, we\u2019ll be providing the support it needs .

We bring inflation back to the target over time , but w e do it in a way that takes into account the deviations of both of our objectives, you know, from their targets . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman .  Earlier this year, on two occasions, the Fed took policy action s, which you defend ed as  extremel y important for the economy , but, as you mentioned, there hasn\u2019 t been any improvement in the labor markets since the beginning of the year .  Why should people believe this  will make a difference?  And the projections seem to suggest it \u2019s approximately a 0. 4 reduction in unemployment .  Is that the limit of what Fed  policies can do going forward? \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well , our assessment \u2014I talked about this at my remarks at Jackson Hole \u2014our assessment , and that of the research literature, is that the polic ies that we \u2019ve undertaken have had real benefits for the economy \u2014that they have provided some support, that they have eased financial conditions and help reduce unemployment .  All tha t being said, September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 8 of 25 monetary policy, as I \u2019ve said many times, is not a panacea.  It\u2019s not by itself able to solve these problems .  We \u2019re looking for policymakers in other areas to do their part .

The 0.4 percent you\u2019re referring to is the change in the forecast between the last projection and this one .  But remember, people make projections  assuming that policy is appropriate .  So some of them may have assumed these policies in their last projections , and not all are assuming these policies in this projection.  So tha t\u2019s probably a little bit of an understatement of what we think we can get .  But in any case, again, I want to be clear that while I think we can make a meaningful and significant contribu tion to this problem \u2014to reducing this problem, we can\u2019 t solve it.  We don\u2019 t have tools that are strong enough to solve the unemployment problem.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  You\u2019ve made an el oquent explanation ove r the past  couple of weeks of the Fed \u2019s ability to lower in terest rates .  But what \u2019s missing for many economists is how the transmission mechanism is going to work .  Most people think this will have a minimal effect  on rates .  Can you give us an idea of how much you think it might push rates down, a nd why moving r ates down a few basis points might change demand, which seems to be the problem in the economy?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, the ultimate effect is going to depen d, of course , on how much we end up doing , and that , in turn, is going to depend on what the economy does .  September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 9 of 25 This is a conditional program ; we\u2019re going to be providing accommodation according to how the economy evolves .  I think that \u2019s the virtue of putting it this way , is that if the economy is weaker, we\u2019ll provide more support ; if the economy st rengthens on its own or other headwinds die  down, then it will require less support .  So the amount of support we provide is going to depend on how the economy evolves .  We do  think that these policies can  bring interest rates down\u2014not just Treasury rates , but a whole range of rates, including mortgage rates and rates for corporate bonds and other types of important interest rates .  It also affects stock prices .  It affects other asset prices \u2014home prices , for example.  So looking at all the different channe ls of effect, we think it does have impact on the economy .  It will have impact on the labor market , but, as again, the way I would describe it is a meaningful effect, a sign ificant effect , but not a panacea, not a solution for the whole issue .  We \u2019re just  trying to get the economy  moving in the right direction , to make sure that we don \u2019t stagnate at high levels of unemployment, that we \u2019re making progress toward s more acceptable l evels of unemployment.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Robin Harding from the Financial Times .

We are trying to create more employment , we are trying to meet our maximum employment mandate, so that \u2019s the objective .  Our tools involve \u2014I mean , the to ols we have involve affecting financial asset prices , and that \u2019s\u2014those are the tools of monetary policy .  There are a number of different channels \u2014mortgage rates, I mentioned other interest rates, corporate bond rates, but also the prices of various assets, like , for example, the prices of homes .  To the extent that home prices begin to rise, consumers will feel wealthier, they\u2019ll feel more disposed to spend.  If house prices are ris ing, people may be more willing to buy homes because they think that they \u2019ll, you know, make a better return on that purchase .  So house prices is one vehicle .  Stock prices \u2014many people own stocks directly or indirectly .  The issue here is whether or not i mproving asset prices generally will make people more willing to spend.  One of the main concerns that firms have is there is not enough demand, there \u2019s not enough people coming and demanding their products .

We\u2019re looking for something that involves unemployment coming down in a sustained way, not necessarily a rapid way , because I don \u2019t know if our tools are that strong, but we \u2019d like to see an economy which is strong enough that it will support improving labor market conditions and unemployment that \u2019s declining gradually over time .  That \u2019s essentially what we\u2019 re looking for .  In terms of the tools that we have, we have the mortgage -backed security purchases , which we can continue or expand or change in any \u2014you know, in various  ways .  We could also purchase , of course , Treasuries ; we\u2019ve retained that capacity .

Did th e Committee consider specific targets \u2014there have been a number of proposals \u2014and why did you choose not to do that?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, we \u2014the problem is that, for this purpose , that what we\u2019re looking for is a general improvement in labor market conditions .

The u nemployment rate came down last month because participation fell .  That \u2019s not necessarily a sign of improvement .  So we want to see more jobs .  We want to see lower unemployment .  We want to see a stronger economy that can cause the improvement to be sustained ; it\u2019s not just a one -month or two- month phenomenon.  We \u2019re not going to be looking for little wiggles in the numbers that are going to cause us to radically shift our policy .

Someone told me that less than 1 percent of all mortgages originated in the past 18 months went to borrowers with impaired credit history .  So when we talk about people and a  Main S treet policy, it seems like you \u2019re struggling , like many other central banks , and that \u2019s to get the low rate s down to\u2014the challenge is to get them to September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 13 of 25 people who really need them, people who are paying high rates or companies with somewhat fragile balance sheets .

It\u2019s up to them to make those decisions .  I think we \u2019re seeing modest improvement in mortgage markets .  One thing that \u2019s helping is a stronger housing market .  One reason that lenders have been very constrained is they are worried about further house price declines that will make the collateral worth less than the loan.  As house prices have begun to rise, as the economy has gotten a little stronger , lending standards have eased just a bit .  There\u2019 s also been other changes which are useful .  I note , for example, that the FHFA and the GSEs have recently changed their policy on putbacks  so that banks will have more certainty abo ut under what conditions  a mortgage will be put back to them if it defaults .  So I think there \u2019s number of things in train that will make the mortgage markets a little bit more open, and that is one factor , actually , that could make our policy more effecti ve rather than less effective over time\u2014if more people have access to mortgage credit, more people can take advantage of the low rates that we \u2019re providing.

As house prices have begun to rise, as the economy has gotten a little stronger , lending standards have eased just a bit .  There\u2019 s also been other changes which are useful .  I note , for example, that the FHFA and the GSEs have recently changed their policy on putbacks  so that banks will have more certainty abo ut under what conditions  a mortgage will be put back to them if it defaults .  So I think there \u2019s number of things in train that will make the mortgage markets a little bit more open, and that is one factor , actually , that could make our policy more effecti ve rather than less effective over time\u2014if more people have access to mortgage credit, more people can take advantage of the low rates that we \u2019re providing.  GREG IP .  Greg Ip of the Economist .  Mr. Chairman, one of the innovations of your statement today is that you have for the first time explicitly predicated your monetary policy action on the achievement of explicit economic goals , in this case a substantial improvement in the labor market .  Could you give us some explanation of how that conditioning wil l make your policy more effective than if you had simply done as you previously have :  announced the policy September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 14 of 25 and then conducted it?  And a technical question:   When \u201c Operation T wist\u201d ends , do you anticipate adjusting the size of your asset purchases in orde r to maintain the $85 billion monthly flow of long- term asset purchases?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  On the latter , when Operation T wist ends, we will be looking at the whole set of asset pur chases in order to make decisions .  We \u2019ll be looking at the state of the economy , as we described in the statement .  In particular , what \u2019s the state of the labor market, what \u2019s the state of the outlook for economic growth?   On conditioning , our policies have always been conditional in that we \u2019ve always been clear that our asset  purchase s, for example, were reviewed periodically to see if they were still necessary, if they needed to be expanded .  We did extend the maturity extension program , for example, when we thought that more support was needed for the economy , so our policie s have always had a significant element of conditionality .  But the idea here is to make that more explicit, more transparent to the public, make it more obvious that the Fed will do what \u2019s needed to provide the support for the economy .  And we hope that w hat that will do is provide a bit more assurance, maybe a bit more confidence , that the Fed will be there to do what it can .  Again, we \u2019re not promising, you know, a cure to all these ills.  But what we can do is provide some support , and by assuring the public that we will be prepared to take action if the economy falters, we \u2019re hopeful that that will increase confidence and make people more willing to invest, hire , and spend\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Sir , just to follow  up on\u2014Peter Barnes with Fox Business \u2014to follow up on Darren\u2019 s questions, a question about getting back to full employment .

Governor Romney \u2019s comm ents notwithstanding , what are your plans?  Do you plan to leave at that time ?  W ould you consider an appointment to a third September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 15 of 25 term at the Fed at all?

Thank you\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well , on the former , I\u2019m\u2014I have a lot to do.  I am very focused on my work, and I don \u2019t have any decision or any information to give you on my personal plans .  On the politics, we have tried very, v ery hard \u2014and I think we \u2019ve been successful \u2014at the Federal Reserve to be nonpartisan and apolitical .  We make our decisions based entirely on the state of the economy and the needs of the economy for policy accommodation .  So we just don\u2019 t take those factors into account , and we think that \u2019s the best way to maintain our independence and maintain the trust of the public.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chairman , Donna Borak with American Banker .  My question pertains to Basel  III.  Community bankers , as you know , have been very worried about the impact that t hese rules will have on their banks , especially given the fact that there\u2019 s been some industry consolidation, and some have  even questioned  whether or not the Fed has actually looked at  the impact that the rules would have on smaller -sized institutions .  So my question for you is , will there be relief for the smaller institutions , and can you provide any assurance that this will not be a one -size-fits-all regulation \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Certainly .  We are very interested in and very focused on community banks  at the Fed .  We believe they play a very important role in our economy  and in our communities .  We have a number of ways of communicating with community banks .  It includes our advisory council made up of comm unity bankers .  It includes a special set  of September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 16 of 25 programs we have to reach out and talk to community bankers .  So we are very interested in their views .  I speak regularly to conventions and the like and talk to various groups .  In terms of Basel  III, of course , it\u2019s not one -size-fits-all.  Many \u2014and, indeed , many of the most difficult, complex regulations apply only to the largest and most complex institutions \u2014for example, the capital surcharge that the largest  banks have to hold, t he complex rule s applying to trading books  and derivatives, the extra supervision under section 165, the orderly  liquidation authority, the liquidity rules \u2014the whole range of things that apply only to the largest , most complex , and internationally active banks .  For the smaller banks , what our propose d rule does is try to  strength en their capital, and many small banks will already meet those capital requirements .  Smalls banks tend to be very well capitalized .  But , of course , it\u2019s important for small banks to be well capitalized as well as large banks .  And there\u2019 s a leve rage requirement .  But , again , most of the rules, most of the \u2014particularly the most complex rules in Basel  III will not apply to the smaller banks .  Indeed, banks under $500 million have special exemptions from these rules .  Having said all of that , I remind you that what we have now is a proposed rule , and we \u2019re receiving comment on that .  We have a subcommittee of our supervision committee with two  experienced \u2014one community banker, one community bank supervisor  on it from our B oard who are particularly i nterested in making sure that the rules are not excessively onerous , and we will be looking at the comments and trying to make sure that we take into account the needs of community banks when we put out the final rule.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman .  Yest erday former Fed Governor Larry Meyer at a conference in Washington said he \u2019d never seen such a divided Fed.

Could you comment on former Governor Meyer \u2019s September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 17 of 25 suggestions , and then \u2014and sometimes don \u2019t you think, don\u2019 t you wish that some of the Fed officials who don\u2019 t support QE would keep their \u2014keep their fears to themselves ?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNA NKE:  Well , as you know , we are living in a very complex time and dealing with a complex economic situation and a variety of novel and different issues , including new policies that haven\u2019 t been used in the same way in the  past, and so naturally we have a r ange  of views, a range of opinions .  I think on the whole that \u2019s probably a good thing .  It\u2019s good to hear different points of view , and it \u2019s good to make sure that the points of view that are outside the Fed are reflected in the discussion around the tabl e inside the Fed .  So we have a very collaborative and collegial discussion process , that , again \u2014that spans a range of views .  We were, however , able to come to a pretty good consensus \u2014as you know , the vote on this was 11 to 1\u2014and that \u2019s a sign that the broad center of the Committee does support these actions and will continue to support them going forward.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Does the negative commentary hurt QE ?  Could it , if people in the market don\u2019 t think it will work?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  There \u2019s going to be negative commentary whether it comes from Fed officials or not .  Again, because there\u2019 s a range of views \u2014some people think it \u2019s more effective than others .  I discussed some of the evidence in my speech in Jackson Hole , and I talked abo ut the fact that, you know, different researchers have gotten different estimates of the impact .  Virtually all of them find that there is some beneficial impact, but they disagree on how much .  So, there \u2019s going to be disagreement .  And again, I personall y don \u2019t think that it\u2019 s a panacea, I personally don \u2019t think it\u2019 s going to solve the problem .  But I do think it has enough force to help nudge the economy in the right direction.

I was curious to know what policy actions you \u2019d like to see outside the Fed to try and address this .  And, secondly, also on the \u201cfiscal cliff, \u201d the expected spending cuts and tax increases, how concerned are you about that?  And what ammunition do you have to deal with that, if that becomes a problem?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well there \u2019s, again, a range of areas where actions could be taken, and I can \u2019t really prescribe all those possible responses .  I would focus, I think, on the fiscal side .  We cur rently have the so -called fiscal cliff .  If no action is taken, there \u2019s going to be a very substantial increase in taxes and cut in spending on January 1 of the coming year .  The CBO has suggeste d that  if that\u2019s allowed to take place, that it would cause unemployment to begin to rise , and it might throw the economy back into recession.  So I think one very basic thing that could be done to help address the recovery \u2014the weakness of the recovery and the need  for more employment \u2014would be to address the fiscal clif f while simultaneously addressing longer -term fiscal sustainability issues which remain, of course, very serious .  So that \u2019s one area where there is a lot of potential benefit .  If the fiscal cliff is n\u2019t addressed, as I \u2019ve said, I don \u2019t think our tools are strong enough to offset the effects of a major fiscal shock, so we \u2019d have to think about what to do in that contingency .  So I think it \u2019s really important for the fiscal policymakers to, you know, work together and try to find a solution for that\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr . Chairman, my name is Patrick Welter  with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.  I have two questions , if I may.  One is in the projections .  In the economic and inflation projections , you foresee a low inflation r ate below 2 percent to 2015\u2014not  you personally , but the FOMC .  I am wondering , if you look at the growth rate s, you have growth rates of about 3.4 perc entage points in 2014 and 2015.  How long September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 19 of 25 do you think that it might work that you have such strong growth and no inflation pressur e?  And the second question, if I may , is, a lot of economist s don\u2019 t see too much effect out of the further round of QE3.  Aren \u2019t you worried that , in promising that you will do whatever you can, even if it is tiny,  small, that you give some kind of carte blanche to the fiscal policy and to the C ongress not to do enough on their side of the policy action?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, the\u2014on inflation, we do anticipate at some point what \u2019s normal in a recovery, which is , given that the economy fell very quickly and there \u2019s a lo t of unused capacity, there \u2019s a lot of slack in the economy, it would be normal that there would be a peri od where the economy would grow faster than trend in order to make up some of the slack that was created .  So we don\u2019 t anticipate the economy is going to be overheating anytime soon .  And as long as we pay close attention to inflation expectations as well as the trajectory of the economy, we think inflation will remain close to our 2 percent target .  On your second question, certainly , there is a range of views  on how effective these tools are .  I\u2019ve spent  a lot of time , as all of my colleagues have , looking at the evidence,  and, of course , the staff here have done a great deal of work on the question.  And the bottom line for most of it, most of the research, is that while these  tools are not so powerful that they can solve the problem, they are at least able to provide meaningful support to the economy .  Our job is to use the tools we have to meet our mandate, which is maximum employment and price stability .  So if we have tools  that we think can provide some assistance and we\u2019 re not meeting our mandate , then I think that our obligation is to do what we can .  Of course , we would like to see policies across the board to help address these issues .  But, you know, that \u2019s not our province;  we are the monetary policy authorit ies, and our job is to use monetary policy as effectively  as we can.  September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 20 of 2\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Steve Beckner of MNI, Mr. Chairman.  There have been concerns raised , questions raised by people like Columbia Professor Michael Woodford and others about the credibility of your forward guidance on the path, the future path of the federal funds rate \u2014the idea being that , to the extent it\u2019 s conditional, it \u2019s not really convincing and doesn\u2019 t provide the kind of confidence that you re ferred to .  Now, on this latest statement, you\u2019ve removed some of that conditionality .  I am particularly struck by the statement that \u201c the C ommittee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens .\u201d  I assume that was done to make your forward guidance more credible, and yet the question remains whether, you know, as the economy picks up steam, whether the FOMC will really follow through and keep rates lo w or whether you will do as the Fed has always done and begin to raise the funds rate.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, that\u2019 s an important question.  Michael Woodford\u2014 who, by the way, is my former colleague and coauthor and friend, so I know him quite well , and  I know his works quite well \u2014I think, actually, the thrust of his research is that forward guidance\u2014communication about future policy \u2014is, in fact , the most powerful tool that central banks have when the interest rate is close to zero .  And he advocates pol icies like nominal GDP targeting , for example, that would essentially require credibility lasting many years , the implication being that the Fed would target the nominal level of GDP  and promise to do that for many years in the future even if inflation, you know, rose as part of that policy .  So his own perspective is that credibility is the key tool that central banks have in order to get traction at the zero lower bound.  Whether we have the credibility to persuade markets that we\u2019 ll follow through is an empirical question .  And the evidence , which I also , again , discussed in my remarks recently , is that when we \u2019ve announced extended guidance , that financial markets have September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 21 of 25 responded to that, that private -sector forecasters have changed their estimates of what unemployment and inflation will be when the Fed begins to remove accommodation.  So the empirical evidence is that our announcements do have considerable credibility .  And I think there\u2019 s a good reason for that, which is that we have talked a lot both publicly and privately about the rationale for maintaining rates low even as the economy strengthens, and I think the basic ideas are broadly espoused within the Committee .  And so there is a consensus that even as the personnel change and so  on going forw ard, that this is the appropriate approach, and that by following through, we will have created a reserve of credibility that we can use in any subsequent episodes that occur.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Don  Lee with the L.A. Times .  With mortgage rates already at historica l lows, how much further do you think the actions, your actions , will drive down the rates , and related to that, I \u2019m assuming that you expect the purchase s of mortgage -back ed securities to have a meaningful effect on refinancings and housing activity .  Wha t would that look like?  What would that meaningful effect mean?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, again , as I mentioned before , it\u2019s true that our mortgage -back ed securities purchases ought to drive down mortgage rates, and put downward pressure on mortgage rates , and create more demand for homes and more refinancing .  But it will depend, again , ultimately on several things .  One will be on the amount that we do, the amount of purchases  that we do, and that in turn is going to be a function of how the economy evol ves.  If the economy is weaker, we\u2019 ll do more, and in those case s, probably rates would be pretty low at any case because the economy is looking weak .  If the economy is stronger, strong enough to create improving labor market conditions , we won\u2019t have to do as much .  And so, the amount that we do depends on how the economy evolves .  So, since I don \u2019t know exactly how much September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 22 of 25 we\u2019ll end up doing , it\u2019s a little bit hard to give you an exact estimate .  So I think that\u2019s , you know, in terms of how many homes and t hose kinds of questions , again , I think that the markets are looking \u2014are l ooking a little better .  I think that house prices are beginning to rise in some markets, which will encourag e people to look at homes , will encourage lenders to make more mortgage l oans.  So I \u2019m hopeful that we \u2019ll see continued progress in the housing market ; that\u2014that has been one of the missing pistons in the engine here .  Housing is usually a big part of the  recovery process .  We haven \u2019t had that nearly to the usual extent, and to the extent that we can support housing, I think that would be a very useful outcome\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  There doesn\u2019t  seem  to be  that many people who could qualify for refinancings.

And sales of homes are down still, but they have been rising steadily, and we \u2019re trying to provide more support for people who want to go out and buy homes , construct  homes, and also those who want to refinance .

It\u2019s been a few months since you made that statement , and I\u2019m sure your staff are working hard on it , but how much of a headwind to the economy is the fear of the federal government just s ort of cutting way back , falling  across  the fiscal cliff or even \u2014even if they take a few steps back from the cliff , it\u2019s still September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 23 of 25 there.  How much is that fear contributing t o lack  of\u2014lack of growth or adequate GDP growth in the economy?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well  I\u2014you know, it\u2019s pretty hard to give you a number, but I can certainly confirm that as the R eserve Bank presidents and G overnors made their reports today and yesterday  around the table, there was considerable discussion of uncertainty , including policy uncertainty, fiscal policy uncertainty, and the implications of that for hiring and investment decisions .  A lot of \u2014a lot of firms are waiting to see whether that problem will be resolved .  And if so, how?  And I think it is a concern .  It is something that is affecting behavior now.  But again, I don\u2019 t know \u2014I don\u2019 t have a number , I don\u2019 t know how big that effect is , but, certainly , the sooner that can be resolved, the sooner it can be clarified , it will be beneficial not just because we avoid the cliff itself , but because we clarify for firms, for employers and investors , how that \u2019s going to be resolved.  So, I think it \u2019s an issue that is of some consequence, yes\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Mr. Chairman.   Catherine Hollander , National Journal .  How much was the fiscal cliff a decision , or a factor in your decision, to do an open-ended  QE instead of a fixed sum ?  Or fiscal uncertainty more generally?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  We ll, we take the economy as we find it .  There are a lot of headwinds right now that are affecting the economy .  There \u2019s fiscal headwinds .  There\u2019 s international factors , including the situation in Europe .  There\u2019 s factors arising from still-impaired credit  markets , and so on.  So we looked at that \u2014looked at the economy from the perspective of, you know, how quickly it \u2019s been growing over the last six months to a year .  And, as I talked about in a speech in March , in order for employment gains to be sustaine d, for unemployment to fall, the economy needs to grow at or above trend levels.  And lately it\u2019 s not September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 24 of 25 really been at trend .  So we \u2019ve been responding to that problem and trying to take steps that will assure somewhat stronger growth and, we hope , will help  bring unemployment down over time .  Now, again, the fiscal cliff, the uncertainty about  the fiscal cliff , is one of the factors , one of the headwinds , but I \u2019m sure there are many others , and we don\u2019 t try to differentiate among them in any sense.  If the f iscal cliff does occur, I suspect it won\u2019 t, and I hope it won\u2019 t, but if it does, and we get the kind of impact the Congressional B udget O ffice is talking about, as I \u2019ve said, I don\u2019 t think the Federal R eserve has the tools to offset that , and we would have  to rethink at that point .  But we \u2019ve taken the steps we\u2019 ve taken now because we\u2019 d like to see the economy gather more momentum , and the more momentum it has, the better placed we are to deal with any shocks that might come down the road\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Marcy Gordon with the Associated Press .  One of the aspects we\u2019ve seen in recent reports on unemployment is the shrinking labor force .  Is that something that\u2019s of specific concern to you, and what does it tell us about the labor market and the economy?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  .  Well , you are absolutely  right .  And as I mentioned earlier, the unempl oyment decline last month was more than 100 percent accounted for by declines in participation .  Some decline in participation is anticipated , is as expected .  We\u2019re an aging society.  We have more people retiring .  Female participation has flattened out ; it hasn \u2019t continued to climb as it did for several decades .  We\u2019re seeing less participation among younger people, fewer college students taking part -time jobs and the  like.  So part of this decline in participation was something that we anticipated quite a long time ago, but part of it is cyclical.  Part of it reflects the fact that some people \u2014because they have essentially given up or at least are very discouraged \u2014hav e decided to leave the labor force.  And the anticipation is that if the September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 25 of 25 economy really were to strengthen, and labor markets were to strengthen , at least some of those people would come back into  the labor force .  They might even temporarily raise the unemployment rate because they \u2019re now looking again.  So the participation rate over and above \u2014the decline in participation rate over and above the downward trend is just one of the other indicators of a general ly weak labor market .  And it\u2019s why I said ea rlier that we do want to look at a range of indicators, not just the unemployment rate , although that \u2019s a very important indicator , not just payrolls , although that also is a leading indicator , but participation, hours, part -time work , and a variety of other measures which suggest that our labor market is still in quite weak condition.

The weak job market should be a concern for every American.The FOMC acknowledges the negative impact of high unemployment on individuals and the economy, as well as the long-term consequences for those who have been out of work for an extended period. To support the recovery and maintain price stability, the FOMC has implemented unprecedented levels of policy accommodation, carefully considering the potential benefits and costs of each action. However, despite these efforts, the current pace of economic growth remains insufficient to make significant progress in reducing unemployment.The FOMC has decided to implement further policy accommodation by expanding its purchases of securities and extending its forward guidance on the federal funds rate. This includes purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month, which should increase downward pressure on long-term interest rates and provide support for the housing sector.The FOMC has decided to keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels until at least mid-2015, providing assurance to households and businesses. However, the economic outlook remains uncertain due to various factors such as the situation in Europe and tight credit for some borrowers.The Federal Reserve acknowledges concerns about low interest rates hurting savers and risking inflation, but emphasizes that their purchases of securities are not comparable to government spending. They plan to normalize their balance sheet by selling financial assets back into the market or allowing them to mature, and believe their asset purchase programs will help reduce the federal deficit and debt. Additionally, while low interest rates may negatively impact holders of interest-bearing assets, they also support the value of other assets and are necessary for a healthy economy.Low interest rates may have some drawbacks, but they ultimately benefit Americans by promoting a healthy and growing economy.

They aim to bring inflation back to the target over time, considering the deviations of both objectives from their targets.", "'QUESTION': Why should people believe that the Fed's policy actions will make a difference in the labor market, and is there a limit to what Fed policies can do going forward?\n'ANSWER': The Fed believes that their policies have had real benefits for the economy, providing support, easing financial conditions, and reducing unemployment. However, monetary policy alone cannot solve these problems, and they are looking for policymakers in other areas to contribute as well.", "'QUESTION': Do you think that the 0.4 percent difference in the projections is realistic?\n'ANSWER': The 0.4 percent difference in projections is based on assumptions about appropriate policies. Some projections may not have considered these policies, so it may underestimate what we can achieve. However, it is important to note that while we can make a significant contribution to reducing unemployment, we do not have the tools to solve the problem entirely.", "'QUESTION': Can you give us an idea of how much you think lowering interest rates might push rates down and how it could change demand in the economy?\n'ANSWER': The ultimate effect of lowering interest rates depends on the actions of the economy. The amount of support provided will depend on how the economy evolves. These policies can bring down a range of interest rates, including mortgage rates and corporate bond rates, and also impact stock and home prices. While it will have a significant effect on the economy and the labor market, it is not a complete solution but a step towards improving unemployment levels.", "'QUESTION': Is this the limit of what the Fed could do? If the unemployment situation doesn't improve, what other measures do you have available?\n'ANSWER': There are a variety of possibilities and the two primary types of tools are balance sheet actions and communication tools. The Fed can restructure balance sheet actions and work on improving communication with the public to ensure accommodation for recovery.", "'QUESTION': How does the Fed's policy differ from trickle-down economics?\n'ANSWER': The Fed's policy aims to create more employment and stimulate the economy by affecting financial asset prices. Rising home and stock prices can make consumers feel wealthier and more willing to spend, which in turn increases demand and encourages firms to hire and invest.", "'QUESTION': Can you define and describe more specifically what \"improve substantially\" means in regards to the labor market? And what is the Committee referring to when it says \"additional asset purchases\" and \"other...tools\"?\n'ANSWER': We are looking for ongoing sustained improvement in the labor market, with unemployment coming down gradually over time. There is no specific number in mind. As for additional asset purchases, we can continue, expand, or change our mortgage-backed security purchases, and we also have the capacity to purchase Treasuries. Other policy tools include communication policies to better explain our rate policies and create more accommodative financial conditions.", "'QUESTION': Why did the Fed choose not to adopt a specific target for asset purchases?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is looking for a general improvement in labor market conditions, not just a decrease in the unemployment rate. They want to see more jobs, lower unemployment, and a stronger economy that can sustain the improvement. They have decided to define their criteria qualitatively and will do enough to ensure the economy gets on the right track.", "'QUESTION': What is the Chairman's appetite for doing more targeted credit programs if there is support from the Treasury Secretary and Congress?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman does not advocate specific programs and believes it is up to Congress to make those decisions. There has been modest improvement in mortgage markets, with a stronger housing market and easing lending standards. Changes in policy by FHFA and the GSEs have also made mortgage markets more open.", "'QUESTION': How will the conditioning of monetary policy on the achievement of explicit economic goals make it more effective than previous policies?\n'ANSWER': The conditioning of monetary policy on explicit economic goals makes it more transparent and provides assurance to the public that the Fed will provide support for the economy. This increased transparency and assurance may increase confidence and encourage investment, hiring, and spending.", "'QUESTION': What are Chairman Bernanke's plans for his term at the Fed and would he consider a third term?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke does not have any information to provide on his personal plans. The Federal Reserve remains nonpartisan and apolitical, making decisions based solely on the state and needs of the economy to maintain independence and public trust.", "'QUESTION': Will there be relief for smaller institutions under Basel III and can you assure that it will not be a one-size-fits-all regulation?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is focused on community banks and believes they play an important role in the economy. Basel III rules do not apply to smaller banks, and the proposed rule aims to strengthen their capital. The Fed is considering comments and will take into account the needs of community banks when finalizing the rule.", "'QUESTION': Could you comment on former Governor Meyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggestions and whether some Fed officials should keep their fears to themselves?\n'ANSWER': We have a range of views within the Fed, which is a good thing as it reflects different perspectives. We have a collaborative and collegial discussion process that includes a variety of opinions. Despite this, we were able to reach a consensus on the recent decision, with the majority of the Committee supporting these actions.", "'QUESTION': Does negative commentary affect the effectiveness of QE?\n'ANSWER': Negative commentary is expected and there will always be a range of views on the effectiveness of QE. Different researchers have different estimates of its impact, but most agree that it has some beneficial impact. While it is not a solution to all problems, it can help move the economy in the right direction.", "'QUESTION': What policy actions would you like to see outside the Fed to address the unemployment problem? How concerned are you about the fiscal cliff and what ammunition do you have to deal with it?\n'ANSWER': Actions could be taken in various areas, but focusing on the fiscal side is important. If the fiscal cliff is not addressed, it could lead to a rise in unemployment and a potential recession. Addressing the fiscal cliff and longer-term fiscal sustainability issues would benefit the recovery and employment. If the fiscal shock is significant, the Fed's tools may not be enough to offset the effects, so fiscal policymakers need to find a solution.", "QUESTION: In the economic projections, how can there be strong growth rates without inflation pressure? Are you concerned that QE3 will not have much effect and give carte blanche to fiscal policy?\n\nANSWER: The FOMC expects a period of strong growth to make up for the unused capacity in the economy, so inflation is not a concern. While there are differing views on the effectiveness of QE3, it can provide meaningful support to the economy. The Fed's job is to use monetary policy effectively to meet its mandate, but it would also like to see other policies addressing the issues.", "'QUESTION': Are concerns about the credibility of the Fed's forward guidance justified?\n'ANSWER': The credibility of the Fed's forward guidance is an empirical question. The evidence shows that when the Fed announces extended guidance, financial markets and private-sector forecasters respond, indicating that it has considerable credibility. The Fed has talked extensively about the rationale for maintaining low rates, and there is a consensus within the Committee that this approach is appropriate.", "'QUESTION': How much further do you think the actions will drive down mortgage rates and what would the meaningful effect on refinancings and housing activity look like?\n'ANSWER': The impact of mortgage-backed securities purchases on mortgage rates and housing activity will depend on the amount of purchases and the strength of the economy. If the economy is weaker, more purchases will be made and rates will be low. If the economy is stronger, fewer purchases will be made. The hope is that supporting housing will contribute to the recovery process.", "'QUESTION': Can we expect a meaningful effect on an increase in refinancing activity?\n'ANSWER': Well, I think there'll be some, but the real benefit comes from people buying homes. Sales of homes have been rising steadily, and we're providing support for those who want to buy or refinance. Purchases of new homes generate construction activity and stimulate the economy.", "'QUESTION': How much is the fear of the federal government cutting back contributing to lack of growth in the economy?\n'ANSWER': The fear of the federal government cutting back is causing uncertainty and affecting hiring and investment decisions. Many firms are waiting to see if the problem will be resolved and this uncertainty is impacting behavior. While the exact effect is unknown, resolving the issue would be beneficial for firms, employers, and investors.", "'QUESTION': How much was the fiscal cliff a decision or a factor in the decision to do an open-ended QE instead of a fixed sum? Or fiscal uncertainty more generally?\n'ANSWER': The fiscal cliff and other factors such as international situations and impaired credit markets are all headwinds affecting the economy. The Federal Reserve has taken steps to promote stronger growth and hopes to bring down unemployment over time. If the fiscal cliff does occur, the Federal Reserve may need to reassess its tools to offset the impact.", "'QUESTION': Is the shrinking labor force a concern and what does it indicate about the labor market and economy?\n'ANSWER': The decline in participation is partly expected due to an aging society, fewer college students working, and less female participation. However, some people have given up and left the labor force. If the economy strengthens, some of these individuals may return, temporarily raising the unemployment rate. The decline in participation, along with other indicators, suggests a weak labor market."]}
