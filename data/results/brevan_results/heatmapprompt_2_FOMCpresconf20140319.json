Associated Press.  Could you give us a little insight in how the decision was made on dropping the 6\u00bd percent numerical  target in the forward guidance?   Was there any concern expres sed that there \u2019s been criticism on forward guidance, that it\u2019 s confusing markets , not helping t hem in some ways?  W as there concern expressed that perhaps it would have been better to go to jus t a lower target , say, 6 percent?   And could you also address the concerns raised in the dissent that by dropping this , it lowers the commitment on fighting low inflation?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Thanks.  Well, as I mentioned in my statement, the reason the Committee  felt that the time ha d come to revise the forward guidance is not because we think it has not been effective.  I believe the Committee  does think it \u2019s been effective.  I think it \u2019s had a very useful impact in helping markets understand our expectations and  shaping their own.  But it is becoming \u2014as the unemployment rate gets closer and closer to 6\u00bd percent , to breaching that threshold tha t seems like the one that is likely to be breached .  The question is :  Markets want to know, the public wants to understand, beyond that threshold, how will we decide what to do?     So the purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the past, even though it is qualitative information , about what we will be looking at as the unemployment rate declines below 6\u00bd percent in deciding how long to hold the federal funds rate at this 0 to \u00bc percent range.  And , as I said, we\u2019 ve tried to give a general formulation of what we \u2019ll be looking at , which is :  How far are we?  How large are the shortfalls in achieving our goals ?  And how fast do we expect progress to be ?  Th at will be the main factors we\u2019 ll be looking at.  We initially started  with an unemployment rate as a threshold.  That was easy enough for the Committee  to say , \u201cWith an unemployment rate above 6\u00bd percent, we know we\u2019re not close to full employment, not close to an employment level consistent with our mandate, and unless inflation were a significant concern, we wo uldn\u2019 t dream of raising the federal funds rate target. \u201d  Now, the Committee  has never felt that the unemployment rate is a sufficient statistic for the labor market.  I think if I had to choose one indicator of the labor market, the unemployment rate is probably as good a  one as I could find.  But in assessing the real st ate of slack in the labor market  and ultimately of in flationary pressures that might\u2014or deflationary pressur es that could result from that\u2014it\u2019 s appropriate to look at many more things.  And that \u2019s why the Committee  now states we will look at a broad range of info rmation.  So the closer we get as we narrow in on coming closer to the target we want to achieve, w e will be carefully considering many indicators of how close are we to our tar gets.  S o those are the main reasons.  Now, you asked as well about the dissent.  President Kocherlakota felt \u2014I believe he noted in his dissent  that he endorses the new guidance about the likely path of the fed eral funds rate after we begin to finally raise it.  And that indicates that it\u2019 s unlikely to be back to normal levels for some  time , but he questions whether or not the  reformulated forward guidance shows    sufficient commitment of the Committee  to its 2 pe rcent inflation objective.  And I will simply say on my own behalf , and on behalf of the Committee , that we are fully committed to the 2 percent inflation objective , and we do not want to undershoot inflation for a prolonged period of time.  As I mentioned, monetary policy operates with lags , so, the policies we have in place, we think, will gradually \u2014only gradually \u2014move inflation back to 2 percent .  But if the Committee  had real concerns that inflation were going to remain persistently below 2 percent, I feel confident that the Committee  would act to prevent that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen , in the interest rate projections made by FOMC participants that supplement your statement, there seems to be a slight upward drift in the expectations for rates going out to 2016.  For instance, a majority of officials see rates at 1 percent or higher in this forecast round.  In the last forecast round, a  majority saw officials less than 1 percent.  I wonder if you could explain why there is this small upward drift in expected rates among Committee  members, whether these projections are a good guide for the public about where rates \u2014about the path of rates going forward, and also how you reconcile this upward drift with the assurances that the Committee  makes in its statem ent that rates will stay below normal levels well into the future.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, to my mind, there is  only very limited upward drift.  You know, the Committee \u2014I think the Committee , in assessing the economy \u2014if you compare today \u2019s assessment with December \u2019s, is virtually identical.  A lmost nothing has changed in the overall Committee  assessment of the outlook.  A s I mentioned, unemployment has come down.  The labor market more broadly , I think, has  improved a little more tha n we might have expected , and that  slightly more rapid improvement in the unem ployment picture might explain \u2014I can \u2019t speak for why  people write down what they do, but \u2014a little bit of the upward shift in those dots.     But, more generally, I think that one should not look to the dot plot , so to speak, as the primary way in which the Committee  wants to or is speaking about policy to the public at large.  The FOMC statement is  the device that the Committee  as a policy making group uses to express its opinions, a nd we have expressed a number of opinions about the likely path of rates .  In particular, the Committee  has endorse d the view that it anticipates it will be a considerable period after the asset purchase program ends before it will be appropriate to begin to raise rates.  And, of course , on our present path, well, that \u2019s not utterly  preset.  We would be looking at next fall.  So, I think that \u2019s importa nt guidance.  Looking further out, let \u2019s say if you look toward the end of 2016 when most participants are projecting that the employmen t situation \u2014that the unemployment rate will be close to their notions of mandate -consistent or  longer -run normal levels.  What you see, I think, if you look this time \u2014if you gaze at the picture from December or September , which is the first year that we showed those dot plots for the end of 2016, is the massiv e points that are notably below w hat the partici pants believe is the normal longer -run level for nominal short -term rates, and the Committee  today , for the first time , endorsed that as a Committee  view.  So I think that \u2019s significant.   I think that \u2019s what we should be paying attention to, and I would si mply warn you that these dots are going to move up and down over time a little bit this way or that.  The dots move d down a little bit in December relative  to September , and they moved up ever  so slightly.  I really don \u2019t think it\u2019 s appropriate to read very much into it.  More generally, you know, the end of 2016 is a long way out.  M onetary policy will be geared to evolving conditions in the economy , and the public does need to understand that as those views evolve, the Committee \u2019s views on policy will likely evolve with them.  A nd that \u2019s a kind of uncertainty that the Committee  wouldn\u2019 t want to eliminate completely from its guidance    because we want the policy we put in place to be appropriate to the economic conditions that will prevail years down the road\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  I wish to look not to the dots , but to the statement, as you suggest, Madam Chair , and that one particular paragraph, which says that the Committee  anticipates a lower -than-normal  rate even once you return to the long run.  So, just so I understand correctly, it mea ns that once you hit the longer -run unemployment rate of 5\u2014which is the central tendency  average of being 5.4 per cent\u2014once you get a 2 percent inflation rate, the market should not , then , anticipate the longer -run 4 percent fed funds rate, a nd that woul d be question one.  Question two is , doesn\u2019 t that implicitly suggest a shallower glide path once you take off , or once fed funds rate s would begin \u2014when you first hike them?   Wouldn\u2019 t that suggest a shallower glide path to the funds rate?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Yes, I think it does suggest a shallower glide path, and what the Committee  is expressing here, I would say , is its forecast of what will be appropriate some years from now ba sed on its \u2014the understanding that we \u2019ve developed about what are the economic forces that have been driving economic activity.   We\u2019ve had a series of years now in which growth has  proven disappointing.  N ow, members of the Committee  have different views about why this is likely to be true , that the funds rate\u2014when the labor market is normalized and inflation is back to our objective \u2014they maybe have slightly different views on exactly why it \u2019s likely to be the case that interest rates  will be a little lower than they would in the longer run.  But for many, it\u2019 s a matter of headwinds from the crisis that have taken a very long time to dissipate and are likely to continue being operative.  So, some examples I would say is, we have under \u2014many households are undergoing balance sheet repair.  There are many underwater mortgage holders , difficulties therefore in gaining access to    credit \u2014for example, through home equity lines of credit .  For some , that makes it difficult to finance small busin esses.  Mortgage credit is very difficult for those still to get without pristine credit scores .  That\u2019s improve d somewhat over time , but it \u2019s not back to normal .  For some , fiscal policy is somewhat tighter than would be expected over the  next several years.  For some , it\u2019s headwinds from the global economy play a role as well.   But the general assessment is that even after we\u2019ve had an accommodative monetary policy for long enough to get the economy back on track in the sense of meeting our objectives, the stance of policy that will be appropriate to accomplish that will be easier or involve somewhat lower than would be normal short -term interest rates.  Now, eventually , years later, most people think they will go back up.  But, as you sa id, that suggests the path will be gradual.  But I do want to emphasize , this is a forecast , and this is the Committee \u2019s forecast based on its understanding of the economy at this time .  And as we watch the economy over the next several years , that could e volve.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Ylan from the Washington Post .  You mentioned in your testimony on Capitol Hill recently that the Fed was trying to assess the balance of weather effects versus more fundamental  weakness in the economy as the reason for the slowdown in growth in the first quarter , and you guys mentioned in the statement weather specifically.  Does that mean that the Fed\u2019s analysis has come down on the side  of weather, or are you still concerned t hat there could be something else going  on that could be contributing  to slower growth ?  And you guys also lowered your forecast for GDP growth this year \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So , I\u2019d say , certainly  the analysis that we\u2019 ve done \u2014and we did spend a lot of time discussing weather  and how it \u2019s affected businesses and households in various parts of the country \u2014certainly weather has played an important role in weakening economic activity    in Q1.  It\u2019s not the only factor that is at work, and most proje ctions for growth in the first quarter are reasonably weak .  It\u2019s an important factor.  It\u2019s not the only factor.  But I would say it \u2019s likely in the view of most of the Committee  to begin to wash out in the second quarter , and we can even see some rebound .  Now, I would say , I know what we \u2019ve said about weather is a little bit complicated and confusing.  So, you know, let me just say between December and January , the Committee  saw data that le d it to be quite a bit more optimistic  about the economic outlook.  So  I would say incoming data since January , when our statement sounded quite an optimistic tone , partly down due to weather and partly down because we probably over did the optimism in January.  So , in some sense , our views have moved around here a little bit, but if we take December to March , the Committee \u2019s views are largely unchanged.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Madam Chairwoman.   I\u2019m Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A. Times.  You \u2019ve been  on\u2014you\u2019ve served on the Fed previously.  I\u2019m wondering , now , in the past few weeks as C hairwoman, what \u2019s been different about being on the Fe d in your responsibilities as Chair, compared to being just a B oard of Governors member?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, thanks.  I feel I \u2019m very lucky that I \u2019ve had a lot  of Fed experience to draw on  as I approach this role because it \u2019s complicated , and  now in many ways I feel the buck stops with me in terms of management of the FOMC and responsibility to assure that the Federal Reserve makes progress on its goals of getting the economy back on track and  making progress on our financial stability and regulation objectives .  So I feel that weight of responsibility keenly in the new role I have, and I \u2019m very committed to making sure that I provide the leadership that \u2019s necess ary for the Federal Reserve S ystem  to move forward on these goals.  But, you know, in terms of the conduct of business, it \u2019s pretty much the same as usual.     I\u2019m not envisioning , nor have there been so far , any radical changes in how the Federal Reserve does its business, and that includes operating the FOMC\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Madam Chair, given  that the new qualitative guidance doesn\u2019 t give any information about how you will trade  off your unemployment and inflation objectives, does it a ctually give us any information?   How will you trade off the risk of higher inflation versus faster  progress on unemployment as you get closer to full employment?   Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, I\u2019d say so far we haven \u2019t had that tradeoff to make because inflation is r unning well below our objective, a nd by any measure there remains substantial slack in the labor market.  So  tradeoffs and worrying about doing more or less because we have conflicting objectives, this really has not been an element in our discussions about how to be conducting policy now.  As we get closer to meeting our goals , it could become an element, a nd I would say that we \u2019ve given guidance in the statement \u2014and we gave perhaps more guidance in our so- called consensus  statement or statement of longer -run goals and mon etary policy strategies that we \u2019ve now reaffirmed for three years in a row \u2014that the Committee  would take a balanced approach in situations where our objectives conflict and we \u2019re faced with tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment.   When we first put our thresholds into effect, we envisioned a possible situation where such a tradeoff could arise, where we might fa ce a situation where unemployment was quite high\u2014namely , over 6\u00bd percent \u2014and inflation might be drifting close to 2  or even a little bit above 2.  And our threshold- based guidance gave some more concrete indication that we would tolerate inflation running a little bit over 2 percent with unemployment sufficiently high before moving the federal funds rate off zero.  And to the extent that that concrete guidance is usef ul,    the\u2014I don \u2019t believe that \u2019s a situation that we \u2019re likely \u2014if I thought that that was a situation we were likely to encounter in the next several years, we probably would have revised our forward guidance in a different way.  We revised it as we did , eliminating that language , because it doesn\u2019 t seem like a situation that\u2019 s at all likely.  But I would point you to the statement \u2014the final statement in th is statement that says that the FOMC does not see this guidance as indicating any change in our policy i ntentions , and I would include how we would make tradeoffs between our inflation and employment objectives if we were to face that situation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Ann Saphir  with Reuters.  First, I just wanted a quick clarification.  You said that something would happen by next fall , and we\u2014on a clear  path \u2014on a path until next fall.  I was  unclear if you were speaking of rate hikes or if you were speaking \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: I simply meant to say that if we continued to reduce the pace  of our asset purchases in the manner that we have, in measured steps , that the program would be winding down next fall\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: In this coming fall, you mean , not the fall of next year, is that\u2014just \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Yes, this coming fall.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: To be clear \u2014I just wanted to be clear about that.  Then once you do wind down the bond buying program, could you tell us how long of a gap we might expect before the rate hikes do begin?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, the language that we use in the statement is \u201c considerable \u201d period.  So, I \u2014you know, this is the kind of term \u2014it\u2019 s hard to define.  But, you know, it probably means something on the order of  around six months or that type of thing.  But, you know, it depends .  What the statement is saying is , it depends what conditions are like.  We need to see where the labor market is, how close are we to our full employment goal \u2014that will be a    complicated assessment not just base d on a single statistic \u2014and how rapidly are we moving toward it ?  Are  we really close and moving fast?   Or are we gettin g closer but moving very slowly?   And then, what the statement emphasizes , and this is the same language we used in December and January,  we used the language especially if inflation is running below our 2 percent objective.  Inflation matters here , too, and our general principle tries to capture that notion.  If we have a substantial shortfall in inflation, if inflation is persistently running below our 2 percent objective , that is a very good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for longer.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: The Committee \u2019s Vice Chairman , Bill Dudley , said recently, \u201c If the economy decided it was going to grow at 5 percent or the economy decided it wasn \u2019t going to grow at all, those would be the kind of changes in  the outlook that I think would warrant changing the pace of taper [ing].\u201d  Is that an accurate description of what you mean when you say that you \u2019re not on a preset course, anything between zero to five?  And, secondly , if I may, there \u2019s a lot of research showing that short -term unemployment seems to be responsible for the level of inflation and that long -term unemployment seems relatively uncorrelated.  Is that the Fed\u2019s view at this point?  Is that one reason that you expect inflation to rebound in the next couple of years?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I think the numbers you cited would be extremes in terms of defining what we \u2019d need to see.  I wouldn\u2019 t go to such extremes.  I guess the way I would put it is this :  There are two conditions for the Committee  to decide to continue tapering the pace of purchases.  The first is that we need to assess that the labor market continues to be on the mend and that we feel reasonably satisfied that the outlook is for further improvement in  the labor market that will get us back to our maximum employment objective.  And , second of all, we    need to see\u2014 and now coming back to inflation again\u2014inflation is low , and it \u2019s been running well below our objective.  And we need to see evidence that leaves us feeling satisfied that inflation will move up over time, that we believe the evidence is consistent with its moving up over time .   If the Committee  no longer feels comfortable making such assessments \u2014so, if there is enough change in the data we \u2019re seeing about the economy that it no longer seems reasonable or convincing to make those  two separate assessments, then a case has been made to change the pace of asset purchases and to deviate from the current plan.  So 5 percent  and 1 percent, those are very extreme numbers.  But I would want to feel confident in making those two statements about the labor market and inflation.   With respect to the issue of short -term unemployment and its being more relevant for inflation and a  better measure of the labor market, I \u2019ve seen res earch along those lines.  I think it would be tremendously premature to adopt any notion that says that that is an accurate read on either how inflation is determined or what constitutes slack in the labor market.  So I think this is something our Committe e will be looking at, especially as unemployment goes down and other labor market indicators hopefully simultaneously improve.  We \u2019ll be looking at a broad range of indicators.  We \u2019re looking to see progress on many different dimensions where we see slack in the economy, but I wouldn\u2019 t endorse, and I certainly don\u2019 t think our Committee  would endorse, the judgment of the research that you cited.

Thank you.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: So I think the numbers you cited would be extremes in terms of defining what we \u2019d need to see.  I wouldn\u2019 t go to such extremes.  I guess the way I would put it is this :  There are two conditions for the Committee  to decide to continue tapering the pace of purchases.  The first is that we need to assess that the labor market continues to be on the mend and that we feel reasonably satisfied that the outlook is for further improvement in  the labor market that will get us back to our maximum employment objective.  And , second of all, we    need to see\u2014 and now coming back to inflation again\u2014inflation is low , and it \u2019s been running well below our objective.  And we need to see evidence that leaves us feeling satisfied that inflation will move up over time, that we believe the evidence is consistent with its moving up over time .   If the Committee  no longer feels comfortable making such assessments \u2014so, if there is enough change in the data we \u2019re seeing about the economy that it no longer seems reasonable or convincing to make those  two separate assessments, then a case has been made to change the pace of asset purchases and to deviate from the current plan.

How has  your dashboard evolved in the past few months in terms both of the \u2014which indicators    you like to watch most, and also in terms of the quality of data that you think\u2014whether it \u2019s positive, negative \u2014that you \u2019re getting from these indicators.  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I have talked in the past about indicators I like to watch or I think that are relevant in assessing the labor market.  In addition to the standard unemployment rate, I certainly look at broader  measures of unemployment.  I mentioned U -6 in my statement.  It\u20145 percent of the labor force working part time on an involuntary basis, that \u2019s an exceptionally high number relative to the measured unemployment rate, and it\u2014so, to my mind, is a form of slack that is \u2014adds to what we see in the normal unemployment rate and is unusually large.  However, it is coming down, as well as U -3.  It\u2019s movi ng in the right direction and has  moved even more recently than U -3.  Of course, I watch discouraged and marginally attached workers.  The share of long -term unemployment has been immensely high and can be very stubborn in bringing down, that\u2019s something t hat I watch closely .  Again, that remains exceptionally high, but it has come down from something like 45 percent  to high 30s, but that \u2019s certainly on my dashboard.  Labor force participation\u2014 I do think most research suggests that due to demographic factor s, labor force participation will be coming down, and there has been a downward trend now for a number of years.  But I think there is also a cyclical component in the fact that labor force participation is depressed.  And so, it may be that as the economy  begins to strengthen, we could see labor force participation flatten out for a time as discouraged workers start moving back into the labor market.  And so that \u2019s something I \u2019m watching closely.   In the Committee , we\u2019ll have to watch \u2014there are different views on this within the Committee , and it \u2019s hard to know definitively what part of labor force participation is structural versus cyclical , so it\u2019s something to watch closely.  I\u2019ve also mentioned, in the past , measures of labor market  turnover.  You mentioned quits.  A remarkably large share of workers quit their    jobs every month, usually going directly into another job.  And I take the quit rate in many ways as a sign of the health of the economy.  When workers are scared they won\u2019 t be able to get other jobs, they show a reduced willingness to quit their jobs.  Now, quit rates now are below normal pre-recession levels, but on the other hand, they have come up over time , and so we have seen improvement.  The job opening rate has also come up.  The hires rate, however, remains extremely depressed , and I take that as a sign of a weaker labor market.  But most of these measures, although they don\u2019 t paint the identical extent of improvement, if you ask about my dashboard, the dial on virtual ly all of those things is moving in a direction of improvement.   The final thing I \u2019d mention is wages , and wage growth has really been very low.  I know there is perhaps one isolated measure of wage growth that suggests some uptick, but most measures of w age increase are running at very low levels.  In fact, with the productivity growth we have and 2 percent inflation, one would probably expect to see , on an ongoing basis , something between\u2014perhaps 3 and 4 percent wage inflation would be normal.  Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent.  So not only is it depressed, signaling weakness in the labor market, but it is certainly not flashing .  An increase in  it might signal some tightening or meaningful pressures on inflation, at least over time.  And I would say we \u2019re not seeing that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Madam Chair, Wyatt Andrews from CBS.  For tens of millions of Americans, the recovery is an awful long time coming.  May we know your thoughts on why the recovery is so slow , and why the economy is not creating more jobs?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I think the short answer is that we have lived through a devastating financial crisis that has taken an exceptional toll on the economy in many different ways, from housing to leaving a huge number of homeowners  with mortgages living in homes with mortgages that are underwater , has had a highly negative effect on their credit ratings  and    their ability to access credit, has left businesses with very cautious attitudes that we see in busines s investment spending that is very restrained.  On top of that, we \u2019ve had weakness in the global economy , and we \u2019ve had a very tight fiscal policy at home .  After stimulus a t the onset of the recession, we \u2019ve had a good deal of fiscal consolidation in the United States and, at a time when fiscal policy normally in the past would have been serving to create jobs, fiscal policy from that standpoint has served as a headwind to the recovery.  And at the federal \u2014especially at the federal level , but also with sta te and local levels as well.  And so we have had a disappointing recovery.  And monetary policy has tried to do what we can to offset that.  But, you know, the linkages aren \u2019t as strong and aren \u2019t as quick as we might ideally like them to be.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  I\u2019d like to take you back to last summer when there were hints \u2014the Fed made hints that they were going to taper, and long -term interest rates spiked, mortgage rates rose.  What lessons \u2014looking back at that crisis, at that period, what lessons have you learned from it , and are you confident that you won\u2019 t repeat that \u2014those mistakes again?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I think there were quite a number of things happening at that time.  I think it \u2019s probably true that monetary policy may have played a role  in touching off that market reaction, but I think the market reaction was exacerbated by the fact that we had a very significant unwinding of carry trades  and other leveraged positions that investors had taken, perhaps thinking that the level of volatilit y was exceptionally low and perhaps lower than was safe for them to have assumed.  But we certainly saw \u2014now, in some ways, the fact that term premia in interest rates have come up somewhat, although it has had a negative effect on the recovery and that \u2019s evident in housing \u2014in the slowdown in housing \u2014perhaps it \u2019s diminished some financial instability risk that may have been associated with these carry trades and speculative activities that were unwinding during that time.  A lesson is that we will try, and w e    were trying then, but we will continue to try to communicate as clearly as we possibly can about how we will conduct monetary policy and to be as steady and determined and as transparent as we can to provide as much clarity as is reasonably certain \u2014given  that the economic developments in the economy are themselves uncertain \u2014but we will try as hard as we can not to be a source of instability here.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Madam Chair, Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News.  One of  the drivers last spring and summer of home prices and home sales  was that sense  that interest rates were going up, that they were spiking .  And now, a year later, we \u2019re looking essentially at a flat interest rate picture as far as homebuyers are concerned .  So, is there any sense on your Committee  that staying at this level loses its punch the longer we remain here?  And if I \u2019m a buyer, and I \u2019m thinking about going out and buying a home, why should I do that today as opposed to waiting a few more years or even months before interest rates then do go up?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I think the level of interest rates remains low by historic levels.  And the level of household formation is very depressed, has been very depressed for some time.  There are a lot of ki ds who were shacking up with their families and probably would like to be going out and acquiring places of their own, whether it \u2019s an apartment or a home.  There \u2019s a lot of demographic potential there for new household formation that would ultimately gene rate new construction, either sing le or multifamily, and the level of rates I think does matter.  And the fact that they \u2019re low now , I think, is something that should serve as a stimulus to people coming back into the housing market.  And what we \u2019ve not ye t seen\u2014the  pickup after the lull\u2014after interest rates went up last summer, I do expect housing activity to begin to expand more rapidly later on.  I don \u2019t think it\u2019 s only the expectation that \u201c I have to move now or things will be more expensive later\u201d that  spurs those decisions .

You shared a lot of the same policy views.  Can you tell us one way in which your chair manship will be different than Ben Bernanke\u2019 s\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I think we are committed to exactly the same set of goals.  And, you know, as I indicated,  I\u2014my goal, and I will, you know, throw myself into this as wholeheartedly as I can, is to make rapid progress, as rapid progress as we possibly can in getting this recovery back on track and putting Americans back to work and into jobs, and in moving inflation back up to levels at the Committee \u2019s target of 2 percent.  My predecessor was also devoted t o that.  Strengthening the financial system is a work in progress , and he made large inroads in strengthening the financial system.  I\u2019d just say , there is more work to be done, I have a long to- do list.  I would absolutely \u2014it\u2019 s high priority for me to see  further work done in addressing too- big-to-fail.  We have a to -do list of things we want to accomplish, and in  assessing threats to financial stability because neither one of us \u2014and no one wants to live through a financial crisis like the last one , and we  want to be extremely cognizant of emerging threats to the financial system.

We discussed in our meeting the direct -trade linkages or exposures of the U.S. banking system to the Ukraine and Russia are not large.  That\u2019s \u2014we \u2019re not seeing meaningful impacts now, but obviously there are geopolitical risks here that it \u2019s very important for us to be attentive to and to keep our eye on.

The Committee decided to reduce the pace of its purchases of longer-term securities and updated its guidance on short-term interest rates, clarifying that the change does not indicate a shift in policy intentions but rather anticipates policy evolving after the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. Despite recent softer data, the FOMC's outlook for progress towards maximum employment and inflation returning to 2 percent remains largely unchanged, although the unusually harsh weather in January and February has made assessing the underlying strength of the economy challenging.Despite weaker spending and production data than expected in January, the overall economic conditions are in line with expectations from December. The labor market, on the other hand, has continued to improve, with a lower unemployment rate and a decrease in broader measures of unemployment. The FOMC remains cautious about global financial markets but sees enough strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market. Inflation, however, remains below the Committee's objective, but they expect it to gradually move back towards the target. The Committee is aware that persistently low inflation could pose risks to the economy, but they also acknowledge that policy actions take time to impact inflation.The FOMC will continue to carefully assess incoming data to ensure that policy aligns with their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. The central tendency of unemployment rate projections has decreased, while projections for real GDP growth remain above estimates of longer-run normal growth. Additionally, inflation is expected to gradually move back towards 2 percent over time. As a result, the FOMC has decided to make another measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases, decreasing the monthly rate by $10 billion.The FOMC will continue to expand its holdings of longer-term securities and reinvest principal payments, which will put downward pressure on interest rates and support job creation. The Committee's decision to reduce the pace of asset purchases is consistent with its framework and will be contingent on the outlook for jobs and inflation.The FOMC has revised its forward guidance to better reflect current and future conditions, stating that the target federal funds rate is likely to remain in the present range if there is a shortfall in employment or inflation. The Committee will base its assessment on various factors, including labor market conditions, inflation pressures, and financial developments.Unemployment and underemployment are still high, inflation is low, and the FOMC believes that the current accommodative policy should continue to support maximum employment and price stability.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Could you give us insight into the decision to drop the 6.5% numerical target in forward guidance? Was there concern that forward guidance is confusing markets and lowering commitment to fighting low inflation?\n'ANSWER': The decision to revise forward guidance was not because it was ineffective, but because as the unemployment rate approaches 6.5%, markets want to know how decisions will be made beyond that threshold. The purpose of the change is to provide more information about what factors will be considered in deciding how long to hold the federal funds rate. The Committee is fully committed to the 2% inflation objective and would act to prevent persistent inflation below that level.", "'QUESTION': Why is there a slight upward drift in expected rates among Committee members and how does this reconcile with the assurances that rates will stay below normal levels?\n'ANSWER': The slight upward drift in expected rates is due to the slightly more rapid improvement in the unemployment picture. However, the dot plot is not the primary way the Committee communicates policy to the public. The Committee's views on policy will likely evolve with changing economic conditions.", "QUESTION: Does the statement suggest a shallower glide path for the funds rate?\nANSWER: Yes, Chair Yellen confirms that the statement suggests a shallower glide path for the funds rate. The Committee's forecast is based on the understanding that economic forces, such as the lingering effects of the crisis, will likely keep interest rates lower than normal even after the economy meets its objectives. However, this is a forecast that could change as the economy evolves.", "'QUESTION': Does the Fed's analysis lean towards weather being the main factor for the slowdown in growth, or is there concern about other factors contributing to slower growth?\n\n'ANSWER': Weather has played an important role in weakening economic activity in Q1, but it is not the only factor. The Committee expects weather effects to diminish in the second quarter and anticipates a rebound. The Fed's views have shifted due to data since January, but overall, the Committee's views have remained largely unchanged from December to March.", "'QUESTION': What has been different about being on the Fed as Chair compared to being just a Board of Governors member?\n'ANSWER': As Chair, I feel the weight of responsibility in managing the FOMC and ensuring progress on the goals of the Federal Reserve. However, in terms of conducting business, there haven't been any radical changes and it's pretty much the same as usual.", "'QUESTION': Does the new qualitative guidance provide any information on how the Federal Reserve will trade off unemployment and inflation objectives?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve has not had to make that tradeoff yet because inflation is below their objective and there is still significant slack in the labor market. However, as they get closer to meeting their goals, they may need to consider tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment. The Committee has provided guidance that they would take a balanced approach in such situations.", "'QUESTION': Were you referring to rate hikes or the winding down of the asset purchase program when you mentioned something happening by next fall?\n'ANSWER': I was referring to the winding down of the asset purchase program next fall if we continue to reduce the pace of our purchases in measured steps.", "'QUESTION': In this coming fall, you mean, not the fall of next year, is that?\n'ANSWER': Yes, this coming fall.", "'QUESTION': How long of a gap might we expect before rate hikes begin after winding down the bond buying program?\n'ANSWER': The term \"considerable period\" is used in the statement, which is hard to define but likely means around six months. However, the timing depends on various factors such as the labor market, progress towards full employment, and inflation. If there is a substantial shortfall in inflation, the funds rate may be held at its present range for longer.", "'QUESTION': Is it accurate to say that the Fed is not on a preset course and could change the pace of tapering based on extreme changes in the economy? Also, does the Fed believe that short-term unemployment is responsible for inflation and that long-term unemployment is not correlated?\n'ANSWER': The Fed does not believe extreme changes in the economy are necessary to change the pace of tapering. They assess the labor market and inflation to make decisions. Short-term unemployment is not seen as the sole determinant of inflation, and the Fed does not endorse the research suggesting this. They use a range of indicators to assess the labor market.", "'QUESTION': How has your dashboard of labor market indicators evolved in the past few months?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen mentioned that in addition to the standard unemployment rate, she looks at broader measures of unemployment such as U-6, which shows an exceptionally high number of part-time workers. She also watches discouraged and marginally attached workers, long-term unemployment, labor force participation, and measures of labor market turnover. Overall, most indicators on her dashboard are moving in the direction of improvement. Wage growth, however, remains low.", "'QUESTION': Why is the recovery so slow and why is the economy not creating more jobs?\n'ANSWER': The slow recovery and lack of job creation can be attributed to the devastating financial crisis, which has negatively affected the housing market, credit access, and business investment. Weakness in the global economy and tight fiscal policy have also hindered the recovery. Monetary policy has tried to offset these challenges, but the desired impact is not as strong or quick as desired.", "'QUESTION': What lessons have you learned from the market reaction to hints of tapering last summer and are you confident that those mistakes won't be repeated?\n'ANSWER': The market reaction was exacerbated by unwinding of carry trades and leveraged positions. The increase in term premia in interest rates may have diminished financial instability risk associated with these activities. The lesson is to communicate clearly and transparently about monetary policy to avoid being a source of instability.", "'QUESTION': Is there any sense on your Committee that staying at this level loses its punch the longer we remain here? And if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a buyer, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking about going out and buying a home, why should I do that today as opposed to waiting a few more years or even months before interest rates then do go up?\n'ANSWER': The level of interest rates remains low by historic levels, and the fact that they're low now should serve as a stimulus to people coming back into the housing market. The expectation of higher prices in the future is not the only factor that spurs housing decisions, and housing activity is expected to expand more rapidly later on.", "'QUESTION': Can you tell us one way in which your chairmanship will be different than Ben Bernanke's?\n'ANSWER': While we share the same goals, I believe there is still more work to be done in strengthening the financial system, particularly in addressing too-big-to-fail. We also need to be vigilant in assessing threats to financial stability. Overall, I will continue to pursue the agenda set by my predecessor.", "'QUESTION': Is the crisis in Ukraine a headwind for the U.S. economy? Are there risks to the U.S. economy and banking system? Did Russia move $100 billion in U.S. Treasury securities out of the United States to avoid sanctions?\n'ANSWER': The direct trade linkages and exposures of the U.S. banking system to Ukraine and Russia are not significant. Currently, there are no meaningful impacts or broader global financial repercussions. However, we are closely monitoring the situation and the geopolitical risks associated with it.", "'QUESTION': Who does Chair Yellen have in mind when she talks about the impact of the economic crisis and what does she do to stay in touch with the human side of it?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen acknowledges that many people, including herself, have been affected by the crisis. She stays in touch with the impact by talking to business contacts, listening to community groups, and studying effective programs to help those in low-income communities that have been most affected."]}
