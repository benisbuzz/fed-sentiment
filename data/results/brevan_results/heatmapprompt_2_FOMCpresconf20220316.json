Thank you so much for taking our questions .  I wonder if you could detail your thinking a little bit about how you\u2019 re considering the , you know, the risks of going too fast and potentially tipping the economy into recession and how you\u2019 re weighing those risks against the possibility of going too slowly, allowing inflation to become embedded, and kind of getting \u201c behind the curve.\u201d\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I guess I would start by saying that, in my view, the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated .  And why do I say that?  Aggregate demand is currently st rong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so .  If you look at the labor market, [you find that it is] also very strong.  Conditions are tight, and payroll job growth is    continuing at very high levels .  Household and business balance sheets are strong.  And so all signs are that  this is a strong economy and, indeed, one that will be able to flourish \u2014not to say withstand , but certainly  flourish \u2014as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy .  So I guess that \u2019s how I would say I \u2019m looking at th at.  Of course, the objective is to achieve price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market .  And that is our overall objective .  But we do feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  I was wondering, in the SEP s, you have quite a markdown to GDP from 4 to 2.8 percent .  I\u2019m wondering, how much of that do you feel is the result of the Fed\u2019s stiffer -than-expected action here?  You talk about monetary policy operating with a lag, but is this going to bite quicker than expected?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I don\u2019 t think that\u2019 s a big piece of it, actual ly.  I think some of that is just an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will hit our economy through a number of channels .  Highly uncertain, but, you know, you\u2019 re looking at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices .  It\u2019ll be\u2014we think that will weigh on GDP to some extent .  So that \u2019s part of what moved th ose assessments down .  I don\u2019 t think \u2014I mean, I think, generally, monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there . But remember, a s well, that 2.8 percent  is still very strong growth .  If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between , somewhere around 1.75 percent , 2.8 percent  is strong economic growth.  It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of the last expansion.  So , while it\u2019 s lower than last year \u2019s 5.8 percent , it\u2019s still quite strong growth .  So I would say it \u2019s quite a strong forecast .  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: So , in that context, what would trigger you to go faster or slower on the rate hikes?  \u201c Ongoing increases \u201d doesn \u2019t really tell us whether this is going to come in bigger chunks or evenly paced through the year \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, you know, the way we \u2019re think ing about this is that every meeting is a live meeting .  And we \u2019re going to be looking at evolving conditions .  And if we do conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then we\u2019ll do so.  I can \u2019t be perfectly specifi c about it, but that \u2019s certainly a possibility as we go through the year \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Michelle .  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions .  I\u2019m curious if you can be specific on when you expect to see inflation will start to come down, especially with the combination of rates going up, fiscal aid dissipating from the economy, and supply chains getting better?  And if you don\u2019 t start to see that, how will you signal it?   What will you be looking for?  And what will you be looking for over the course of the year?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I guess I would say that at the \u2014before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia\u2014so let \u2019s go back t o that .  I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year.  So now we \u2019re, you know, we \u2019re getting \u2014we \u2019re going\u2014we \u2019re already seeing a little bit of short -term upward pressure in inflation due to higher  oil prices, natural gas  [prices]  a little bit but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices .    The other thing is that you \u2019re seeing supply chain issues around shipping and around, you know, lots of countries and companies and people not wanting to touch Russian goods .  So that \u2019s going to mean more tangled supply chains .  So that could actually push out [in time] the relief we were expecting on supply chains generally.  So I guess I would say that the expectation i s still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year.  But if you look at where I read the SEP headline median , we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, and then we expect \u2014though, particularly with the effects of the war , but also the data we \u2019ve seen so far this year \u2014we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down, and then come down more sharply next year \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, over the last six months, the Fed  has shifted its policy stance quite a bit.  Six months ago, you were still buying assets .  Most officials weren \u2019t projecting any interest rate increases this year .  And yet, despite the shift over the last six months, real rates are as negative today as they were then .  So how concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy firming by leading real rates  to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the economy?   Thanks \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So that \u2019s one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that we\u2014the Committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the balance sheet has come.  And I would just say, I would go back to \u201c the economy is very strong,\u201d  as I mentioned .  Tremendous momentum in the labor market .  We expect growth to continue .  As I\u2014it\u2019s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin th e balance sheet shrinkage.    And I just wanted to say that as I looked around the table at today\u2019 s meeting, I saw a Committee that\u2019 s acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and [is] determined to use our tools to do exactly that .  You couched it in terms of real rates.  I would say, if you look at the SEP, you\u2019 ve got people getting close to or even above , in many cases, their estimate of the longer- run neutral rate .  So I understand that doesn\u2019 t do it for real rates .  But if you go out a year or two, many people are , in their forecasts , are having tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint.  So that \u2019s something that we \u2019re focused on.  Of course, it \u2019s a highly uncertain environment .  And, you know, we don\u2019 t know what \u2019s going to happen.  B ut we do know that we\u2019re going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals \u2014and that includes the price -stability goal.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  So , looking at the Summary of E conomic Projections, you all have inflation coming down over the course of the year to 4.3 percent .  And then you also have rates going up to what appears to still be below roughly what would be estimated to be the neutral rate, although I know that \u2019s a littl e bit uncertain .  So I was just wondering, how much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the Fed itself raising rates?  And then also, if I could just ask, given that Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrew her nomination, what do you e xpect to do with the regulatory portfolio?  Do you expect to assign a G overnor in charge of that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Okay , sorry.  Tell me again your first question \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: My first question is , how much do you expect inflation to come down as a dire ct result of the Fed \u2019s actions?  \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Okay .  So part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is clearly to do with factors other than our policy, and those would include , potentially , the supply chain is getting a little bit better, certain ly base effects.  You \u2019re lapping\u2014 as you know, when you look at a 12 -month trailing window, you\u2019 re lapping very high inflation in March, April, May, June of last year .  So there should be some effects from that in the  12-month picture .  Really what we \u2019re looking for, though, is month- by-month inflation coming down.  And so it \u2019s really , it\u2019s all the things we\u2019 ve been talking about, you know, that really haven\u2019 t helped much , including the shift away from goods and back to services , including supply chains getting better , including labor force participation \u2014all those things that have been sticky and not happening.  But a big part of it is, though, is the base effects I mentio ned as well . You know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation, and on growth, with a lag, of course .  And so you would see that more in \u201923 and \u2019 24.  But also , remember we started talking about rate increases last year.  For some months now , financial conditions have already incorporated a significant number of rate increases .  So it doesn\u2019 t start today .  The effect, the moves are already priced into the market for a few months now .  So the clock is running on that, and I think some of that will be seen in the second half of the year as well . So on the regulatory portfolio, I would just say this .  You know, we have an obligation to carry out under the law in supervision and regulation, and we \u2019re doing that .  That \u2019s what we \u2019re doing.  The committ ee is not active .  So what \u2019s happening is , things are coming to the full Board, and we \u2019re voting on them .  We\u2019 re getting our business done .  You know, we got the stress test s done .  We\u2019 ve looked at, you know, a number of proposals for mergers and things like that .  So we\u2019re working ahead.  Of course, we don\u2019 t have a Vice C hair for Supervision, as you mentioned.     But we \u2019re making do with the situation we have .  And a good number of things have come straight to the Board for approval \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  It \u2019s Neil Irwin at Axios .  Thanks for taking our questions .  In the s tatement of e conomic p rojections, we see a forecast of median 1.9  percent  fed funds  rate at the end of the year, 2.8 end of next year .  Wonder ed whether that aligns with your own expectations , in particular on that point of overshooting the long- term neutral rate .  And, also, if you can tell us anything about how that might be paced:  front -loaded, back- loaded.  H ow high is the bar for doing 50 at one meeting?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I don\u2019 t\u2014Neil, I \u2019ve never talked about my own SEP projection.  It\u2019s in there , but I , you know, I think Fed Chairs have generally not done that , because we just haven\u2019 t done it .  It\u2019s because we\u2019 re, you know, we have to put together the consensus on the Committee and present that consensus.  So I wouldn\u2019 t talk about my individual one . And in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is \u2014there \u2019s seven remaining meetings this year .  This isn \u2019t something we discuss or debate or agree on .  But there \u2019s seven remaining meetings, and there \u2019s seven rate hikes.  I would add there \u2019s also the shrinkage of the balance sheet , which , you people do the math different ways, but that might be the equivalent of another rate increase just from the runoff of the balance sheet .  So I don\u2019 t\u2014but I don\u2019t know .  We haven \u2019t made any decisions on front -end loading or going steadily through the year. And, as I mentioned, you know, if you look at the SEP, a good number of participants do see more than seven or eight increases this year .  And I can\u2019 t give you, I \u2019m not going to try to give you a really specific test for what it would take to do that .  But I  will say this, that we \u2019ll be    looking at the data as they come in.  We\u2019ll be looking to see whether the data show expected improvement on inflation .  We\u2019 ll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgement .  And we \u2019ll be going\u2014each meeting is a li ve meeting .  And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we\u2019 ll do so\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Ye s.  Thank you, Chair Powell .  Thank you, Michelle, for the question.  I have a more basic question .  The last time the CPI inflation \u2014I know you look at PCE, but CPI inflation\u2014 was as high as it is was July of 1981, when the effective federal funds rate was 19.2  percent .  But given the current data, how far behind the curve of inflation do you believe the Federal Reserve is, in your mind?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I just would say a couple things .  We have the tools that we need, and we \u2019re going to use them .  And , as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet .  We wi ll take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor market.  And, as I mentioned, if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, we\u2019ll do so.  I\u2019ll leave it to others to make the judgment you asked for \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  And then just as a follow on that, I wanted to get you on the record on this .  What impact has there been on your job, given the fact that  [indaudible] \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  We l ost you in the middle of the  question \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  \u2014t he impact that \u2014given you\u2019 re not actually confirmed and Governor Brainard is not actually confirmed, has there been any impact on your job or the Fed\u2019s ability to handle inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  None whatsoever . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle .  Chair Powell, how concerned is the Committee about the notable pickup in services inflation, which is perhaps less likely to self -correct?  And to what extent does it alter both the Committee \u2019s confidence that long- term inflation expectations will not de -anchor in the coming months as well as the balance of risks that the Fed  may need to raise interest rates further above neutral than indicated in the dot plot ?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Thank you.  So , of course , that\u2019s something we \u2019re watching report by report .  And we \u2019re certainly , we noticed it in the last meeting .  And it \u2019s part of the overall picture .  We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was, and that \u2019s part of what \u2019s happening is, in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they were before the crisis.  In other cases, it \u2019s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services.  And, yes, that is concerning .  In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the good side .  But, really , in this latest report, it was confined to vehicles, which is , admittedly , a large category .  So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligati on to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  Mr . Chairman , I wonder if you can help me understand the kind o f logic , if there is one , in the SEP here .  As I look at the median forecast, for example, for unemployment, it runs for the three -year window below the long- run rate .  I look at inflation    being above , over the three -year window , the long- run\u2014or call it th e neutral \u2014rate, so the economy still runs hot .  And that is all true in a regime when you run at least for two years the funds rate above the long- run rate . I guess my question is this:  Are you not create \u2014giving a forecast here that essentially suggests you will be continuing to run further \u201c behind the curve \u201d\u2014and never really get in front of inflation , because the economy will continue to run hot?  And, kind of on a related issue :  You said earlier  [that]  inflati on will take longer to return to price stability than we had originally expected .  Isn\u2019t that a choice you \u2019re making?  And, if so, why are you making that choice to let inflation run above price stability longer than you \u2019d like?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Right .  So o ur, if you look, our \u2014first of all, there is no \u2014you\u2019 re looking at medians .  But understand that there \u2019s no, it\u2019s not something we voted on.  It\u2019 s not a plan.  But if you look, people do have their in \u2014by  the end of this year, broadly, people are at or close to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer -run neutral interest rate .  Okay .  So that should stop pushing \u2014that should, in other words, that should be a removal of accommodation for monetary policy, basically .  At the same time, we will have done  significant balance sheet runoff .  And you can think of that as further . In the next year , and just looking at the median, you\u2019 re now above the , you know, above the, what people estimate to be the longer -run median.  A nd also, in many people \u2019s forecasts, that actually amounts to, you know, tight policy under , in real rates as well .  So why does unemployment remain at 3.5 percent ?  You know, it\u2014I  mean, a couple points .  One is the connection between\u2014in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight.     But this is \u2014clearly , what this is is an expectation that, really it amounts to that , the idea that wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the long run with 2 percent  inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive, full-economy kind of \u2014full -employment kind of wages , but not to a point where they \u2019re pushing up inflation anymore .  And , as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down.  And, you know, the reality is , there are many, many moving pieces , and we don\u2019 t know what will actually happen.  But no matter what happens, this is a C ommittee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched .  And so we are determined on that front, and we \u2019ll deal with what comes .  This is a modal , or most likely , expectation.  But we \u2019ll deal with what comes, whether it \u2019s better or worse \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi.  Thank you.  Well, let me follow up a bit on that.  I mean, there are a lot of economists skeptical that you can reduce inflation as much as you \u2019ve penciled in without raising the unemployment rate .  And I \u2019m wondering, just what are the mechanisms you see in reducing demand?   I mean, outside housing and autos, how do higher fed [funds] rates reduce consumer demand unless it \u2019s through higher unemploym ent?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, if you take a look at today\u2019 s labor market, what you have is 1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person.  So that \u2019s a very, very tight labor market \u2014tight to an unhealthy level, I would say.  So, in principle, if  you were \u2014let \u2019s say that our tools work about as you described, and the idea is, we \u2019re trying to better align demand and supply, let\u2019s just say in the labor market.  S o it would actually, if you were just moving down the number of job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on    wages.  You would have a lot less of a labor shortage, which is going on pretty much across the economy.  We\u2019re hearing from companies that they can \u2019t hire enough people .  They \u2019re having a hard time hiring .  So that \u2019s really the thinking there , is, you know, these are fairly well -understood channels, interest sensitive.  And , basically , across the economy, we\u2019 d like to slow demand so that it\u2019 s better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand.  And that , over time , should bring inflation down. And I \u2019ll say again, though, you know, we don\u2019 t have a perfect crystal ball about the future, a nd we \u2019re prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability .  You know, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there \u2014you really can \u2019t have a sustained period of maximum employment .  It\u2019s our\u2014one  of our most fundamental obligations is to maintain and restore, in this case, price stability .  So we \u2019re very committed to that .  Of course, the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market.  That is our intention , and we believe we can do that .  But we have to restore price stability \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks .  And I apologize if this covers some of the same ground you just talked about, Mr . Chair .  I think I missed some of your answer there .  But I have a follow -up question on the labor force .  We have seen some gains in the prime- age workforce in the last few months .  I wonder what you anticipate when it comes to some of the older workers as the health outlook has changed.  Are we goin g to see more recent retirees following Tom Brady back into  the workforce?  And what would that mean for wages and inflation?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  It\u2019s hard to say .  You know, what we saw in the last cycle was that, over the course of a long, steady expansion, l abor force participation outperformed expectations .  And that was just a , you know, it was a tight labor market, but it wasn\u2019 t\u2014it was nowhere near as tight as this labor market .  But it was a tight labor market, and so people stayed in the labor force longer .  It wasn \u2019t so much people coming back in the labor force after retirement.  That \u2019s not something that happens , in the aggregate , very much.  But , so that \u2019s what was happening. And, you know, more labor force participation is tremendously welcome .  And, of course, our policy does not in any way preclude that .  This is a situation where wages have moved up at the highest rate in a very long time .  And people are able to quit their jobs and move to better -paying jobs in the same industry or different indus tries.  So it \u2019s a really attractive labor market for people .  And once , you know, as we get past COVID well and truly, it becomes an even more attractive one .  So we hope that that will lead to more labor supply .  That \u2019s a good thing for the country.  It \u2019s a good thing for people . And it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation more at risk .  That last part is , we\u2019ll have to see whether , empirically , it winds up, works out that way.  But, in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well.  It\u2019s not the only thing we \u2019re looking for, though, from inflation.  We\u2019re looking for help from a number of different places and, most importantly, from our own policy.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle .  And thank you, Chair Powell .  I\u2019m sorry; I \u2019m having some communication problems .  So I missed some of the stuff you \u2019ve said , and m y apologies if this has been asked .  Since the FOMC met last January, financial condi tions have tightened markedly, equity price s down, T reasury yield \u2019s up, bond spread \u2019s risen, yield curve has     flattened a lot, and even further just today, dollar \u2019s up.  Is that welcome?  And would you like to see more in order to achieve your goals?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, as you know, policy works through financial conditions .  That \u2019s how it reaches the real economy \u2014by just the mechanisms you mentioned.  And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive , and appropriately so, fiscal policy , but also highly accommodative monetary policy\u2014 the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic .  So it is very appropriate to move away from thos e. And, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things \u2014we \u2019re not targeting any one or more of those things, but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal le vel so that \u2014because we know the economy no longer needs , or wants , these very highly accommodative, this  stance, which , you know, so it \u2019s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more  normal levels.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: When you say \u201c move to  a more  normal setting \u201d for financial conditions, that suggests to me that you want financial conditions to tighten further from where we are now .  Am I drawing the right inference from that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, yes.  So I would say, we look at a broad range of financial conditions .  And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy.  It\u2019 s not any particular financial condition, but a  broad range of financial conditions .  They will reflect to some extent \u2014they reflect any number of things .  But, yes , we need our policy to transmit to the real economy.  And it does so through financial conditions, which means that, as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that    it\u2019s at least less accommodative, that broader financial conditions will also be less accommodative \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask about the balance sheet discussion you had at this meeting .  Can you give us any more details?  Did you discuss whether to cap runoffs or whether to increase those caps over what period , if there were any details?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Yes .  Thank you for asking.  So, at our meeting today and yesterday, we made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance sheet .  And I \u2019d say we \u2019re now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we\u2019ll actually begin a  runoff at a coming meeting.  And that could come as soon as our next meeting in May.  That \u2019s not a decision that we \u2019ve made .  But I would say that that \u2019s how well our discussions went in the last two days . So a couple things just to add.  We\u2019 ll be mindful of the bro ader financial and economic context when we make the decision on timing, a nd we always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability .  We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what \u2019s a highly uncertain situation already.  So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this . In terms of the \u2014I would say this .  I don \u2019t want to get too much into the details , because we\u2019re literally just finalizing them.  But the framework is going to look very familiar to people who are familiar with the last time we did this .  But it \u2019ll be faster than the last time .  And, of course, it \u2019s much sooner in a cycle than last time .  But it will look familiar to you .  And I would also say that there \u2019ll be\u2014I\u2019m sure there\u2019 ll be a more detailed discussion of our \u2014in the minutes    to our meeting that come out in three weeks , where I expect that it will lay out, you know, pretty much the parameters of what we \u2019re looking at, which I think will look quite familiar.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, since September of 2020, you\u2019 ve been operating on a monetary policy framework that let the economy run hot to bring unemployment down.  That seems to be over .  But I \u2019m wondering how you would de scribe your reaction function now .  What is it that the F ed is trying to do other than bring inflation down?  In other words, is it , we\u2019re going to keep raising rates until it comes down to an acceptable level?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Ye s.  So I want to clear one t hing up again.  A nd that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates .  What we said in the framework changes was\u2014and this was really a reflection of what had happened for the prec eding couple of decades, actually .  What we said was, if we see, you know, low unemployment, high employment , but we don\u2019 t see inflation, then we \u2019re not going to raise rates \u2019 til we actually see inflation .  That\u2019s what we said, and that was the sense of it.  There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates.  That \u2019s simply not in the framework .  In fact, quite the contrary .  The framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2  percent . So I d o hear this, you know, that the framework \u2014really, we can \u2019t blame the framework .  It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation.  And then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was .  But it was not in any way caused by or related to the framework.  So , come to today.  You know, I think our vision on this on the Committee is very, very clear .  What we see is a strong labor market .  We see a  labor market with a lot of momentum, great job creation .  And we see the underlying economy\u2019s  strong.  Balance sheets are strong .  Yes, there are threats to growth    from, you know, from what \u2019s going on in Eastern Europe .  And, but, nonetheless, in the base case, there \u2019s a pretty broad expectation of strong growth. But inflation is far above our target.  And, you know, the help we \u2019ve been expecting and other forecasters have been expecting from supply -side improvement, labor force participation, bottlenecks, all those things getting better \u2014it hasn \u2019t come .  And so we \u2019re looking now to using our tools to restore price s tability, and we \u2019re committed to doing that .  And you see that, I think, in the S ummary of E conomic P rojections .  And you see that in the decision we make, and you\u2019 ll continue to see it in the decisions we make , going forward.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  If I could follow up by asking\u2014I guess what you\u2019 d call it i s the \u201cPaul Volcker \u201d question :  You don\u2019 t think unemployment is going to rise significantly , but, if it does, does that temper your desire to keep raising rates?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  The goal, of course, is t o restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market.  We have a dual mandate, and they \u2019re sort of equal .  But , as I said earlier, you know, price stability is an essential goal .  In fact, it \u2019s a precondition, really, for achieving the kind of labor market that we want, which is a strong and sustained labor market .  We saw the benefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market .  It pulled people back in, and there were really no imbalances in the economy that threatened the  long expansi on.  It, just , the pandemic arrived ; it was just a completely exogenous event .  So that \u2019s how we \u2019re thinking about it . We, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market .  But we do understand also that, really, you can\u2019 t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability .  So we need to focus on price stability particularly, because the labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong.  We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy .  \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell .  Hopefully no tech issues here on this front .  Wanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the F ed\u2019s doing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or understanding what the SEP is .  How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on future F ed policy going to address the inflation that they \u2019re feeling at the sto res on a daily basis?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Sure .  So I guess I \u2019d start by just assuring everyone that we \u2019re fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion.  We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the  source, have real effects on people \u2019s well -being.  And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone .  But it \u2019s really , especially , on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where \u2014I mean, we \u2019ve all  seen charts that show, if you\u2019 re a middle -income person, you\u2019 ve got room to absorb some inflation.  If you\u2019 re at the lower end of the income spectrum, it\u2019 s very hard because you\u2019re spending most of your money already on necessities , and the price is going up . But it\u2019 s punishing for everyone .  So it has been a difficult time for the economy .  But we do anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier .  It may take longer than we like, but I \u2019m confident that we \u2019ll use our tools to bring inflation down.  You asked about rates.  So the way that works , I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest -sensitive parts of the economy .  And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it \u2019s better match ed with supply.  And that brings \u2014that will bring inflation down over time .  That\u2019s our plan.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell .  Thank you so much fo r taking my question during this today .  My question is a follow -up to what Brian just asked .  What is your message to consumers out there who can no longer afford the basics due to this high inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, that is \u2014yes, indeed .  I mean, as I just said, you know, I think we do understand very much, and we very much take to heart , that it\u2019 s our obligation to restore price stability .  And, you know, we \u2019ve had price stability for a very long time and maybe come to take it for granted .  But now we see the pain .  I\u2019m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like .  And, you know, we \u2019re strongly committed as a C ommittee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more nor mal levels, which \u2014our target is 2 percent inflation .  So we will do that . And I just would want people to understand that, and that \u2019s\u2014but the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet .  And so financial conditions will become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity.  That will slow the economy, while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong .  And, you know, the good news is, the economy and the labor market are quite strong .  And that means the economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases. J\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  And as a quick follow -up to that, you know, obviously, the Federal Reserve walking this very complicated fine line, trying to avoid a recession.  For the consumers out there who are worried about their jobs in a possible recession, what do you say to that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, I , you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent , while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very strong.  If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that \u2019s strong within the context of U .S. potential economic output .  So\u2014and we expect that to continue .  And to the    extent the data come in different, then, of course, our policy will adapt .  But we do believe that our policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down inflation .  We believe that we can do so while sustaining a strong labor market . The labor market is \u2014it\u2019s not strong in the ordinary sense of the word.  We have not seen a labor market where there are 1.7 job openings for every une mployed person or where there , if you add job openings to those who are employed, that \u2019s actually substantially a larger number than the size of the workforce , than the number of people who actually count themselves as in the workforce .  So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply.  And when that happens, prices go up.  And they\u2014so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back.  And we don \u2019t think we need to do this alone .  There will be other factors helping that happen.  But we cer tainly are prepared to use our tools \u2014and we will .

May I ask about the sanctions on Russia and , specifically , the freezing of the central bank assets ?  Of course, that raises a similar risk for other sovereigns around the world and their biggest companies , potentially.  Any conce rns about , in the long term, how this might affect the dollar \u2019s status as the preeminent global reserve currency ?  And in the past couple of weeks, have you had to deliver any kinds  of reassurance to other central bankers around the world?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally very in favor of these sanctions .  But let me say this:  S anctions are really the business of the elected government, and that \u2019s true everywhere .  So the A dministration and the Treasury    Department, in particular, and other agencies \u2014they create these sanctions.  We\u2019 re there to provide technical expertise, but they\u2019 re not , it\u2019s not our decisions .  And so I \u2019m reluctant to comment on sanctions really much because, again, they \u2019re not for us  [to decide].  We have a very specific mandate.  And these are really the province of elected governments, as I mentioned .  So I\u2019d have to leave it at that .  Sorry \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Hi, Chair Powel l.  Thanks for taking the question.  You\u2019ve been talking a lot about rising wages, which, on the one hand, is a great  thing, but are we possibly seeing the beginning of a wage \u2013price spiral?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So the way I would say i t is this:  We, first of all, I would agree with the premise that wages moving up is a great thing.  You know, that \u2019s how the standard of living rises over time.  And , generally , it\u2019s driven over long periods by rising productivity.  But what we have now, if you look at these , the wage increases that we have, we look at a\u2014we \u2019re blessed with a range of measures of wages that all measure different things.  But right now, they\u2019 re all showing the same thing, which is that the increases \u2014not the levels , but the i ncreases\u2014are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent  inflation, our goal , over time .  And that may be \u2014we don\u2019 t know how persistent that phenomenon will be .  It\u2019s very hard to say.  And that \u2019s really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage \u2013price spiral;  is that something that \u2019s going to start happening and become entrenched in the system ?  We don \u2019t see that.  You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on, those wage i ncreases looked like they may have slowed down to a  normal level .  But it comes back to, you know, what I \u2019m saying here \u2014which is , there \u2019s a misalignment of demand and supply,    particularly in the labor market.  And that is leading to wages moving up at ways  that are not consistent with 2 percent  inflation over time .  And so we need to use our tools to, you know, guide inflation back down to 2 percent .  And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily strong labor market .  We think this labor market can  handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy.  And the overall economy can as well . But, ye s, wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent  inflation, but it \u2019s good to see that moving up.  But it wouldn\u2019 t be sustainable over too long of a period to see them moving up that much higher .  And that \u2019s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.  We expect to get more labor supply .  We did  last time .  We got more than we expected during the last cycle .  This time, we \u2019ve gotten much less than expected .  So it\u2019s not easy to predict these things .  But we do expect that we \u2019ll get people coming back in the labor market, particularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people\u2019 s lives, something we all wish .  But , so that \u2019s how we think about it . MICHELL E SMITH .  Thank you.  For the last question, we \u2019ll go to Don Lee at the L .A. Times \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  I think you said to the Senate earlier this month that, in hindsight, the F ed should have moved earlier .  And it sounds like today that you don\u2019 t think that the F ed is late .  And , just wanted to get your clarification on that .  And if it is, if you still think that the Fed is \u201cbehind the curve,\u201d  how much \u201c behind the curve \u201d is it?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Right .  So w e are not \u2014we don\u2019 t have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight in actually implementing real -time decisions in the world .  So, you know, so the question is \u2014the right question is, did you make the right decisions based on what you knew at the time?   But that\u2019s not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now .  So I think if we    knew now \u2014of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages , really , and the inflation resulting from them in collision with, you know, very strong demand, if we kne w that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes .  It would have been appropriate to move earlier .  Obviously, it would be .  But, again, we don\u2019 t have that luxury . And then, so , but that \u2019s a separate question from your other question, which is \u201c behind the curve .\u201d  And, you know, I don\u2019 t have the luxury of looking at it that way.  You know, we are , we have our tools \u2014powerful tools \u2014and the Committee is very focused on using them .  We\u2019 re acutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market .  And what I saw today was a C ommittee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability, in particular, and prepared to use our tools to do that .  We\u2019 re not going to let high inflation become entrenched .  The costs of  that would be too high.  And we \u2019re not going to wait so long that we have to do that .  No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on, in order to get inflation back down. So, frankly, the need is one of getting back up, getting rates b ack up to more neutral levels as quickly as we practicably can and then moving beyond that, if that turns out to be appropriate .  And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense t hat, [in] people \u2019s [contributions to the] SEPs , they do write down levels  of interest rates that are above their estimate of the longer -run neutral rate .  And there \u2019s also a range of estimates, too, as you will see if you look at the details of the SEP .  But thanks for your question.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Okay.  Thank you all .

Despite a strong economy, the Committee raised its policy interest rate and plans to reduce the size of its balance sheet in support of its goals of maximum employment and price stability, citing robust economic activity in the previous year.The Omicron variant initially slowed economic activity, but cases have since declined sharply, resulting in a mild and brief slowdown. Despite the downside risk of the invasion of Ukraine, FOMC participants still anticipate solid growth. The labor market has strengthened significantly, with employment increasing by over a million jobs in the first two months of the year. The unemployment rate reached a post-pandemic low, and improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, benefiting workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as African Americans and Hispanics. However, labor supply remains subdued, leading to difficulties for employers in filling job openings and causing wages to rise at their fastest pace in many years.FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent and staying near that level. However, inflation remains well above the 2 percent goal due to supply disruptions, higher energy prices, and the impact of the Ukraine crisis, making it likely that it will take longer for inflation to return to the desired level.The FOMC projects higher inflation rates than previously anticipated, with risks weighted to the upside. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by their mandate for maximum employment and stable prices. They will continue to adapt their policy to the evolving economic environment and anticipate ongoing increases in the federal funds rate. The appropriate level of the federal funds rate is projected to be higher than previously estimated. The Committee made progress on reducing their securities holdings and will announce the beginning of balance sheet reduction soon. They will consider the broader context in markets and the economy when making decisions about interest rates and the balance sheet.The implications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine for the US economy are uncertain, as it may lead to higher global oil and commodity prices, disrupt supply chains, tighten credit conditions, and add uncertainty to an already challenging moment. The Federal Reserve will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and strive to restore price stability while being attentive to the risks of potential inflationary pressure.The American economy is robust and capable of managing stricter monetary policy. Our actions have wide-ranging impacts on communities, families, and businesses nationwide, and we are committed to fulfilling our public mission of achieving maximum employment and price stability. Thank you, and I am eager to address any questions you may have.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': How is the Federal Reserve considering the risks of going too fast and causing a recession versus going too slowly and allowing inflation to become embedded?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell believes that the probability of a recession in the next year is not high. Aggregate demand and the labor market are strong, and household and business balance sheets are also strong. The economy is well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy while achieving price stability and sustaining a strong labor market.", "QUESTION: How much of the markdown to GDP in the SEP is due to the Fed's actions and will it have a quicker impact?\n\nANSWER: Chair Powell believes that the Fed's actions are not a major factor in the markdown. The lower GDP forecast is mainly due to the effects of the war in Eastern Europe, such as higher oil and commodity prices. Monetary policy works with a lag, but the 2.8 percent growth forecast is still considered strong.", "'QUESTION': What would trigger the Federal Reserve to go faster or slower on rate hikes?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve considers every meeting as a live meeting and will assess evolving conditions. If they determine it is appropriate to remove accommodation more quickly, they will do so, although the specifics cannot be determined at this time.", "'QUESTION': When do you expect to see inflation start to come down and how will you signal it?\n'ANSWER': Inflation was expected to peak in the first quarter of this year and then start to come down in the second half. However, short-term upward pressure from higher oil and natural gas prices, supply chain issues, and the war in Ukraine may delay the relief. Inflation is still expected to remain high this year, lower than last year, and then come down more sharply next year.", "QUESTION: How concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy firming by leading real rates to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the economy?\n\nANSWER: The Committee understands the need for rate increases and shrinking the balance sheet. The economy is strong with momentum in the labor market, and we expect growth to continue. While real rates may not provide much restraint now, many forecasts show tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint in the future. We are focused on achieving our goals, including price stability.", "'QUESTION': How much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the Fed itself raising rates?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell asked the reporter to repeat the first question.", "'QUESTION': How much do you expect inflation to come down as a direct result of the Fed's actions?\n'ANSWER': Inflation coming down is influenced by factors other than our policy, such as supply chain improvements and base effects. We are looking for month-by-month inflation to decrease, which will be impacted by various factors like the shift from goods to services and better supply chains. Monetary policy's impact on inflation and growth will be seen in 2023 and 2024, and the market has already priced in rate increases.

How will the rate hikes be paced and what is the threshold for doing 50 at one meeting?\n\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell does not discuss his individual projection. The pacing of rate hikes is not discussed or agreed upon, but there are seven remaining meetings this year and seven rate hikes. The shrinkage of the balance sheet may also be equivalent to another rate increase. The decision on front-end loading or steady increases has not been made. The number of rate increases may exceed seven or eight according to the SEP. The decision to raise interest rates more quickly will be based on data, inflation outlook, and judgment.", "'QUESTION': How far behind the curve of inflation does the Federal Reserve believe it is?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve has the necessary tools and a plan to raise interest rates steadily and reduce the balance sheet. They will take steps to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched while supporting a strong labor market. If needed, they are open to moving more quickly.", "'QUESTION': What impact has there been on your job, given the fact that [indaudible]?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell stated that they lost the reporter in the middle of the question, so there was no response provided.", "'QUESTION': Has the lack of confirmation for you and Governor Brainard affected your job or the Fed's ability to handle inflation?\n'ANSWER': None whatsoever.", "'QUESTION': How concerned is the Committee about the notable pickup in services inflation and to what extent does it alter the Committee's confidence in long-term inflation expectations and the balance of risks for raising interest rates?\n\n'ANSWER': The Committee is closely monitoring the increase in services inflation and noticed it in the last meeting. They expected services inflation to rise back to pre-crisis levels, but it has spread more broadly across services, which is concerning. The Committee is committed to using its tools to restore price stability.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain the logic behind the forecasts in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) that suggest the economy will continue to run hot and inflation will take longer to return to price stability?\n\n'ANSWER': The SEP is not a plan or something we voted on. However, if you look at the forecasts, many expect the economy to reach or exceed the longer-run neutral interest rate by the end of this year, which would remove accommodation for monetary policy. Additionally, the balance sheet runoff will contribute to tighter policy. The expectation is that wage increases will eventually decrease and no longer push up inflation, and the committee is determined to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.", "'QUESTION': How do higher fed rates reduce consumer demand without increasing unemployment?\n'ANSWER': By reducing the number of job openings and aligning demand and supply in the labor market, there would be less upward pressure on wages and a decrease in labor shortages. This would slow demand, allow supply to recover, and bring inflation down, while maintaining a strong labor market and restoring price stability.", "'QUESTION': What is the outlook for older workers returning to the labor force and how would that impact wages and inflation?\n'ANSWER': It's uncertain, but in the previous cycle, labor force participation exceeded expectations during a tight labor market. While retirees reentering the workforce is not common, increased labor force participation is welcome. The current labor market offers higher wages and job mobility, which could attract more workers. This could help alleviate wage pressures and potentially mitigate inflation risks. However, other factors and the Fed's policy also play a role in addressing inflation.", "'QUESTION': Since financial conditions have tightened since the last FOMC meeting, with equity prices down, Treasury yields up, bond spreads risen, yield curve flattened, and the dollar up, is this welcomed and would you like to see more to achieve your goals?\n\n'ANSWER': Policy works through financial conditions to reach the real economy, and the previous accommodative monetary policy was appropriate during the pandemic. It is now necessary to move away from those policies and towards more normal levels of financial conditions, which will involve some tightening and higher interest rates.", "'QUESTION': When you say \"move to a more normal setting\" for financial conditions, does that mean you want financial conditions to tighten further from where we are now?\n'ANSWER': Yes, we consider a broad range of financial conditions and expect them to adjust in sync with monetary policy over time. It's not about any specific condition, but rather a broad range of conditions reflecting various factors. As we tighten policy, we aim for less accommodative financial conditions to transmit to the real economy.", "'QUESTION': Can you give us any more details about the balance sheet discussion at this meeting, such as whether there will be a cap on runoffs or an increase in those caps over time?\n'ANSWER': We made excellent progress in agreeing on a plan to shrink the balance sheet and are now in a position to finalize and implement it. The decision on timing will consider the broader financial and economic context, and we want to avoid adding uncertainty. The framework will be similar to the last time, but faster and earlier in the cycle. More details will be provided in the minutes of the meeting.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed trying to do other than bring inflation down? Are they going to keep raising rates until it comes down to an acceptable level?\n'ANSWER': The Fed's new framework does not cause them to wait longer to raise interest rates. If they see low unemployment and high employment without inflation, they won't raise rates until they actually see inflation. The framework is about anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent. They are now looking to use their tools to restore price stability.", "'QUESTION': If unemployment rises significantly, does that temper the desire to keep raising rates?\n'ANSWER': The goal is to restore price stability while sustaining a strong labor market. Price stability is essential for achieving a strong labor market. Maximum employment cannot be sustained without price stability. The focus is on price stability particularly because the labor market and economy are strong, and the economy can handle tighter monetary policy.", "'QUESTION': How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on future Fed policy going to address the inflation that average Americans are feeling at the stores on a daily basis?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell assures that they are fully committed to bringing inflation back down and sustaining economic expansion. They understand that higher prices have real effects on people's well-being, especially those who spend most of their income on essentials. Raising interest rates will gradually slow down demand and better match it with supply, bringing inflation down over time.", "'QUESTION': What is your message to consumers who can no longer afford the basics due to high inflation?\n'ANSWER': We understand the pain caused by high inflation and are committed to restoring price stability. We will use our tools to bring inflation back down to our target of 2 percent by raising interest rates and shrinking our balance sheet. This may slow the economy, but the strong labor market can handle interest rate increases.", "QUESTION: What do you say to consumers worried about their jobs in a possible recession?\n\nANSWER: Our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent while sustaining a strong labor market. The economy is very strong and forecasts show continued growth. If data differs, our policy will adapt, but we believe our current policy is appropriate and can bring down inflation while maintaining a strong labor market.", "'QUESTION': Any concerns about how the sanctions on Russia and the freezing of central bank assets might affect the dollar's status as the global reserve currency?\n'ANSWER': Sanctions are the responsibility of elected governments, and central bankers generally support them. The Federal Reserve provides technical expertise but does not make decisions on sanctions. The Fed's mandate is specific, and the issue of sanctions is the province of elected governments.", "'QUESTION': Are we possibly seeing the beginning of a wage-price spiral?\n'ANSWER': While rising wages are positive for the standard of living, the current wage increases are running well above the 2 percent inflation goal. However, we do not see a wage-price spiral becoming entrenched in the system. There is a misalignment of demand and supply in the labor market, leading to unsustainable wage increases. We expect more labor supply as COVID becomes less of a factor.", "'QUESTION': Do you still think the Fed is \"behind the curve\" and if so, how much?\n'ANSWER': We don't have the luxury of hindsight in real-time decision-making. If we knew now what would happen with supply blockages and resulting inflation, it would have been appropriate to move earlier. But we are focused on restoring price stability and won't let high inflation become entrenched. The need is to get rates back up to more neutral levels quickly.", "'QUESTION': Thank you all. Thanks, Mr. Chair.\n'ANSWER': The reporter expresses gratitude to the attendees and acknowledges the Chair's presence."]}
