As you mentioned, almost all of the FOMC participants believe that the first rate hike will com e this year.  But two of your colleagues believe that 2016 is th e appropriate time, the IMF h as called on 2016 as the appropriate time for liftoff as well, and markets seems to plac e a greater probability of liftoff in January than they do in September.  So what are\u2014what is the mis understanding here?  What is\u2014what do they have wrong, and why do you think that waiting u ntil 2016 is a mistake? \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, there are  obviously a range of opinions, b oth in the market and among Committee members, at this time on what the appropriate s tance of policy is likely to be later this year and next year.  But , importantly, the\u2014when the people write down their dots in the SEP, they\u2019re making forecasts a bout what unfolding data is like ly to show.  But the participants will all be\u2014their views will evolve with unfolding data. For all of us, the appropri ate policy decision is going to be d ata dependent, and all of us will be looking at incoming data .  And our opinions about the a ppropriate timing of normalization are likely to shi ft as we look at how the data ev olves.  Differences in the appropriate assessments of the appropriate stance of policy\u2014in addition to reflecting different views on the outlook, there are a s et of risks that all of us n eed to weigh in judging on the\u2014judging the appropriate time of t he beginning of normalization.   On the one hand, waiting too long to begin normalization can r isk significan tly overshooting  our inflation objective given the lags in the operation of mone tary policy.  And, on the other ha nd, beginning too early could risk derailing a recovery that we ha ve worked for a very long time t o try to achieve.  And so we\u2019re trying to assess those risks. But I want to emphasize, sometimes too much attention is placed  on the timing of the first increase in the federal  funds rate.  And what should matt er to market participants is the entire trajectory, the entire expected trajectory of policy.  A nd, again, while our actual policy decisions will have to evolve in  light of what really does happ en in the economy, the Committee, as you can see by the SEP projections , currently anticipates th at conditions will evolve in the economy in a manner that will make  it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate gradually over time. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Madam Chair, I  wonder if you might characterize  the progress made towards fulfilling the Fed\u2019s tw o criteria.  Are you somewhat mo re confident, not confident at all that you\u2019re moving towards 2 percen t?  Has there been a lot of improvement in the labor market?  Some improvement?  And how shoul d we judge when those two crite ria have been fulfilled\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, it\u2019 s a judgment that the Committee is\u2014will  have to make, and, as I\u2019ve said previously and as we \u2019ve said in the statement, it will depend on a wide range of data and not on any simple indicators .  So I can\u2019t provide you\u2014it wo uld be wrong for me to provide you a roadmap that said something as simple as, if the unemploy ment rate declines to X, that then the labor market will ha ve improved enough for us to begin  to raise policy. Obviously, we have to look at the pace of job creation.  We hav e to look at what\u2019s happening to labor force particip ation, to part-time employment  for economic reasons, to job openings, to the pace of quits, t o wage inflation, and other in dicators of the state of the labor market.  I did say when we agreed that labor market slack has d iminished to some extent in the intermeeting period, and, clearl y, over a longer span of time, over the last several years, obviously we\u2019ve made considerab le progress in moving toward our  goal of maximum employment.  So, in spite of the f act that there is some progre ss on that front, the Committee wants to see some further progre ss before feeling that it will be appropriate to raise rates.  On inflation, again, there has b een some progress, in the sense  energy prices appear to have stabilized.  Now, inflati on is going to\u2014overall inflation is likely to run at a low level for a substantial period of time.  The  big declines in energy prices came toward the end of last year and the beginning of this year , and they\u2019re not going to wash o ut of the inflation data until late in this year.  But the fact that en ergy prices have stabilized mea ns that the pressure from that source is diminishing.   In addition, the dollar appears to have largel y stabilized.  An d, with respect to core inflation, it has been runni ng under our 2 percent objective, b ut declining import prices have been reducing that pressure.  I be lieve that as the labor marke t continues to improve and as our confidence in that forecast rise s, at least for me, my confiden ce will also rise that inflation will move back up toward 2 percent.  I e xpect that to, over time, pu t upward pressure on core inflation.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chair Y ellen.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.   Two questions if I may.  First , I wanted to ask you about a c omment that New York Fed President William Dudley made recently that, in retrospect,  the Fed should have raised interest rates more aggre ssively during the 2004\u20132006 cycle.  T his was in a footnote to a speech he gave.  I wonder if you agree with  that and whether there are  any lessons from the 2004\u20132006 cycle that should be applied t oday.  And, second, relating to C ongress, the Fed has resisted past efforts in Congress to pass measur es like an \u201cAudit the Fed\u201d bi ll or a measure to subject the Fed to a policy rule.  There\u2019s now a Shelby bill out there.  I wond er if there\u2019s anything in that that you can accept and, more broadl y, whether there\u2019s anything you could point to that Congress can do to make the Fed a more effective institution and a more acco untable institution.  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Okay, so on the f irst question you asked about t he 2004\u201306 rate increase cycle.  Throughout that  period, the Fed indicated that  rates would rise at a measured pace, and that turned out to be, I believe, 17 meetings, with 2 5 basis point increases at each meeting.  As I\u2019ve emphasized, previously, we have\u2014absolutely do  not expect to follow any mechanical 25 basis points a meeting, 25 basis point every othe r meeting, no plan to follow any type of mechanical approach to r aising the federal funds rate.  We will evaluate incoming conditions and move in the manner that we regard as appropriate .  So that\u2019s one lesson.  You   know, conceivably, I think, with t he benefit of hindsight, it m ight have been better to raise rates more rapidly or more duri ng the 2004\u201306 cycle.  You know, I\u2019m n ot certain of that judgment, but I think there\u2019s a case to be made. You asked about Audit the Fed and the Shelby bill.  The Shelby bill has a title in it that addresses a number of issues  pertaining to the Fed.  I suppose I would ask, what exactly is the problem?  We place high priorit y on being an accountable and tr ansparent central bank, and I think that if you compare the t ransparency of monetary policy d ecisions in the Federal Reserve with other central banks, we are  one of the most transparent ce ntral banks in terms of the information that we provide to t he public in a whole variety of  ways.  To my mind, the Fed is accountable, and we work well as  an institution.  I\u2019m not certa in what the problem is that needs to be addressed\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.   First question is also referencing som ething that Bill Dudley said re cently, which is to do with the use of the balance sheet in tight ening monetary policy.  He suggest ed that the short rates should be hiked some way from the zero lo wer bound before the Fed continu es\u2014considers ending reinvestments.  I wondered if  you could give a little bit more clarity on how the Fed intends to approach the issue of ending rei nvestments on its balance sheet .  Would you, for instance, see any argument for tapering the e nd to reinvestments to smooth th e profile of maturities in the portfolio?  The second question is really on this point of \u201cgra dual\u201d\u2014you\u2019ve used this term today in the opening statement.  Is the term \u201cgradual\u201d on its way to becoming official guidance from the Fed?  Is this something we should start to expect to see po pping up in official FOMC statements in future?  Thanks. \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So let me start w ith the balance sheet and our r einvestment policy.  We issued a normalization state ment giving principles of normal izing policy, and what we said at that time is that we expected  to reduce or cease reinvestmen t at some time after we had begun the process of normalizing polic y by raising our target for the  federal funds rate.  We said the timing of that would depend on economic and financial condition s, and the Committee has really not made any further decisions  about how it\u2019s going to go about  doing that, so President Dudley was expressing his own personal po int of view.  But this is a m atter that the Committee has not yet decided, and I can\u2019t provide  any further detail.  It\u2019s obvi ously something we will be thinking about. Let\u2019s see, you asked about \u201cgrad ual.\u201d  So, in a sense, we alrea dy have a statement.  The last paragraph of the Federal Ope n Market Committee statement s ays:  \u201cThe Committee currently anticipates that, eve n after employment and inflation  are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping  the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee view s as normal in the longer run.\u201d  That\u2019s kind of a mouthful.  It\u2019s a long sentence, but I think the s pirit of that sentence is con sistent with my use of the word \u201cgradual,\u201d and it is consistent  with what you see in the Summar y of Economic Projections.  Participants are projecting\u2014obvious ly there is a lot of uncerta inty, but they\u2019re projecting increases that average ar ound 100 basis points per year.  Now, that\u2019s not a promise, it\u2019s conditional on their economic forecasts, and those forecasts ma y prove to be wrong and may change.  But at this time, the assessmen t that participants have of the economy suggest to them that the appropriate pace of normalization to keep the economy on track to meet our objectives will be gradual, in that sense. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Cook with Bloom berg Television.  Madam Chair , if I could, just given your discussions over the past two days with your colleag ues, the state of the economy right now, the improvements you\u2019ve seen, do you think it\u2019s stil l likely that we\u2019ll see a rate increase this year?  And to fo llow on that, something Ylan ment ioned\u2014that is, the comment from the IMF recently, earlier t his month, and the encouragemen t you got from the IMF to hold off on raising rates until next ye ar.  Specifically, they said\u2014 your colleague Madam Lagarde mentioned specifically the risk\u2014 that even though there\u2019s a risk  of slight inflation by doing that, that there was concern that a ra te hike could trigger market vo latility, with fin ancial stability consequences that go well  beyond the U.S. borders.  How do you respond to those concerns?  Are you factoring in that interna tional context to your decisio nmaking?  And was  it appropriate for the IMF to make those kinds of specific recommendations?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Okay.  So your first qu estion was about a rate i ncrease this year.  You know, again, the Committee tries to  give an indication in the S ummary of Economic Projections about how economic conditions will unfold, their best projectio ns of that and what the appropriate policy will be give n in light of those expectations .  And, clearly, most participants are anticipating that a rate increase this  year will be appropr iate. Now, that assumes, as you can s ee, that they\u2019re expecting a pic kup in growth in the second half of this year and furth er improvement in labor marke t conditions.  And we will all be\u2014we will be making decisions  however that depend on the actua l data that we see in the months ahead.  So, certainly, we could see data in the months a head that will justify the expectations that you see in the  so-called dot plot.  But, agai n, the important point is, no decision has been made by the Committee about what the right timing is o f an increase.  It will depend on   unfolding data in the months ah ead.  But, certainly, an increas e this year is possible.  We could certainly see data that would justify that. In terms the IMF guidance, you know , I believe the IMF plays a very useful role by undertaking reviews of the econom ic policies of all of its memb ers.  Obviously, there is a range of opinion among outside observers a nd market participants as w ell as among the Committee\u2019s participants, as you can see in the SEP, about how economic con ditions are likely to unfold and, consequently, the appropriate ti ming of an initial rate hike.  I think, however, we all agree, and the IMF agrees, that policies should be data dependent, and the  Committee is always doing its best to assess the implicati ons of incoming data.  I would poin t out that we have had incoming data since that report was writt en.  But, again, I want to emph asize\u2014and I think the IMF would agree with this\u2014that the impor tance of the timing of a first de cision to raise rates is something that should not be overb lown, whether it\u2019s September or Decembe r or March\u2014what matters is the entire path of rates.  And, as I\u2019ve said, the Committee ant icipates economic conditions that would call for a gradual evolut ion of the fed funds rate toward  normalization. With respect to international sp illovers, this is something tha t we have been long attentive to.  Obviously, we have to put in pl ace a policy that is approp riate to evolving conditions in the U.S. economy, but we can\u2019t promise that there will not be volat ility when we make a decision to raise rates.  What we can do is to do our very best to communic ate clearly about our policy and our expectations to avoid any type  of needless misunderstanding  of our policy that could create volatility in the market and potential spillovers as well to em erging markets, and I have been trying to do that now for some ti me.  I\u2019ve been doing my best t o make good on that pledge\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Marty Crutsi nger with the Associated Press.   You just talked about the fact that you can\u2019t prom ise that there won\u2019t be volat ility in the markets.  There seem to   be two schools of thought.  One is that the Fed learned from th e mistakes made in the\u20142013 with the taper tantrum, and tha t you\u2019re going to telegraph this  so well that that will limit it.  And the more pessimistic school of thought seems to be that when yo u do start raising rates, they\u2019ve been low for so long that it\u2019s goi ng to be\u2014make the taper tantr um seem mild by comparison.  Which camp are you falling in on that\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: I think our experien ce suggests that it\u2019s hard t o have great confidence in predicting what the market reaction will be to Fed decisions , and there have been surprises in the past.  I don\u2019t think the Comm ittee anticipated that its dec ision would cause the taper tantrum.  And all I can say is that uncerta inty in the markets at this po int about long-term rates doesn\u2019t appear to be unusually high, and w e can only do what is in our power to attempt to minimize needless volatility that could have repercussions for other cou ntries or for financial stability more generally, and that is to attempt to communicate as clearly as we can about our policy decisions, what they will depend on, and what we are looking at. We will be responding to incoming data.  We\u2019ve tried to make th at clear.  And I think it\u2019s clear that the market is als o responding to incoming data, and you can see that in daily market reactions to surprises in t he economic data.  And, of course, n one of us can quite forecast what incoming data will be\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Your latest economic projections show that  you expect the unemployment rate\u2014or, many officials expect the unemployment ra te\u2014to fall more slowly this year and then to fall, by impli cation, more quickly next year.  Could you talk about what has changed in your assessment of the  labor market and how that inf luences the path of policy\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we are\u2014productiv ity growth has been\u2014is a fact or that affects the pace of improvement in the labor  market.  Productivity growth h as been extremely slow for the   last couple of years, and I think, in part, the pace of improve ment in the labor market that we\u2019re projecting reflects th e notion that there\u2019s likely to be some p ickup in the pace of productivity growth.  Obviously, that\u2019s someth ing that\u2019s quite uncertain, an d it\u2019s conceivable that if productivity growth disappoints\u2014 something I hope that we won\u2019t see, because that has very negative implications  for living standards\u2014we could conceivably  see faster improvement in the labor market. But, in addition, there are other margins of slack that don\u2019t s how up in the unemployment rate.  Labor force participation that has, at least, is\u2014appears  to be depressed, at least to some extent, because of cyclical wea kness, and the fact that labor f orce participation rate has remained roughly stable for the last year  or so when there\u2019s an underlyi ng downward trend suggests that some slack is being taken up by, in a sense, improved or dimini shed cyclical impact on labor force participation.  I expect t hat to continue, and I would ex pect also to see some improvement in the degree of part-time employ ment that\u2019s for economic reaso ns\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jonathan Spi cer with Reuters.  To your point,  Madam Chair, on needing more decisive evidence i n order to initiate the first r ate hike, how close do you feel the economy is to full capacity now ?  And given that, you know, emp loyer costs and monthly wages are at a pace that\u2019s at a six-y ear high now, what is the risk\u2014o r, how does the risk change that inflation could strengthen qui cker than you\u2019re expecting\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So the Committee es timates that the longer-run n ormal level of the unemployment rate is 5.0 to 5.2.  A t 5.5 percent, where we have  an unemployment rate that still exceeds the Committee\u2019s best attempts to estimate what is a nor mal unemployment rate for this economy, and, as I mentioned, the re appear to be unusually larg e elements of slack over and above that in the form of somewha t still-depressed labor force participation and part-time work   for economic reasons.  So I think it \u2019s fair to say that most me mbers, most participants on the Committee, wouldn\u2019t judge yet\u2014al though some might\u2014that most wou ldn\u2019t judge us to be at, quote, \u201cmaximum employment.\u201d  Wage increases are still running a t a low level, but there have  been some tentative signs that wage growth is picking up.

I think it\u2019s not yet definitive, but that is a hopeful sign. Still, however, inflation\u2014not onl y headline, but, stripping out  food and energy underlying inflation, core inflat ion\u2014is still running below the  Committee\u2019s objective.

An d for all of the households that were underwater, those house  price increases are improving  their financial condition, although, of course, at the same time, it\u2019s making housing less  affordable for those who look to buy.   At the same time, housing overall, given the low levels\u2014still l ow level of mortgage rates, remains quite affordable.  I thi nk credit availability remains quite constrained for mortgages.  Anyone who doesn\u2019t have a pristine credit rating is\u2014finds it ve ry difficult at th is point to qualify for a mortgage, and I think we\u2019re  seeing quite a bit of relucta nce, given the job market and given what the history of what\u2019s  happened to house prices, of young p eople to want to buy homes.  We\u2019ve seen them delay marriage and wanting to have the flexibil ity to move.  So the demand for multifamily housing to rent is very high, and rent prices are m oving up, I think, because of that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Jeremy To rdjman with Agence France-Presse .  I have a question on Europe.  As you know, the re is a growing political gridlock on Greece, and the scenario of a \u201cGrexit\u201d is getting every day more likely.  So ho w concerned are you by these developments?  Do you feel it coul d impact the global and the U .S. economy, and could it influence in anywhere\u2014in any way, sorry, when you will decide t o increase the interest rates\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well I\u2014unfortunate ly, Greece and its creditors a re faced with very difficult and consequential de cisions at this point and in the days ahead, and my hope is that they will continue to work together to try to find a solution to the , you know, current difficulties and impasse.  Obviously, European lead ers place great value on pres erving European monetary, economic, and political integrati on, and the Greek people have made clear that it\u2019s important to them to remain in the euro area .  So this is a very difficult s ituation. In the event that there is not  agreement, I do see the potentia l for disruptions that could affect the European economic ou tlook and global financial marke ts.  I would say that the United States has very limited direct e xposure to Greece, either throu gh trade and financial\u2014or financial channels.  But to the extent that  there are impacts on the euro -area economy or on global   financial markets, there would undoubtedly be spillovers to the  United States that would affect our outlook as well\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  C hris Condon from Bloomberg Ne ws.  Madam Chair, I\u2019d like to come b ack to the topic of consumer spe nding.  Consumer spending has been very disappointing for ma ny months in the U.S. economy.  I \u2019m wondering, do you think there has been a meaningful shift, and one that will persist in  the behavior of households, with respect to spending and savings ?  Or would you be more inclined  to look at the recent more encouraging retail sales figures  and see perhaps a return of th e American consumer there\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I think in rece nt weeks we have received data  that suggest that consumer spending is growing at a moderate pace .  I\u2019d say, you know, car sales, for example, were very strong.  Part of it proba bly represents payback for w eak sales during the winter months, but, nevertheless, the pa ce of car sales has been stron g.  And recent readings on retail sales and on spending on services  have suggested an improvement  in the pace of consumer spending.  There are questions at this poi nt about just how much impact we \u2019ve seen of lower energy prices on consumer spending.  The d ecline in oil prices transla tes into an improvement in household income, on average, of  something like $700 per househ old, and I\u2019m not convinced yet by the data that we have seen the  kind of response to that that  I would ultimately expect.  And I think it\u2019s hard to know at this poi nt whether or not that refle cts a very cautious consumer that is eager to add to savings and t o work down borrowing.  Or, in par t, some survey evidence suggests that consumers are not yet confid ent that the improvement they\u2019 ve seen\u2014the decline in their need to spend for energy, for  gasoline\u2014that that\u2019s going to be something that will be permanent.    They may think it\u2019s a transito ry change and not yet be respondi ng.  So I think the jury is out there, but I think we have see n some pickup in household spendi ng\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Barnes, Fox B usiness.  Madam Chair, I want ed to shift over to the decision in the AIG case this past Monday.  And in it, the judge in the case said in his opinion, quote, \u201cThere is nothing in the Federal Reserve Act or  any other federal statute that would permit a Federal Reserve Ba nk to take over  a private corp oration and run its business as if the government were the owner, ye t that is precisely what the F ederal Reserve Bank of New York did,\u201d and the judge went on to cite the replacement of AIG \u2019s chief executive officer and taking control of AIG\u2019s business  operations.  I wanted to ask y ou, did the Fed break the law in assisting AIG back in the crisi s?  And if this decision is uphe ld on appeal, how does that affect the Fed\u2019s toolbox?  How does it a ffect its ability to help firm s in trouble in a future financial crisis?  Would it make that ki nd of assistance illegal, or woul d you have to get Congress to change the law and make a fix?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So the Federal Res erve strongly believes that it s actions with respect to AIG in 2008 were legal, proper,  and effective, and it believ es that they were necessary, given the threat that a disorderly f ailure of that company would have  likely implications for the economy, for the flow of credit to households, in businesses in  the economy.  And it believes that the\u2014we believe that the terms of  that intervention were tough, and appropriately so, in order to protect taxpayers from the risks  that those rescue loans presen ted at the time they were made. Now, I should emphasize that D odd-Frank changed our 13(3) autho rity and said that the Federal Reserve may not in a futur e crisis intervene to attempt  to address the issues of a particular company.  At the same time, it gave the government a  set of new tools that it could use   in a situation like the AIG situ ation or Lehman to try to resol ve such a situation that poses systemic risks in an orderly way. The\u2014I\u2019d just say at this point, t he Federal Reserve under Dodd- Frank can continue, if necessary, in some future crisis to engage in broad-based progr ams similar to the program we had in effect\u2014the programs we  had in effect in 2008 to provide support for the issuance of asset-backed securities that enabled l oans to small businesses and to  students and for credit cards and, you know, for credit throughout t he economy, or to support the issuance of commercial paper.  At this point, I believe we are w orking with the Department of Justice to decide on next steps\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Madam Chair, Mark H amrick with Bankrate.com.  So  much discussion about rising rates s eems to focus on the potential n egatives, and I\u2019m  wondering if you could talk a little b it if you envision some possible unintende d benefits of higher rates.  And one of the things I\u2019m thinking about i s the fact tha t savers have s uffered through so many years of miserly returns, and many may be actually anticipating in a pos itive way seeing a better return on their investment.  Thank you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So let me say, to my  mind, the most important po sitive is that it\u2014I believe a decision to raise rates  would signify very clearly th at the U.S. economy has made great progress in recovering from the tr auma of the financial crisis and that we\u2019re in a different place.  I think, hopefully, that would be  something that would be confi dence-inducing for many households and businesses. From the point of view of savers , of course this has been a ver y difficult period.  Many retirees\u2014and I hear from some a lmost every day\u2014are really suffe ring from low rates that they had anticipated would bolster the ir retirement income.  This, y ou know, obviously has been one of the adverse consequen ces of a period of low rates.   The\u2014you know, we have a good reason for having kept rates at th e levels that we have.  We\u2014our charge from Congress is to pursue the goals of maximum e mployment and price stability.  That\u2019s what we\u2019ve  been doing.  And obviously there are benefits from a strong economy to every household in the e conomy, including savers, fr om having a better job market and a more secure economy.  But, ye s, when the time comes for u s to raise rates, I think there will be some benefits tha t flow through to savers\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times .  Just to follow up on that question, I think a lot of s avers, people on fixed incomes , were hopeful that they would see a rate increase if not this meeti ng, soon.  What sort\u2014what kind o f assurances can you give them and people out there who think the  Fed is never going to raise rates?  I\u2019ve got some e-mails today from people saying, \u201cThey\u2019re never going to raise rates.\u201d  What  kind of assurance can you give to people who are waiting for that to happen\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: I can\u2019t give an i ronclad promise, but I think it \u2019s clear from our Summary of Economic Projections t hat we anticipate that the eco nomy will grow, that the labor market will improve, that inflation will move back up to 2 perc ent as we\u2014is our objective over the medium term.  And if economi c conditions unfold in the way that most of my colleagues and I anticipate, we see it as appr opriate to raise rates.  And, as  you can see, the largest number of participants anticip ate that those conditi ons should be in plac e later this year. Obviously, we have to\u2014you know, there  can be surprises\u2014that mig ht not happen.

Could you  shed some additional light on how large rev erse repo operations are likel y to be in their in itial phase?  And,   additionally, how important are f inancial conditions to the pac e of the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle?  I mean, how important is the mark et\u2019s reaction in determining how  fast or slow and the ultimate endpoint of a Fed tightening cycle\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, with respect  to\u2014you asked first about overni ght reverse repos.

However, it is our expectation and plan that fair ly quickly after liftoff we w ill reduce the level of the overnight RRP facility, and we have a variet y of ways in which we can do that. With respect to market reactions , we always, in evaluating the economic outlook, have to take account of financial conditi ons, whether it\u2019s the level of  long-term interest rates or the value of the dollar in assessing the economic outlook.  To the extent  that there are market reactions and market movements, whether they\u2019 re in reaction to decisions of o urs or in reaction to other events\u2014foreign events or unfolding economic conditions\u2014we will always take those into account in deciding on the appr opriate path of policy\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Beckne r of MNI.  Madam Chair, good to see  you.  You mentioned that the dollar ha s stabilized.  And, in fact, since mid-March, I believe it\u2019s given up a good bit of its gains from last summer.  To what extent now do you think that there will be an ongoing drag from the dollar, taki ng into account this dollar r etreat?  And, overall, how important is the dollar exchange  rate in monetary policy these days relative to the past\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I think we s till are, since last summer\u2014ha ve seen an appreciable increase in the valu e of the dollar vis-\u00e0-vis most of our trading partners, including emerging markets.  So it is a si gnificant appr eciation of the d ollar, and I think we have seen that   it\u2019s had a negative effect on net e xports and so served as some thing of a drag on the economy, and probably that drag is going to c ontinue for some time to co me.  So it is a factor affecting the outlook.  In addition, import pri ces for non-oil imports contin ue to fall, and I thi nk that\u2019s serving to push down core inflation a littl e bit.  Eventually, I expect  that impact to ebb, but it is a factor affecting the outlook. That said, we obviously have no target for the dollar.  We take  movements in the dollar and its economic impact as one of  many factors affecting the ou tlook.

The timing of the initial increase will be determined on a meeting-by-meeting basis, and monetary policy will remain accommodative to support progress towards employment and inflation objectives.The economy experienced a slow period in the first quarter, with little change in GDP. Household spending and business fixed investment slowed, and net exports had a negative impact on growth. However, despite these challenges, the fundamentals for household spending remain positive, and the Committee expects moderate GDP growth with job gains and lower energy prices supporting consumer spending. The labor market has shown progress towards maximum employment, although at a slower pace than last year, with job gains averaging 210,000 per month. The unemployment rate remained unchanged, but the labor force participation rate increased, and a broader measure of unemployment has continued to improve. However, there are still signs of cyclical weakness in the labor market, such as a low participation rate, elevated involuntary part-time employment, and subdued wage growth.Progress has been made, but there is still room for improvement. Inflation remains below the objective due to lower energy prices and import price declines, but with recent stabilization in energy prices and an improving labor market, inflation is expected to gradually move back towards the objective.The FOMC projects a slight decrease in growth projections for 2015, but an increase for next year. Unemployment rate projections are higher for this year, but are expected to decline in 2016 and 2017. Inflation is projected to be low this year, but is expected to rise in the following years. The Committee reaffirms that the current target range for the federal funds rate is appropriate, and any decision to raise it will depend on progress towards employment and inflation objectives.The FOMC continues to assess a wide range of information, including labor market conditions, inflation pressures, and financial developments, in order to determine when it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate. While some progress has been seen, economic conditions do not yet warrant an increase in the rate, and the Committee anticipates only gradual increases in the future.Participants discussed the reasons for the federal funds rate being below its normal level, attributing it to the lingering effects of the financial crisis. They emphasized that the path of the rate is dependent on economic conditions and could be adjusted based on evolving circumstances. Additionally, the Committee will continue reinvesting proceeds from securities to maintain accommodative financial conditions.", "question_answer_summary": ["QUESTION: What is the misunderstanding about the appropriate timing for the first rate hike and why is waiting until 2016 a mistake?\nANSWER: There are a range of opinions on the appropriate stance of policy, but the decision will be data dependent. Waiting too long risks overshooting the inflation objective, while beginning too early could derail the recovery. The focus should be on the entire expected trajectory of policy, which currently anticipates a gradual increase in the federal funds rate.", "'QUESTION': Can you characterize the progress made towards fulfilling the Fed's two criteria and how should we judge when those criteria have been fulfilled?\n'ANSWER': The Committee will have to make a judgment based on a wide range of data, not simple indicators. Factors such as job creation, labor force participation, part-time employment, job openings, wage inflation, and other indicators of the labor market are considered. Some progress has been made, but further progress is desired before raising rates. Inflation has shown some progress, with stabilized energy prices and a largely stabilized dollar. As the labor market improves, confidence in inflation rising towards 2 percent will also increase.", "'QUESTION': Should the Fed have raised interest rates more aggressively during the 2004-2006 cycle and are there any lessons from that time that should be applied today? Is there anything Congress can do to make the Fed more effective and accountable?\n'ANSWER': The Fed does not plan to follow a mechanical approach to raising interest rates and will evaluate incoming conditions to determine the appropriate course of action. It is uncertain whether raising rates more rapidly during the 2004-2006 cycle would have been better. The Fed believes it is already transparent and accountable, and it is unclear what problem Congress is trying to address.", "'QUESTION': How does the Fed intend to approach the issue of ending reinvestments on its balance sheet? Is there an argument for tapering the end to reinvestments?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has not yet made any decisions on how it will end reinvestments on its balance sheet. President Dudley's comments were his personal opinion. The Committee will be thinking about this issue, but no further details can be provided at this time.", "QUESTION: Do you think it's still likely that we'll see a rate increase this year? How do you respond to the IMF's concerns about market volatility and international consequences? Was it appropriate for the IMF to make those recommendations?\n\nANSWER: Most participants anticipate a rate increase this year, assuming a pickup in growth and labor market improvement. The timing will depend on actual data. The IMF's guidance is useful, but opinions differ on economic conditions and timing. The Committee agrees policies should be data dependent. The timing of the first rate hike is not as important as the entire path of rates. The Fed is attentive to international spillovers and aims to communicate clearly to avoid volatility and potential consequences.", "'QUESTION': Which camp are you falling in on the issue of market volatility when raising rates?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen states that it is difficult to predict market reactions to Fed decisions and there have been surprises in the past. The Committee did not anticipate the taper tantrum. The Fed will attempt to minimize volatility by communicating clearly about policy decisions and responding to incoming data.", "'QUESTION': What has changed in the assessment of the labor market and how does it influence policy?\n'ANSWER': The slow productivity growth in recent years has affected the pace of improvement in the labor market. If productivity growth picks up, there could be faster improvement in the labor market. Additionally, there are other factors, such as depressed labor force participation and part-time employment, that contribute to the assessment of the labor market.", "'QUESTION': How close do you feel the economy is to full capacity now and what is the risk that inflation could strengthen quicker than expected?\n'ANSWER': The Committee estimates that the unemployment rate is still above the normal level for this economy, indicating there is still slack in the labor market. While there have been some signs of stronger wage growth, inflation is still below the Committee's objective. Additional strength in the labor market and the economy is needed to have confidence in inflation reaching 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': How comfortable are you with the rapid increase in rents and house prices, and does it impact monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': The increase in house prices is restoring wealth for many households, but it also makes housing less affordable for buyers. Overall, housing remains affordable due to low mortgage rates, but credit availability for mortgages is constrained. Young people are hesitant to buy homes due to the job market and history of house price fluctuations, leading to high demand for rental housing and increasing rent prices.", "'QUESTION': How concerned are you by the growing political gridlock in Greece and the possibility of a \"Grexit\"? Could it impact the global and U.S. economy and influence the decision to increase interest rates?\n'ANSWER': Greece and its creditors face difficult decisions, and I hope they can find a solution. If there is no agreement, there could be disruptions that affect the European economy and global financial markets. The U.S. has limited direct exposure to Greece, but there would be spillovers to the U.S. economy if there are impacts on the euro-area economy or global financial markets.", "'QUESTION': Do you think there has been a meaningful shift in the behavior of households with respect to spending and savings?\n'ANSWER': Recent data suggests that consumer spending is growing at a moderate pace, with strong car sales and improvements in retail sales and spending on services. However, it is unclear how much impact lower energy prices have had on consumer spending, as some consumers may be cautious and unsure if the decline in energy costs is permanent. Overall, there has been some pickup in household spending.", "'QUESTION': Did the Fed break the law in assisting AIG back in the crisis?

Would it make that kind of assistance illegal, or would you have to get Congress to change the law and make a fix?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve believes its actions with AIG in 2008 were legal, necessary, and effective. Dodd-Frank changed the Fed's authority, prohibiting future interventions for specific companies but providing new tools to address systemic risks. The Fed can still engage in broad-based programs to support credit issuance in future crises.

A strong economy benefits everyone, including savers, through a better job market and a more secure economy.", "'QUESTION': What kind of assurance can you give to people who are waiting for the Fed to raise rates?\n'ANSWER': While Chair Yellen cannot provide a guarantee, she states that based on the Summary of Economic Projections, the Fed expects the economy to grow, the labor market to improve, and inflation to reach 2 percent. If conditions unfold as anticipated, it is seen as appropriate to raise rates later this year, as indicated by the majority of participants.

I mean, how important is the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reaction in determining how fast or slow and the ultimate endpoint of a Fed tightening cycle?\n'ANSWER': The Committee intends to ensure that overnight reverse repos are available in large quantity at liftoff to ensure a smooth transition. However, shortly after liftoff, we plan to reduce the level of the overnight RRP facility. Financial conditions, including long-term interest rates and the value of the dollar, are always taken into account when evaluating the economic outlook and determining the appropriate path of policy. Market reactions and movements are also considered in this decision-making process.", "'QUESTION': To what extent will the ongoing dollar retreat have a drag on the economy and how important is the dollar exchange rate in monetary policy compared to the past?\n'ANSWER': The significant appreciation of the dollar has had a negative effect on net exports and served as a drag on the economy. The dollar's impact on the economy is a factor affecting the outlook, but the Committee believes the economy will do well enough to likely call for some tightening later this year.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the Fed is doing everything it can in its CRA implementation to give access to blighted communities to basic banking services? Do you think it needs to be doing more?\n'ANSWER': We take CRA very seriously and evaluate it for the banks we supervise. We have guidelines and actively work with community groups and banking organizations to address community needs. However, we are constantly looking for ways to improve the implementation of CRA."]}
