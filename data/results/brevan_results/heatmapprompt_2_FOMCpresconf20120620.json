Mr. Chairman, looking back on the last four years of Fed policy, I think it \u2019s probably fair to say it has been bold and yet at the same time halting .  You did QE1 and then you stopped and then you did QE2.  You did \u201c Operation T wist\u201d and you told us it was going to end in June ; now you\u2019 ve extended it .  How would you respond if , several years from now, a young MIT graduate student came forward and said, \u201c You know what the problem with Fed  policy was during this period is it was too incremental, and that the reason why the economy underperformed was because of that incrementalism.\u201d   And what do you think the dangers are right now that today \u2019s action is also too incremental?  June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  4 of 22\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well , of course, you know, we cut the federal funds rate in a continuous fashion until December of 2008.  And since then, we \u2019ve been operating with nonsta ndard monetary  tools , including asset purchases and extension of maturities .  By their nature, these tend to be lumpy .  We haven \u2019t done them in a continuous way .  But our view of the effects of these programs on the economy is that the total stock of outstanding securities in our portfolio is what determines the level of accommodation that the economy is receiving .  So in that respect, it wouldn\u2019 t be really a start and stop ; rather, whenever we have stopped purchasing , the level of accommodation that was already in the system remains there until conditions warrant further action .  Now, underlying all this, of course, is the fact that  the outlook has changed .  Like many other forecasters, the Federal Reserve was too optimistic early in the recovery about the pace of recovery .  And we \u2019ve had to add additional accommodation going forward, as we have seen, in fact , that the headwinds have  kept the recovery from being as strong as we would like .  But, again, by the nature of these unconventional tools, they are \u2014tend to be more discreet in their size , but they continue to have accommodative effects even after the pattern of purchases has end ed\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Don \u2019t you worry about incrementalism now?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, we \u2019ve taken a step today , which is a substantive step , which will provide additional accommodation for the economy .  And , moreover, we have stated that we \u2019re prepared  to take further steps if necessary to promote sustainable growth and recovery in the labor market .  So, we are prepared to do what \u2019s necessary .  We are prepared to provide support for the economy.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Mark Felsenthal with Reuters .  Mr. Chair man, many analysts have characterized today \u2019s step as somewhat modest .  Your own outlook has a much lower GDP June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  5 of 22  projection.  The unemployment rate in your outlook is \u2014shows possibly no improvement at all in the unemployment rate through the end of this year .  The program itself is smaller and of shorter duration than the original O peration T wist.  Given this weaker outlook, why such a modest program?  And when you say you are prepared to take further action, which is a stronger characterization than in your la st meeting, does that mean you are prepared to do a full -on new asset purchase program?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, there \u2019s been a great deal of economic news since our last meeting .  The incoming data were somewhat disappointing \u2014but not entirely clear how t o read them .  We had issues with weather and seasonal adjustment and other factors .  Meanwhile, Europe has had additional problems .  We \u2019ve seen some of those effects in financial markets .  So, I think, there is some case to be made for making some additional judgments about where the economy is going .  That being said, the step we took, the extension of the maturity e xtension program , I think, is a substantive step , and it will provide some additional support .  And yes, additional asset purchases would be among the things that we would certainly consider if we need to take additional measures to strengthen the economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman, I \u2019d like to ask you to respond to a different set of criticisms .  This criticism\u2014whi ch you hear from Capitol Hill and  Wall Street and different places \u2014is that the Fed has already pushed interest rates to an extraordinarily low level, a historically low level, and that there isn \u2019t anything more that the Fed can do to help the recovery .  That \u2014the criticism is that the Fed at this point should stand down and let Congress or the White House attend to the economy \u2019s ailments or let market forces attend to the economy \u2019s ailments .  What do you think of those arguments , and how  would you respond to them?  June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  6 of 22\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNA NKE: Well, as I \u2019ve said many times, monetary policy is not a panacea.  Monetary policy by itself is not going to solve our economic problems .  We welcome help and support from any other part of the government, from other economic policymakers .  So, collaboration is \u2014would be great .  I wouldn\u2019 t accept the proposition, though, that the Fed has no more ammunition .  I do think that our tools, while they are nonstandard, still can create more -accommodative financial cond itions, can still provide support for the economy, can still help us return to a more normal economic situation.  That being said , again, any other support  that is forthcoming, any other economic policies that are undertaken that are helpful in terms of making our economy stronger are welcome .  But I do think that monetary policy still does have some capacity to strengthen the economy by easing financial con ditions.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Mitt Romney recently said that QE2 had a relatively little impact on the economy .  He said that was in part because of the P resident \u2019s policies, and he said that QE3 was unwarranted and could have negative effects .  Do you agree that QE2 had little effect on the economy?  Do you think the P resident \u2019s policies has had an effect on the effectiveness of monetary policy?  And do you think it \u2019s appropriate for a presidential candidate to comment on the future path of monetary  policy?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, I \u2019ll just say first that we think that both of the asset purchase programs, so -called QE1 and QE2, did have significant effects on asset prices and financial conditions .  And although there were certain problems in transm ission \u2014for example, the housing market has not been as responsive as it \u2019s been in some times in the past \u2014we do think that they were both effective in providing support for the economy , and in particular, so-called QE2 ended what looked to be an incipient deflation problem when we first introduced it .  So, I do think those have been eff ective , and as I said to Mr. Hils enrath, we think that these kinds June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  7 of 22  of programs can still provide additional support .  With respect to the rest of your questions, I just want t o reiterate that the Federal Reserve is nonpartisan, we are very serious about taking our decisions based on purely economic grounds without political considerations, and we \u2019ll continue to do that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks .  Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A. Times.  Long -term interest rates, mortgage rates are already at historic lows .  How much more help can an extension of Operation T wist do and\u2014to lower interest rates?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, the interest rates are quite low , and they \u2019re being pushed down more by safe -haven flows and other factors .  That being said, I think we can lower interest rates more .  But beyond that, Operation T wist and asset purchases work also through other channels .  In particular, by acquiring securities in the market and bringi ng them onto the Fed\u2019s balance sheet , we essentially induce investors to move into substitute  securities .  So, for example, an investor who sells a T reasury security to the Fed may end up buying a corporate bond instead, and so the effect will be to lower corporate bond rates and corporate spreads .  Or a bank may, having sold its T reasury securities, may decide to make a loan instead .  So, it \u2019s not just the effect on the long- term interest rate, but there \u2019s a broader set of effects that feed through other a sset prices, other interest rates, other spreads, and provide a broader ease in financial conditions which is supportive to the economy.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.

We have to get, I think, further information about the state of the economy, about where things  are going, about what \u2019s happening in Europe .

I know  that you\u2019 ve said that European policymakers are the first line of defense for the European debt crisis, but under what circumstances would the Fed decide to get more directly involved or coordinate action with other centr al banks?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, as you say, the Europeans are the first line .  Europe is a wealthy area.  They have adequate resources to address these problems .  They are very committed to addressing these problems because keeping the e uro zone together, keeping the euro-zone trading bloc together is very important to the economies of those countries, so we leave to them the leadership .  The Federal Reserve is very much involved in talking with and consulting with European leaders .  I talk frequently to central bankers in Europe, including Mario Draghi and others .  We try to provide whatever help and support we can.  We did , of course , coordinate earlier in the provision of the dollar swaps to other central banks, which have been useful in reducin g pressures in dollar funding markets and allowing European banks to continue lending in dollars , including to U .S. borrowers .

Sir, you had talked about trying to get maybe a little help from some of the other branches of government , so that leads to the questions about the \u201c fiscal cliff .\u201d  Have you seen any evidence that the lack of progress on resolving the fiscal -cliff issue is having an impact on the economy right now?  Is it slowing economic growth June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  10 of 22  right now, job creation as we saw last year during this very same debate ?  And if you\u2019 re not seeing it, and if you haven\u2019 t seen it yet, when could we \u2014might we start to see it hit the economy and hurt the economy?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, I think it\u2019 s still a bit early, but as we move forward in the year, we do anticipate that the uncertainty associated with the so -called fiscal cliff will have some economic effects .  We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be government contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contract s would still be in place come January and making employment decisions based on that .  More generally, financial markets don \u2019t like uncertainty and, particularly, uncertainty of this magnitude , and that, I think, will be a negative .  So that uncertainty is there, that \u2019s goi ng to be an issue .  I think most importantly , though, is that Congress get the policy right .  I\u2019ve talked about three elements for fiscal policy .  The first is to do no harm as far as the recovery is concerned, to try to avoid a fiscal cliff that would sig nificantly damage the recovery .  But second, to maintain the effort to achieve a sustainable fiscal path over the longer term .  And third, to use fiscal policy effectively \u2014to have a better tax code, to make good use of government spending programs and make them efficient and effective, and so on.  So I think if Congress does all those things, the ultimate benefits would be substantial\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Cook with  Bloomberg Television.  If I could follow up on my colleague Peter Barnes \u2019s question regarding the fiscal cliff, just listening to your answer here, how beneficial would it be for the U .S. economy right now, given some of the ta lk on Capitol Hill that the law makers and the A dministration deal with the fiscal -cliff issues, perhaps temporarily kick th e can down the road into next year, deal with i t sooner rather than later .  June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  11 of 22  Would that end \u2014limit, at least , some of that uncertainty in the short  term ?  Would that  be beneficial given the state of the economy at this present moment?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, that\u2019 s a difficult problem .  I\u2019m not entirely sure .  On the one hand, a little clarity would probably be helpful for the reasons that I described, because people are uncertain about what \u2019s going to happen.  On the other hand, investors I know would like to see Congress take actions that put us on a long -term, sustainable fiscal path , and simply kicking the can down the road without any other indication of what might be done, what kinds of policies might be enacted , could be a negative for sentiment be cause it might induce people to worry more about the seriousness of Congress in addressing our fiscal issues\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Shah ien Nasiripour with the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, one crit ique of the Fed \u2019s accommodative actions over the past few  years has been  that it\u2019s helped those with the least propensity to spend \u2014the wealthy , large businesses and corporations \u2014while the Fed \u2019s impact on those with the most propensity to spen d\u2014the cash -strapped and  middle -income households \u2014has been muted.  I was  hoping that you could perhaps address this criticism, particularly with a focus on access to credit.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Sure .  Well, access to credit is a major issue , there\u2019 s no question about it .  Mortgage access is much tighter than it \u2019s been for a lo ng time .  Even credit card access is more restricted than it has been in the past .  And that \u2014what that does is , to some extent , it mutes the impact of the Fed \u2019s actions .  That being said, I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s at all accurate to say that Federal Reserve polic y is not helping the broad public .  First of all, many Americans are able to take advantage of lower interest rates .  Many people have refinanced or bought homes .  Others have taken out loans to buy cars .  Auto loans are cheap and broadly available .  So, there has been impact through lower interest rates, but I think more broadly is the indirect June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  12 of 22  effects .  If a firm has a low cost of capital, and we \u2019ve seen a lot of corporate borrowing in the last couple of years, then they \u2019re more likely to expand, to add c apital, to add products , and , consequently, they are more likely to hire .  And although, again, the extent to which the payrolls have increased in the last few years has been disappointing , there have been significant increases , and the unemployment rate has come down by 2 percentage points .  Some of that comes from the broad impact of Fed policy on spending , on investment , and those effects affect the broad public indirectly by promoting hiring and by promoting demand for products that people are producing \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, thanks .  Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers .  If you could flesh out a little bit more detail about what \u2014where you think the choke points are in the economy .  SIFMA yesterday had their midyear outlook conference call in which they blamed a full percentage point of the slowdown on fiscal cliff and, more importantly , Europe and said, you know, much bigger pass -through than anyone anticipated .  Today , the Business Roundtable said, Europe , not so much;  it\u2019s basically the economy .  The CEO of Boeing said, clearly , we\u2019re already t rimming  jobs, we \u2019re already cutting back ; everybody else in the a erospace, he thinks, is doing the same .  What are you hearing?  Are you on t he phone with people  your predecessor was given to calling  occasionally ?  What is your sense of where the choke points are that are continuing to thwart  hiring?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Sure .  I gave a list of  some of the headwinds in my opening remarks .  I do think that the European situation is slowing U .S. economic growth.  First of all, Europe is , if not in a recession in every country, certainly many countries are in recession, and that affects our trade with Europe and the demand for our products .  More br oadly, the effects of European concerns on financial markets have added to volatility, have brought down stock prices, have increased credit spreads, and generally have been a negative for economic growth .  June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  13 of 22  So that has been an issue .  And more broadly, we \u2019ve seen some slowing in global economic growth more generally , including in Asia , which also has reduced somewhat our ability to export .  So that \u2019s one set of concerns that \u2019s been important .  I\u2019d mentioned two others, I think, as being primarily important.  One is housing .  Housing usually plays a very important role in economic recovery, both through construction itself and related industries, but also because higher house prices increase consumer wealth and promote consumer spending .  Housing does seem to  be doing somewhat better .  There are some good signs in housing , but nevertheless , we are not getting the size of the boost, the amount of help in the recovery that we would normally get from a housing recovery .  The other area is, as you indicated, is fi scal.  And that happens at all different levels :  federal, state, and local .  Notwithstanding programs earlier on, in the last year or two  and going forward we have been seeing fiscal consolidation.  P articularly at the state and local level , of course, ti ght budgets have led to a lot of layoffs and cancellation of projects and so on.  I understand that these are necessary steps from the perspective of individual states and localities .  I\u2019m not criticizing that;  it\u2019s just a fact, though, that these contract ions are affecting the pace of growth in the broader economy .  So I think those would be the main things I would point to, and put them all together , and you have an economy which is growing less quickly than it normally would following  a recession of the magnitude that we saw.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Marcy Gordon with the AP .  Given the environment that you\u2019 ve sketched out and the fact that interest rates are at historically low points, would it make sense\u2014would it be an option for t he government to issue more long -term debt at this point and take advantage of that?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, the government is very gradually increasing the duration of its debt \u2014the T reasury , I mean \u2014and it \u2019s been doing that for some period of time .  June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  14 of 22  Ther e\u2019s a bit of an issue here , which is that what the Federal Reserve is doing with the program we announced today, the maturity extension p rogram , is we \u2019re taking longer -term debt off the market in order to induce investors to move into other assets  and to l ower longer -term interest rates .  To the extent that the T reasury actively sought to lengthen duration of its borrowing, it would, to some extent, offset the benefits of that \u2014of those policies .  So my understanding of what the T reasury is doing is that the y have a plan, they \u2019re sticking to that plan, and therefore , on the margin , the effects of the Fed \u2019s actions can be felt.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Darren Gersh with Nightly Business Report .  You clearly seem to be waiting on the labor market .  Can you be a little mo re specific?  What exactly are you looking for?  Is there a rate of job growth you need to look \u2014to see?

Mr. Chairman, when we\u2014when you speak of the fiscal cliff , typically you don\u2019 t differentiate between the automatic tax-hike aspect of that and the automatic spending cuts , which leaves the impression that you are giving equal weight to both sides .  Some would contend that the automatic tax hikes would be more one rous.  How do you parse the relative importance of those two aspects?  And if I may be permitted, I am also curious to know how the Fed is going to conduct open market operations, if, as the New York Fed statement says, by the end of this year, they will e ssentially have no short -term securities to use.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, on the fiscal cliff, I mean, just the way that the programs are set up, the dollar amount associated with the tax e xpirations \u2014tax -cut expirations, including the payroll tax cut and so on, is larger than the spending cuts, as I understand it .  But I\u2019m not making any judgment about individual programs .  The point here is that putting all these things together, you have a very substantial withdrawal of income from the economy that will affect spending and will affect the ability of the economy to recover in the short  run.  Now, again , in making decisions about, you know, how to modify those automatic changes, Congress obviously has to look at the long  run, you know \u2014what is the most effic ient tax structure, what \u2019s the best way to spend our limited resources?  Those are tough decisions that Congress has to make, but in terms of the fiscal cliff, in terms of what\u2019 s going to happen in January, the \u2014it\u2019 s really the total of both spending cuts a nd tax increases which has the impact, which not only we, but others like the Congressional Budget Office , have identified as being a concern .  We\u2019 ll still be able to do open market operations with our securities, even if the amount of short -term debt is very low .  And indeed, of course, over time, the \u2014as securities come close to maturation, we will have other securities that are of short duration.

There have been a lot of questions raised as to whether the Volcker rule would have helped prohibit the trading loss of J .P. Morgan .  Given that regulators are in the middle of the rule -writing process and also examining what exactly went wrong, as a supervisor, do you think at this moment it \u2019s the right time to perhaps \u201c pump the brake s,\u201d so to speak, and slow down the rule -writing process or has this recent episode really made it a stronger case for proceeding with the Volcker r ule expeditiously ?  And , secondly, if I may, since \u2014given that you\u2019 ve suggested that regulators might be late on the rule , surpassing the July 21st deadline, could you perhaps give us a target on when regulators are looking to release the rule?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, on the second question, it \u2019s a five -agen cy rule , I believe, and so a lot of coordination and cooperation is needed, and we had something like 18,000 comment letters, so it\u2019 s been a very difficult process in terms of the amount of work that has to be done, amount of coordination that has to be done, so I don\u2019 t have a date for you .  I think if there \u2019s a silver lining to the events you referred to, it may  be that there\u2019 s some things we can learn in terms of writing the rule and thinking about how it would work .  One aspect of our rule that I think w ould have been important in the context of the loss is that , in the rule, a bank would be required to provide a plan in advance explaining how the hedge was going to be done, how it was  going to work .  It would be necessary to have an auditing process to m ake sure that , in fact , that was being followed, that there were adequate risk management and governance rules to oversee the process , and it would be necessary that compensation for the executives involved in the management of the position would not be su ch that it would incentivize them to take proprietary positions .  So, one aspect of the rule that might have been relevant \u2014and again, we June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  17 of 22  are still looking at that situation , as are the OCC and others \u2014would have been the control, the governance aspects of it, and that might have potentially changed the outcome\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mark Gregory, BBC .  How much worse will the situation in Europe have to get before it starts seriously denting the prospects for recovery in the American economy, and thus really chang ing the direction of Fed \u2019s policymaking?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, we hope it doesn\u2019 t get worse .  I think it \u2019s already one of the factors that has been a drag on U .S. recovery \u2014not the only factor by any means, there are a number of others that I mentioned, but it has been having an effect, and it \u2019s been having an effect on the economies of other countries as well, countries that export to Europe .  So it is a significant issue .  We are hopeful that Europe will take additional measures and do all that \u2019s neces sary to stabilize the situation and to provide the basis for an ongoing stable structure that \u2014in which banks and sovereigns are both stabilized, in which there \u2019s a program for growth, and in which fiscal arrangements are clear \u2014are made much clearer .  So there\u2019 s a lot of work to be done .  Again, we think that the policymakers in Europe have very strong incentives to get this right, and we \u2019re very hopeful that they will get it right, and we are in close contact with them as they work on these issues .  But aga in, it is also important for us to be prepared for any further problems that might emerge from Europe , and we have been doing that .  For example, you know, we recently did our stress  tests of the large bank holding companies  to make sure they had enough ca pital even in the face of a severe financial crisis or a European crisis .  We have been monitoring the exposures of banks and other financial institutions to Europe and, of course , monitoring the situation there very closely .  So we are hoping for the best , we are hoping that European policymakers will take the additional steps they need to take to stabilize the situation .

Greg Robb, MarketWatch .  I just want ed to get back to lending and credit .

Would that be something you\u2019 d start  here?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: We ll, we \u2019re very interested in it , and we \u2019re certainly going to follow it.  The details are not yet available.

And, specifically, what are the relative costs and benefits of doing more QE versus more maturity extension?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, the \u2014in terms of the inflation forecasts, again , I think it should be said, as a preliminary poin t, that economic projections have a lot of uncertainty June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  19 of 22  about them .  We talk about that uncertainty in the survey of e conomic projections .  So we shouldn\u2019 t take a false sense of precision from those numbers.  That being said, there is an issue about whether  or not there \u2019s sufficient stimulus in the economy .  As I mentioned earlier, one problem is that we are now at the zero bound, and that the types of unconventional programs that are available are\u2014we know less about them , they have various costs and risks , and, for that reason, you may get a different amount of financial accommodation in this kind of regime than you would in one where short -term interest rates can be varied freely .  So I think that \u2019s really a critical issue.  Now, in terms of t he costs, I would list , briefly , large asset purchases increase the size of our balance sheet  and therefore ultimately will make exit a more extended process .  Large asset purchases \u2014which means that the Fed owns a larger share of a particular type of asset \u2014may have im plications for market functioning , which in turn  might affect the ability of the Fed to have stimulative effects on the economy .  There are some financial stability issues that we are monitoring and that have to be taken into account .  So any kind of asses sment of appropriate policy must look both at the outlook for the economy and for \u2014and at the cost s and risks associated with new measures, new steps that might be taken.  That being said, again, I think at this point, we still do have considerable scope to do more , and we are prepared to do more .  We \u2019ll continue to monitor the economy and see how things evolve .  And if \u2014again, we \u2019re looking primarily at the labor market in this respect\u2014i f we\u2019re not seeing a sustained improvement in the labor market, that would require additional action .   June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  20 of 22  In terms of balance sheet actions, we are unlikely to do more maturity extension for a while because we have taken that about as far as we can .  So we would have to take other types of steps in order to add to the amount of stimulus in the economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chairman .  I\u2019m Toshiki Yazawa from Nikkei .  I hear a lot of conversations on liquidity trap in U .S.  That  was a familiar concept in Japan after a bubble burst in the l ost decades .  Is U .S. economy in liquidity trap?  A nd if that happens, how could economy escape from here?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, the U .S. economy is in a situation where short -term interest rates are close to zero .  And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short -term interest rates, the usual approach .  It\u2019s been one of the themes of my own work for a long time , including  some of the work I did on the B ank of Japan , that central banks are not out of tools once the short -term interest rate hits zero .  There are additional steps that can be taken .  And we have demonstrated through both communications techniques \u2014guidance about future policy , which is something the Japanes e have done as well , by the way\u2014a nd through as set purchases, also something the Bank of Japan has done , that central banks do have some ability to provide financial accommodation to support their recovery even when short -term interest rates are close to zero .   That being said, as I mentioned to Mr. I p, these nonstandard policies are less well understood, and they do have some cost s and risks .

Chairman, are you at all concerned that O peration T wist could affect banks \u2019 earnings and their willingness to lend?  Does it undercut your ability to increase credit to consumers?  June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  21 of 22\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Credit to consumers?  No, I don\u2019 t think so.  If\u2014take, fo r example, I \u2019ve heard the argument that by lowering interest rates, you make it unattractive to lend.  I don \u2019t think that \u2019s quite right .  What we\u2019 re lowering is the safe interest rate, the T reasury rate.  That should make it even more attractive for banks , rather than to hold securities , to look for borrowers and to earn the spread between the safe rate and what they can earn by lending to households and businesses .   So I think that macropolicy and monetary policy can, i n fact , support lending .  Now, the question arises in some context s whether there are other barriers to lending as exist , for example, in some parts of the mortgage market .  But lower interest rates on securities and other types of assets, all else equal, would induce banks to look for highe r-yielding returns, higher -yielding assets in the form of loans to household and businesses.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Merril l Goozner, the Fiscal Times .

They have also extended their program of lengthening the maturity of their securities holdings through the end of the year, which will put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and support economic recovery.The economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace despite challenges from Europe, the housing market, credit constraints, and fiscal restraint. However, employment gains have been smaller and the unemployment rate remains high, leading to lowered projections for economic growth and slower progress in reducing unemployment.The FOMC projects inflation to range from 1.2 to 1.7 percent for 2012 and 1.5 to 2.0 percent for 2014. These projections are based on individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': How would you respond if a young MIT graduate student claimed that the problem with Fed policy during this period was that it was too incremental and that the economy underperformed because of that incrementalism? What are the dangers of today's action being too incremental?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has used nonstandard monetary tools, such as asset purchases and extension of maturities, which may appear to be start and stop, but the total stock of outstanding securities in our portfolio determines the level of accommodation. The Fed has had to add additional accommodation due to the slower pace of recovery, but these unconventional tools continue to have accommodative effects even after the pattern of purchases has ended.", "'QUESTION': Don't you worry about incrementalism now?\n'ANSWER': We have taken a substantive step today to provide additional accommodation for the economy. We are prepared to take further steps if necessary to promote sustainable growth and recovery in the labor market. We are ready to provide support for the economy.", "'QUESTION': Why is the program announced by the FOMC considered modest given the weaker economic outlook?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC took into account various factors such as disappointing economic data, issues with weather and seasonal adjustment, and problems in Europe. The extension of the maturity extension program is seen as a substantive step to provide additional support, but the possibility of additional asset purchases is still being considered if needed.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed's response to the criticism that they have already pushed interest rates to a historically low level and there is nothing more they can do to help the recovery?\n\n'ANSWER': The Fed acknowledges that monetary policy alone cannot solve economic problems and welcomes support from other parts of the government. However, they believe that their nonstandard tools can still create accommodative financial conditions and provide support for the economy. They also believe that monetary policy can strengthen the economy by easing financial conditions.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree that QE2 had little effect on the economy? Do you think the President's policies has had an effect on the effectiveness of monetary policy? And do you think it's appropriate for a presidential candidate to comment on the future path of monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': We believe that both QE1 and QE2 had significant effects on asset prices and financial conditions, providing support for the economy. While there were some issues in transmission, they were effective in addressing deflation concerns. The Federal Reserve remains nonpartisan and makes decisions based solely on economic grounds.", "'QUESTION': How much more help can an extension of Operation Twist do to lower interest rates?\n'ANSWER': Operation Twist and asset purchases not only lower long-term interest rates, but also induce investors to move into substitute securities, lowering corporate bond rates and spreads. It also encourages banks to make loans instead of holding Treasury securities, providing a broader ease in financial conditions that supports the economy.", "'QUESTION': Can you reassure Americans that the current economic situation won't last as long as the Great Depression?\n'ANSWER': It is our intention to prevent the current economic situation from lasting indefinitely. Although unemployment is still high, it has decreased from its peak. We believe that people are finding jobs, but not at the desired rate. If the labor market does not continue to improve, we are prepared to take further action.", "'QUESTION': Why is the Federal Reserve not doing more to address the high unemployment rate?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke explains that the Federal Reserve has already taken a significant step by extending the maturity extension program until the end of the year, which he believes is a meaningful additional measure.", "QUESTION: Did the projections include the step mentioned?\nANSWER: Each individual has their own optimal policy path, so more information will be provided in the minutes. However, further information about the economy, Europe, and the associated costs and risks of nonstandard programs is needed before taking additional steps.", "'QUESTION': Under what circumstances would the Fed decide to get more directly involved or coordinate action with other central banks in the European debt crisis?\n'ANSWER': The Fed believes that European policymakers are the first line of defense and have adequate resources to address the crisis. The Fed is committed to consulting and providing support to European leaders, as seen in the coordination of dollar swaps. They are prepared to work together if it can be done constructively, but currently, they are mostly in consultation mode.", "'QUESTION': Have you seen any evidence that the lack of progress on resolving the fiscal-cliff issue is having an impact on the economy right now? Is it slowing economic growth and job creation?\n'ANSWER': It is still early, but the uncertainty of the fiscal cliff is expected to have some economic effects. Firms are already making employment decisions based on uncertainty about government contracts. Financial markets dislike uncertainty, and Congress needs to get the policy right to avoid significant damage to the recovery and achieve a sustainable fiscal path.", "'QUESTION': How beneficial would it be for the U.S. economy to temporarily deal with the fiscal-cliff issues and delay addressing them until next year?\n'ANSWER': It is a difficult problem and there is uncertainty about the outcome. While some clarity would be helpful, simply delaying the issue without any indication of future actions could be negative for sentiment and raise concerns about Congress' seriousness in addressing fiscal issues.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve address the criticism that its actions have primarily benefited the wealthy and large businesses, while having a muted impact on cash-strapped and middle-income households in terms of access to credit?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke acknowledges that access to credit is a major issue, with mortgage and credit card access being more restricted. However, he argues that lower interest rates have allowed many Americans to refinance or buy homes, and cheap auto loans have also been available. Additionally, the low cost of capital has encouraged corporate borrowing, leading to expansion, job creation, and increased demand for products.", "'QUESTION': What are the choke points in the economy that are hindering hiring?\n'ANSWER': The European situation is slowing US economic growth, affecting trade and demand for products. European concerns have added to volatility in financial markets, bringing down stock prices and increasing credit spreads. Slowing global economic growth, particularly in Asia, has also reduced our ability to export. Housing recovery is not providing the expected boost, and fiscal consolidation at all levels is affecting economic growth.", "'QUESTION': Given the low interest rates, would it make sense for the government to issue more long-term debt and take advantage of that?\n'ANSWER': The government is gradually increasing the duration of its debt, but there is an issue. The Federal Reserve's program aims to lower long-term interest rates by taking longer-term debt off the market. If the Treasury actively sought to lengthen its borrowing duration, it would offset the benefits of the Fed's actions. The Treasury has a plan and is sticking to it, so the effects of the Fed's actions can still be felt.", "'QUESTION': What specific indicators is the Committee looking at to determine if the labor market is improving?\n'ANSWER': The Committee reviews all labor market indicators, including unemployment, labor participation, and other measures of labor market activity, to determine if the labor market is improving in a sustainable way. They consider the overall trend and whether the improvement is long-lasting, rather than focusing on month-to-month variations.", "'QUESTION': How do you differentiate between the automatic tax-hike aspect and the automatic spending cuts of the fiscal cliff, and how do you determine their relative importance?\n'ANSWER': The dollar amount associated with tax expirations is larger than the spending cuts, but the impact of both will result in a substantial withdrawal of income from the economy. Congress needs to make tough decisions about the most efficient tax structure and best use of limited resources. The Fed will still be able to conduct open market operations with securities, even if short-term debt is low.", "'QUESTION': Should the rule-writing process for the Volcker rule be slowed down in light of the recent trading loss by J.P. Morgan, or should it proceed expeditiously?\n'ANSWER': The rule-writing process for the Volcker rule has been challenging due to the need for coordination and the large number of comment letters received. While there is no specific release date for the rule, the recent events may provide valuable insights for improving the rule, particularly in terms of requiring banks to provide a plan in advance for hedging, implementing auditing processes, and ensuring appropriate risk management and governance.", "'QUESTION': How much worse will the situation in Europe have to get before it starts seriously denting the prospects for recovery in the American economy, and thus really changing the direction of Fed's policymaking?\n'ANSWER': The situation in Europe has already been a drag on the US recovery, along with other factors. It has affected other countries as well. We hope Europe takes additional measures to stabilize the situation and provide a basis for growth. We are prepared to protect the US economy if things worsen.", "'QUESTION': Is the Fed considering a program similar to the one implemented by the Bank of England, where lending to banks is conditional on lending to households and companies?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is interested in the program and will be following it. However, the details are not yet available and it is important to note that the program in the UK involves a fiscal component. The Fed is constantly looking for new programs to help the economy and this will be considered as well. \n\n'QUESTION': Why are the Fed's projections showing inflation centered below the 2 percent target over the medium term?\n'ANSWER': The Fed's projections show inflation below the target due to various factors. Chairman Bernanke did not provide a detailed explanation. \n\n'QUESTION': What additional actions is the Fed prepared to take and what are the costs and benefits of more quantitative easing (QE) versus more maturity extension?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is prepared to take additional action if necessary, but Chairman Bernanke did not provide specific details on what form that action might take. He mentioned that the costs and benefits of more QE versus more maturity extension would need to be considered.", "'QUESTION': What are the potential costs and benefits of implementing additional quantitative easing (QE) versus more maturity extension?\n'ANSWER': Large asset purchases through QE increase the size of the balance sheet and may have implications for market functioning and financial stability. The costs and risks associated with new measures must be taken into account. However, there is still scope for more action if necessary, primarily focused on the labor market. Maturity extension is unlikely to be pursued further.", "'QUESTION': Is the U.S. economy in a liquidity trap and how can it escape from it?\n'ANSWER': The U.S. economy is in a situation where short-term interest rates are close to zero, limiting the Federal Reserve's ability to add monetary accommodation through rate cuts. However, there are additional steps that can be taken, such as communication techniques and asset purchases, which have been demonstrated to provide financial accommodation and support recovery even when rates are near zero. These nonstandard policies have costs and risks but can be effective in helping the economy.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that Operation Twist could affect banks' earnings and their willingness to lend, and does it undercut your ability to increase credit to consumers?\n'ANSWER': No, lowering interest rates actually makes it more attractive for banks to lend to households and businesses, as they can earn a higher spread between the safe rate and what they can earn by lending. Other barriers to lending may exist, but lower interest rates generally support lending.", "'QUESTION': Are there any countries that the Fed would rule out in buying European sovereign debt?\n'ANSWER': The Fed will not be buying European sovereign debt, except for a small amount that is part of their foreign exchange reserves and primarily comes from a small number of countries. They will not be engaged in such a strategy.", "'QUESTION': Did the addition of two new Fed Governors change the discussion at the FOMC meeting and did they influence the policy direction?\n'ANSWER': The new Governors, Jeremy Stein and Jay Powell, bring valuable experience and expertise to the table. As it was their first meeting, they were mostly in listening mode. However, their presence is welcomed and having a full complement of Governors will enhance the effectiveness of the FOMC's work.", "'QUESTION': Thank you.\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke expresses gratitude for the reporter's comment."]}
