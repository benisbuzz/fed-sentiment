Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.   Thanks for taking our questions.  I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June.  And I also wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March minutes  and, if so , what a recession like what the y\u2019re envisioning would look and feel like when it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , taking your question\u2014of course , today our decision was to raise the federal  funds rate by 25 basis points.  A , a decision on a pause was not made today.  You will have noticed that in the \u2014in the  statement from March, we had a sentence that said the Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.  Tha t sentence is , is not in, in the statement anymore.  We took that out , and instead we \u2019re saying that, in    determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into a ccount certain factors.  So we \u2014that \u2019s a\u2014that\u2019s a meaningful change that we\u2019 re no longer saying that we anticipat e.  And so we \u2019ll be driven by incoming data meeting by meeting.  And, you know, we \u2019ll approach that question at the June meeting.  So the \u2014the staff \u2019s forecast is \u2014so let me say \u2014start by saying that that \u2019s not my own most likely case, which is really that , that the economy will continue to grow at , at a modest rate this year.  And I think that \u2019s\u2014so different people on the Committee have different forecasts.  That \u2019s, that \u2019s my own assessment of the most likely path.  [The] s taff produces its own forecast, and it \u2019s independent of the forecasts of , of the participants, which include the Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course.  And we think this is a healthy thing\u2014that the , the staff is writing down what they really think.  They \u2019re not especially influenced by what the G overnors think, and vice versa.  The Governors are not taking what the staff says and just writing that down.  So it \u2019s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can have different perspectives.  So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, a nd by that I would charact erize as one in which the ris e in unemployment is smaller than is \u2014has been typical in modern- era recessions.  I  wouldn\u2019 t want to characterize the  staff \u2019s forecast for this meeting.  We\u2019ll, we \u2019ll leave that to the minutes \u2014but broadly, broadly similar to tha t\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from  the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions.  I \u2019m wondering if you can talk about the account of possible effects of a debt -limit standoff.  You \u2019ve said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised , but do you see any economic s effects of even getting close to a default?  And what type of situation would that look like?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I wouldn\u2019 t want to speculate specifically, but I will say this:  These are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they \u2019re, they \u2019re for Congress and the Administration \u2014for the elected parts of the government to deal with.  And they\u2019 re really consigned to them.  From our standpoint, I  would just say this:   It\u2019s essential that  the debt ceiling be raised in a timely way , so that the U .S. government can pay all of its bills when they\u2019 re due.  A failure to do that would be unprecedented.  We\u2019d be in uncharted territory, and the \u2014and the  consequences to the U .S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite a[d]verse.  So  I\u2019ll just leave it there.  We , we don\u2019t give advice to either side.  We just would point out that it\u2014that it \u2019s very important that this be done.  And the , the other point I\u2019ll make about that, though, is that no one should assume that the F ed can protect the economy from the potential, you know, short - and long- term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time.  We, we \u2014it\u2019s, it would be so uncertain that it \u2019s just as important  that, that  this\u2014we never get to a place where we\u2019 re actually talking about or even having a situation where the U .S. government \u2019s not paying its bills.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And just a follow -up. Was discussion around the uncertainty of a possible standoff \u2014did that affect today \u2019s monetary policy decision at all?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I wouldn\u2019 t say that it did.  It was \u2014of course, it \u2019s something that came up.  We talk a lot about risks to the \u2014to the  outlook, and that will \u2014that c ome up.  A number of people did raise tha t as a risk to the outlook.  I wouldn\u2019 t say that it was important in today\u2019 s monetary policy decision\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, can you\u2014oh, thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC. Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation    where you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest rate risks?  And can you tell me what supervisory actions you\u2019 ve done in the wake of the recent bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk ?  And kind of part 3 , but it \u2019s all the same question here\u2014do, do you still think this separation principle that mone tary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So the February 14 presentation\u2014I didn\u2019 t remember it very well.  But now, of course, I \u2019ve gone back and looked at it very carefully.  I did remember it.  And  what it was was a general presentation.  It was an informational briefing of the whole B oard\u2014the entire B oard.  I think all members were there.  And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and, and lots of data.  And there was one page on Silicon Val ley Bank, which talked about, you know, the amount of losses they\u2014or mark -to-market losses they had in their portfolio.  There was nothing in it about \u2014that I recall, anyway, about , about  the risk of a bank run.  So it was \u2014I think the takeaway was , they were going away to do a \u2014an assessment, a vertical \u2014sorry, horizontal assessment of , of banks.  It wasn \u2019t\u2014it, it  wasn \u2019t presented as an urgent or alarming situation.  It was presented as a \u2014as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing.  And I thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it.  In terms of what we \u2019re doing\u2014of course, I think banks themselves are , are\u2014many, many banks are now , are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since , since  the events of , of early March, to build liquidity.  And you asked about the separation principle.  I\u2014you know, like so many things, it, it\u2019 s very useful.  But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits.  I mean, I , I think in this particular case , we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict.  They \u2019re both\u2014they \u2019re working well together.  We \u2019ve used our , our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities.  And, at the    same time, we \u2019ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment and price stability.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, I \u2019m sorry.  I don\u2019 t mean to  be argumentative, but the, the staff report said , \u201cSVB  . . . has significant interest rate risk. \u201d  It said, \u201cI nterest rate risk measurement [s] . . . failed \u201d at SVB.  And it said, \u201c Banks with large unrealized losses face significant safety and soundness ri sks.\u201d  Why was that not alarming?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, I mean, I didn\u2019 t say it wasn \u2019t alarming.  It was \u2014they \u2019re pointing out something that they\u2019 re working on and that they\u2019 re on the case\u2014that , that, you know, that \u2014I\u2019m not sure whether they mentioned \u2014I thi nk they did, actually.  They mentioned that they had taken regulatory action matter \u2014or supervisory action in the form of matters requiring attention.  So I think that was also in the presentation.  I think it was to say : Yes, this is a bank , and there are many other banks that are experiencing this \u2014these things, and we \u2019re on the case.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask \u2014obviously, with the recent bank turmoil, we \u2019ve seen multiple banks buy other banks.  And I was just curious whether you think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U .S. getting even larger.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I, you know, we certainly don\u2019 t\u2014and I don\u2019 t have an agenda to further consolidate banks.  There\u2019 s been \u2014consolidation has been a factor in the U .S. banking industry really since interstate banking and before that even\u2014i t goes back more than 30 years.  You\u2014when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks.  Now there    are 4,000 and change.  So that \u2019s, that \u2019s going on.  I personally have long felt that having small -, medium -, and large -size banks is a, a great part of our banking system.  You know, the community banks serve particular customers very wel l; regional banks serve very important purposes , and the various kinds of G -SIBs do as well.  So I think it \u2019s healthy to have a, you know, an arrange\u2014 a range of different kinds of banks doing different things.  I think that \u2019s a positive thing.  Is it a financial \u2014so I would just say, in terms of J .P. Morgan buying First Republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely.  That, that  is their ro le, so I really don\u2019 t have a comment on , on that process.  As you know, there\u2019 s an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank.  So it was legitimate.  And I think the FDIC , I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least -cost bi d.  So I w ould assume that\u2019s what they did.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: S o do you have any concerns about the fact that they\u2019 re, they\u2019 re getting larger in general \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I , I think it \u2019s probably good policy that we , we don\u2019 t want the largest banks doing big acquisi tions.  That is the policy.  And \u2014but this is \u2014this is an exception for a failing bank.  And I , I think it \u2019s actually a good outcome for the banking system.  It also would have \u2014would have been a good\u2014a good outcome for the banking system had one of the regional banks bought , bought  this company.  And that could have been the outcome.  But , ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is , it goes to the , the least -cost bid\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Just to quickly follow up\u2014what does it suggest about the scope for the Committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains strong then, if , if it\u2019s having some kind of substitute effect?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  It\u2019s that \u2014this is just something that we have to factor in as we \u2014as we want to find ourselves.  So I guess I would say it this way:  The assessment of , of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one , meeting by meeting, and we \u2019re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that \u2014they \u2019re listed in , in    the statement, the obvious factors.  That \u2019s, that \u2019s the way we\u2019 re going to be thinking about it.  And that \u2019s really all we can do.  As I say, it does complicate \u2014we, we have, you know, a broad understanding of monetary policy.  Credit tightening is a different thing.  There\u2019 s a lot of literature on that.  But translating it into , into  rate hikes is uncertain , let\u2019s say \u2014it adds even further uncertainty.  Nonetheless, we\u2019 ll be able to see what \u2019s happening with credit conditions \u2014what \u2019s happening with lending. We get \u2014there\u2019 s a lot of data on that.  And, you know, we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll factor that into our decisionmaking\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Thank you.  So, noting that the statement dropped the reference to \u201c sufficiently \u201d restricted \u2014\u201crestrictive, \u201d I was wondering, given your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5\u00bc percent is, in fact, sufficiently restrictive.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: hat \u2019s going to be an ongoing assessment.  We \u2019re going to need data to accumulate on that \u2014not an assessment that we\u2019 ve made, as \u2014that , that  would mean we think we\u2019ve reached that point.  And I just think it \u2019s, it\u2019s not possible to say that with confidence now.  But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the S ummary of E conomic P rojections from the March meeting showed that in\u2014at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was \u2014this was the appropriate level of the \u2014of the  ultimate high  level of rates.  We don \u2019t know that. We\u2019ll revisit that at the June meeting.  And that \u2019s\u2014you know, we \u2019re just going to have to\u2014before we real ly declare that, I think we \u2019re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you know, make that \u2014as I mentioned, it \u2019s an ongoing assessment\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: I have a follow -up on credit.  Could you give us a sense of what the SLOOS survey indicated?  It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were    tightening credit as of the, the last survey.  What did this one show, and how did that weigh into your deliberations?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So  we\u2019re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in li ne with our usual time  frame.  And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent , when you see it , with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we \u2019re seeing from other sources.  You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls that indicate that midsize banks have \u2014some of them had been tightening their lending standards.  Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, the argument around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves.  After the bank failures in March, as you\u2019ve discussed, the Fed staff p rojected a recession starting later this year.  So my question is why it was necessary to raise interest rates today .  Or, put , put differently :  If the whole point of slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you\u2019 ve, for the last  two meetings , been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to keep moving?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: ell, we\u2014the reason is that we \u2014again, with our monetary policy we\u2019re try \u2014trying to reach and then\u2014and then stay at a , for an extended period, a level of policy\u2014a policy stance that \u2019s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.  And, you know, that \u2019s what we \u2019re trying to do with our \u2014with our tool.  I think slowing down was the right move.  I , I think it \u2019s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do    so.  So I , I\u2014you know, we really\u2014you know, we have to balance.  We always have to balance the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of maybe slowing down economic activity too much.  And we thought that this rate hike, along with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to Howard \u2019s question\u2014you\u2019 ll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently restrictive stance.  Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period than a six -week intermeeting cycle?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yeah.  I mean, as  I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment will be an ongoing one.  You\u2014you know, you can\u2019 t\u2014with , with  economic data, you, you can\u2019t\u2014you\u2019 ve, you\u2019 ve seen \u2014take inflation for a minute.   Look, look back.  We\u2019 ve seen inflation come down\u2014move back up two or three times since March of 2021.  We\u2019ve seen inflation have a few months of coming down and then come right back up.  So I think you\u2019 re going to want to see that \u2014you know, that a few months of data will , will persuade you that you\u2019 ve\u2014that you\u2019 ve got this right , kind of thing.  And, you know, we , we have the luxury:  W e\u2019ve raised 500 basis points.  I think that policy is tight.  I think real rates are probably \u2014that you can calculate them  many different ways.  But one way is to look at the  nominal rate and then subtract a , a reasonable estimate of , of, let\u2019s say , one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent.  So you\u2019 ve got 2 percent real rates.  That \u2019s meaningfully above what most people would\u2014many people, anyway, would, would assess as, yo u know, the neutral rate.  So  policy is tight.  And you see that in interest \u2014interest -sensitive activities.  And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities.  And if you\u2014if you put the \u2014you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that \u2019s, that \u2019s    ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we \u2019re, we may not be far off \u2014we\u2019re possibly even at \u2014that level.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you very much, Chair Powell.  Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.  So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections show , at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of 3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent  target?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Look \u2014I think we \u2019re always going to have 2 percent as our , our target .

We\u2019re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time.  I mean, we \u2014that \u2019s, that \u2019s not a question that \u2019s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things.  But , ultimately, we\u2019re not looking to get  to 3 percent and then drop our tools.  We have a, a  goal of getting to 2 percent.  We think it \u2019s going to take some time.  We don \u2019t think it\u2019 ll be a smooth process.

Right now , you have a labor market that \u2019s still extraordinarily tight.   You still got 1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number , for every unemployed person.  We do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions.  But, overall, you\u2019 re near a 50-year low in unemployment.  Wages \u2014you all will have seen that the wage number from late    last week, and it \u2019s\u2014whenever it was.  And, you know, it \u2019s, it\u2019s a couple  of percentage points above what would be \u2014what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.  So  we do see some softening ; we see new labor supply coming in.  These are very positive developments.  But the labor market  is very, very strong, where as inflation is, you know, running high\u2014well above our \u2014well above our goal.  And right now , we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down.  Fortunately, we \u2019ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Matt.  MATTHEW BO ESLER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.  So, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed officials \u2019 projections did imply or seem ed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast as well, given the strong first -quarter GDP tracking estimates.  And so I \u2019m just wondering if you could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you\u2019 re optimistic that a recession can be avoided, given that that \u2019s the F ed staff \u2019s forecast \u2014possibly also the broader Committee \u2019s forecast as well\u2014and , and also, of course, most private -sector forecasters \u2019\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yeah .  I don \u2019t think \u2014you know, I know what \u2019s printed in the Summary of E conomic P rojections and all that.  I don\u2019 t think you can deduce exactly what you said about what participants think, because you don\u2019 t know what they were thinking for first -quarter GDP at that point.  They could have been thinking about a fairly low number.  Anyway, in any case, I \u2019ll just say , I, I continue to think that it \u2019s possible that this time is really different.  And the reason is , there \u2019s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s interesting , as, you know, we \u2019ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the unemployment rate is 3\u00bd percent,  pretty much where it was \u2014even lower than where it was when we started.  So job openings are still very, very high.  We see\u2014by surveys and much,    much [other] evidence \u2014that, that  conditions are cooling gradually.  But it\u2019 s\u2014it really is different.  You know, it wasn\u2019 t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of the\u2014as they \u2019ve declined without unemployment going up.  Well, that \u2019s what we \u2019ve seen.  So we\u2014there are no promises in this.  But it just seems that, to me , that it\u2019 s possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes.  Now, that would be a gainst history.  I , I fully appreciate that.  That would be against the , the pattern.  But I do think that it \u2014that this, that the situation in the labor market , with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are actually \u2014wages have been moving down.  Wag e increases have been moving down, and that \u2019s a good sign\u2014down to a more sustainable level.  So I think that \u2014I think it \u2019s still possible.  I \u2014you know, I think, you know, the , the case of , of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than that of having, having a recession.  But it\u2019 s not \u2014it\u2019 s not that the case of having a recession is\u2014I don\u2019 t rule that out, either.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.  Do you see that as well?  And could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: ure.  So we look at a range of wage , wage  measures.  And then that\u2019s in nominal.  And then\u2014so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases plus inflation.  And so you ca n\u2014you can look at, you know, the employment compensation index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta w age t racker, compensation per hour \u2014basically , those four and many others.  And you can\u2014you can look at , at what the \u2014what they would have to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.  They can    deviate.  You know, corporate margins can go up and down.  And there is a feature of long expansions where they do go down\u2014where labor gets a bigger share toward later , later in a recession \u2014sorry, later in an expansion.  So, yeah.  The, the\u2014you know, and we calculate those, and you have to take the precision with a degree of \u2014a degree of salt.  But I would say that what they will show is that, you know, if , if the\u2014if wages  are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer to where they need to be.  Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take to get \u2014to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time.  I\u2014by the way, I don\u2019 t want to\u2014I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation.  You \u2019re asking me a very specific question.  I think there are many things.  I think wages and prices tend to move together.  And it \u2019s very hard to say what \u2019s causing what.  But, you know, I \u2019ve never said that, you know, that\u2014that wages are really the principal driver , because I don \u2019t think that \u2019s really right.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Great.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  Well, you mentioned profit margins.  Those have expanded\u2014did expand sharply during this inflationary period.  And while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven\u2019 t fallen as much as might be expected, given that we \u2019re seeing at least some pullback among consumer spending.  So , speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a driver of higher prices?  And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to reduced inflation in the coming months?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So higher profits and higher m argins are what happens when you have an imbalance between supply and demand:  too much demand, not enough supply.  And we\u2019ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where , where supply has been fixed or , or not flexible enough.  And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices.  So to get, I , I think\u2014as goods pipelines have , have  gotten, you know, back to normal so that we    don\u2019t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing\u2014I think you will see inflation come dow n.  And you\u2019 ll see \u2014you\u2019 ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of full competition , where there\u2019 s enough supply to meet demand.  And then it \u2019s\u2014then it \u2019s, then you\u2019re really back to full competition.

So, what are we looking at?  I mean, we look at a combination of data and , and forecasts.  Of course, the whole idea is to\u2014is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data.  So we \u2019re always, always looking at both.  You know, and it will \u2014of course , it\u2019ll be the obvious things.  It \u2019ll be readings on infla tion.  It \u2019ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of those many things.  I think a particular focus for us going\u2014now , over the past six, seven weeks now and going forward is going to be , what \u2019s happening with credit tighte ning?  A re small and medium -sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on lending?   And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy.  That\u2019ll, that \u2019ll be an important thing.  I just \u2014you know, we \u2019ll be looking at everything.  It\u2019s\u2014   again, I would just point out , we\u2019ve raised rates by 5 percentage points.  We are shrinking the balance sheet.   And now we have credit conditions tightening\u2014not just in the normal way, but perhaps a little bit more , due to what \u2019s happened.  And we have to factor all of that in and, and make our assessment of \u2014you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive.   And we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable l ags.  So this is challenging.  But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that \u2019s what we think.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  What about the idea of rate cuts\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yeah.  So we  on the Committee have a \u2014have a view that inflation is going to come down\u2014not so quickly, but it \u2019ll take some time.   And in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and \u2014to cut rates, and we won\u2019 t cut rates.  If you have a different forecast and, you know, markets \u2014or have been, from time to time , pricing in, you know, quite rapid reducti ons in inflation, you know, we \u2019d, we \u2019d factor that in.  But that \u2019s not our forecast.  And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down.  Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn \u2019t moved much.  And it \u2019s quite stable.  And, you know, so we think we \u2019ll have to \u2014demand will have to weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions , conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there.

I \u2019m curious how you view the role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress .  Do you think it \u2019s contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to    compete with banks for deposits?  And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of the facility?   Or do you see that being put on the table in the future?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Sure.  So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine. And, you know, the \u2014it\u2019 s, it\u2019s really not contributing, we don\u2019 t think, now.  It hasn \u2019t actually been growing.  You know, it moved up\u2014moved down and then moved back up to where it was.  What happened in the \u2014when , when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have really stabilized now \u2014what happened was , institutional investors took their uninsured deposits and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home Loan Banks and things like that.  Over the course of , of maybe the last year, retail investors had been gradual \u2014as they do in every tightening cycle, they\u2019 ve been gradually moving their deposits into higher -yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds.  So that \u2019s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a , a tightening cycle.  What was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around and things like that.  But it doesn\u2019 t seem to have had any \u2014any effect overall on the  over night repo facility.

Some of that is \u2014may,  it may just have been technology evolving.  You know, we have to keep up with all  that.

I also think we are very focused on what \u2019s happening with credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the \u2014in the  Beige Book, and you will see in the SLOOS , is, is small and medium\u2014medium -sized, small and medium -sized banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards \u2014build liquidity.

Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I just wondered i f you \u2019ve done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up to it over the last\u2014since you\u2019 ve been Fed Chairman, I think I \u2019ve heard you say a couple of times that you defer red to the Vice C hair for S upervision.  Do you think that was the right way to go about this?  And , yeah, comments on that.  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So let me say, first of all, I \u2019ve been Chair of the Board for five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes.  I think w e\u2019ve learned some    new things as well, and we need to do better.  And , as I mentioned, I thought the report was unflinching and appropriately so.  I welcome it.   And I agree with and will support those recommendations.  And I do feel that I \u2019m personally accountable to do what I can to foster measures that will address the problems.  So, on, on the V ice C hair for S upervision, you know, the place to start is , is the statutory role, which is quite unusual.  The Vice Chair, it says, shall deploy policy recommendations \u2014\u201cdevelop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution . . . companies  . . . , and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms.\u201d   So this is Congress establishing a four -year term for someone else on the Board\u2014not , not the C hair\u2014as V ice C hair for Supervision who really gets to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors.  Congress wanted that person to be \u2014to have political accountability for developing that agenda.  So the way it works \u2014the way it has worked in practice f or me is , I\u2019ve had a good working relationship.  I give my, my counsel, my input privately, and that \u2019s\u2014I offer that.  And I have good conversations, and I try to contribute constructively.  I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that person, including working with, with  Vice Chair Barr and , and his predecessor.  And I think that\u2019s the way it \u2019s supposed to work, and that \u2019s appropriate.  I, I believe that \u2019s what the law requires.  And, you know \u2014but , but it isn \u2019t\u2014I wouldn\u2019 t say it\u2019 s a matter of complete deference.  It\u2019s more , I have a \u2014I have a role in , in presenting my views and discussing\u2014having an intelligent discussion about what \u2019s going on and why.

They are committed to learning from this episode and preventing similar events in the future, as evidenced by the release of a review on supervision and regulation. Monetary policy remains focused on promoting employment and stable prices, with a commitment to bringing inflation back down to the 2 percent goal.The FOMC raised its policy interest rate by \u00c2\u00bc percentage point in order to achieve price stability and strong labor market conditions. Despite a modest pace of economic growth, the U.S. economy slowed significantly last year.Activity in the housing sector is weak due to higher mortgage rates, while higher interest rates and slower output growth are impacting business fixed investment. The labor market remains tight, with strong job gains and a low unemployment rate, but there are signs of better balance between supply and demand. However, nominal wage growth has eased and job vacancies have declined, and inflation remains above the target.Inflation has remained high, with total PCE prices rising 4.2 percent over the past year and core PCE prices rising 4.6 percent. Despite this, longer-term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored. The Fed is committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective, but acknowledges the hardship high inflation imposes on individuals. At the latest meeting, the Committee raised the federal funds rate by \u00c2\u00bc percentage point, bringing it to 5 to 5\u00c2\u00bc percent, and continues to reduce its securities holdings.The effects of policy tightening are being seen in interest rate-sensitive sectors like housing and investment, but it will take time for the full impact to be realized, especially on inflation. The economy is likely to face further challenges from tighter credit conditions, which have already been tightening due to previous policy actions and a softer economic outlook. These tighter credit conditions are expected to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, but the extent of these effects remains uncertain. Future policy actions will depend on how events unfold, and the Committee will consider the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags in its effects, and economic and financial developments in determining the appropriate level of policy firming to return inflation to 2 percent. This determination will be made meeting by meeting based on incoming data and their implications for the economic outlook.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is prepared to take further action if necessary to maintain monetary policy restraint. They are committed to reducing inflation and keeping longer-term inflation expectations stable, even if it requires below-trend growth and softening labor market conditions.

Has the Fed staff revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March minutes, and if so, what would this recession look like in terms of the unemployment rate?\n\n'ANSWER': Today's decision was to raise the federal funds rate, and a decision on a pause was not made. The statement no longer anticipates additional policy firming and instead considers certain factors in determining future policy. The staff's forecast for a mild recession is one where the rise in unemployment is smaller than in typical recessions.", "'QUESTION': Can you discuss the possible effects of a debt-limit standoff and what a default situation would look like?\n'ANSWER': It is the responsibility of Congress and the Administration to handle fiscal policy matters.

It is important to avoid a situation where the government is not paying its bills.", "'QUESTION': Did the uncertainty of a possible standoff affect today's monetary policy decision?\n'ANSWER': The uncertainty of a possible standoff was discussed but it did not have a significant impact on today's monetary policy decision. It was raised as a risk to the outlook by some members, but it was not deemed important in the decision-making process.", "'QUESTION': Can you tell us what actions the Federal Reserve Board took in response to the interest rate risks faced by Silicon Valley Bank and other banks, and what supervisory actions have been taken after recent bank failures to ensure appropriate management of interest rate risk? Do you still believe in the separation principle between monetary policy and supervision?\n'ANSWER': The February presentation was an informational briefing on interest rate risk, not an urgent situation. Banks are now focusing on liquidity and building it since early March. The separation principle is useful but has its limits. Monetary policy and financial stability tools are not in conflict and have been used together to support banks and foster employment and price stability.", "'QUESTION': Why was the significant interest rate risk and failed interest rate risk measurement at SVB not alarming?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell acknowledged the concerns raised by the staff report, stating that they are aware of the issue and taking regulatory action. He emphasized that SVB is not the only bank facing these challenges and reassured that they are actively addressing the situation.", "'QUESTION': What is Chair Powell's opinion on further consolidation in the banking sector and the potential increase in size of the largest bank in the U.S.?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell does not have an agenda to further consolidate banks and believes that having small, medium, and large banks is important for the banking system. He sees it as healthy to have a range of different kinds of banks serving different purposes. He does not comment on specific bank acquisitions, as the FDIC is responsible for the process and is bound by law to accept the least-cost bid.", "'QUESTION': Do you have any concerns about the fact that the largest banks are getting larger in general?\n'ANSWER': It is good policy to prevent the largest banks from making big acquisitions. However, in the case of a failing bank, it is an exception. It would have been a positive outcome for the banking system if a regional bank had acquired the failing bank. Ultimately, we have to follow the law, which prioritizes the least-cost bid.", "QUESTION: What does it suggest about the scope for the Committee to pause rate increases next month, even if the data remains strong, if it's having some kind of substitute effect?\n\nANSWER: The assessment of whether additional rate hikes are appropriate will be ongoing and evaluated meeting by meeting. The factors mentioned in the statement will be considered, including credit conditions and lending data, although translating the impact of credit tightening into rate hikes adds uncertainty.", "'QUESTION': Do you believe the current interest rate is sufficiently restrictive?\n'ANSWER': We cannot say with confidence whether the current rate is sufficiently restrictive. We will need to accumulate data and reassess at the June meeting before making a determination. The March meeting showed that the median participant believed this rate was appropriate, but we will continue to assess based on ongoing data.", "'QUESTION': Could you give us a sense of what the SLOOS survey indicated and how it weighed into your deliberations?\n'ANSWER': The results of the SLOOS survey will be released on May 8. It is broadly consistent with our understanding of the situation and what we are seeing from other sources. Midsize banks have been tightening lending standards, and while lending has continued to grow, the pace has been slowing since the second half of last year.", "'QUESTION': Why was it necessary to raise interest rates today if the whole point of slowing down the pace was to see the effects of previous moves?\n'ANSWER': The goal of the Federal Reserve is to reach and maintain a sufficiently restrictive policy stance to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. Slowing down the pace of rate increases allowed us to gather more data, but we must balance the risk of not doing enough to control inflation with the risk of slowing down economic activity too much. We believe this rate hike, along with changes in our policy statement, strikes the right balance.", "'QUESTION': Does the data need to accumulate over a longer period than a six-week intermeeting cycle to determine if the stance is sufficiently restrictive?\n'ANSWER': The assessment of data will be ongoing. Inflation has fluctuated multiple times since March 2021, so a few months of data would be needed to confirm if the stance is correct. With a 500 basis point increase and real rates above the neutral rate, policy is tight and evident in interest-sensitive activities. Credit tightening and ongoing QT further contribute to the restrictive stance.", "'QUESTION': Would it be acceptable for the Federal Reserve to tolerate a prolonged period of 3 percent inflation and hope for an outside event to bring it back down to the 2 percent target?\n\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve's target is always 2 percent inflation, and they will continue to focus on reaching that target.", "'QUESTION': Would the FOMC be okay with a prolonged 3 percent inflation rate?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC is not looking for a prolonged 3 percent inflation rate. Their goal is to achieve a 2 percent inflation rate over time and they do not plan to stop their efforts once they reach 3 percent. They anticipate that reaching their goal will take time and may not be a smooth process, so they expect to continue their efforts for a while.", "'QUESTION': How does the other side of the mandate \u00e2\u0080\u0094the jobs side \u00e2\u0080\u0094once you get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance?\n'ANSWER': Both the jobs side and inflation side of the mandate will matter equally when the unemployment rate reaches 3 percent. Currently, the labor market is tight with a low unemployment rate and high wages, while inflation is above our goal. Our focus now is on bringing inflation down without increasing unemployment.", "'QUESTION': Why are you optimistic that a recession can be avoided?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell believes that the current situation is different because there is excess demand in the labor market despite raising rates, and job openings have declined without an increase in unemployment. While it goes against historical patterns, he thinks it's possible to have a cooling labor market without a recession, although he doesn't rule it out completely.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree that wage growth is still above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation, and can you explain how you come to that judgment?\n'ANSWER': We analyze various wage measures and compare them to productivity increases and inflation. While there may be deviations and factors like corporate margins and labor share, wage increases closer to 3 percent would be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time. However, I don't believe wages are the main driver of inflation.", "'QUESTION': Do you see expanded profit margins as a driver of higher prices? And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and contribute to reduced inflation in the coming months?\n'ANSWER': Higher profits and margins occur when there is an imbalance between supply and demand. As supply becomes more flexible and returns to normal, inflation will decrease and corporate margins will also decrease due to increased competition. This will lead to a return to full competition and a reduction in inflation.", "'QUESTION': Can you tell us something about what your policy reaction function is \u00e2\u0080\u0094your policy framework is going forward? When you look at the economy at the next meeting, are you looking at incoming data, which is, by definition, backward looking? Are you going to be forecasting what you think is going to happen? Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in?\n'ANSWER': I didn't catch the last part. Rolling", "'QUESTION': Do you rule out rate cuts by the end of the year, given that markets have priced them in?\n'ANSWER': We consider a combination of data and forecasts to create a good forecast. We focus on inflation, wages, economic growth, the labor market, and credit tightening. We have raised rates by 5 percentage points, shrunk the balance sheet, and credit conditions are tightening. We need to assess if our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive.", "'QUESTION': What is the Federal Open Market Committee's view on rate cuts?\n'ANSWER': The Committee believes that inflation will decrease gradually over time. If this forecast is accurate, rate cuts would not be appropriate. However, if there is a different forecast or market expectations of rapid inflation reduction, it would be taken into consideration. The history of the past two years shows a decline in inflation, particularly in nonhousing services. In order to see progress, there may need to be a slight weakening in demand and labor market conditions, but in the current circumstances, rate cuts would not be appropriate.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve view the role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the current banking stress and is it contributing to the competition between money market funds and banks for deposits?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve does not believe that the overnight reverse repo facility is contributing to the banking stress. The facility has not been growing and the recent deposit flows were mainly due to institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits into government money market funds. The facility is designed to help maintain interest rates and is serving its purpose effectively.", "'QUESTION': What would be the impact of a default on the debt ceiling for Americans, the markets, and borrowing?\n'ANSWER': The Chair of the FOMC believes that the U.S. should not even be discussing the possibility of not paying its bills. He emphasizes that the Fed cannot fully protect the economy, financial system, and global reputation from the damage that a default would cause.", "'QUESTION': Do you share the view that the regulatory lapse at Silicon Valley Bank was due to a policy change and a cultural shift towards less aggressive oversight? What would it take to achieve stronger oversight?\n'ANSWER': I find the report persuasive. A large bank failed unexpectedly, and we need to understand what went wrong and address it. It could be a result of evolving technology or our policies. Our focus now is to identify and implement necessary changes to prevent such failures in the future.", "'QUESTION': Are we in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks? Do you still have a bias to tighten rates?\n'ANSWER': The three large banks that were at the heart of the stress in early March have been resolved and depositors protected. The sale of First Republic is an important step towards ending that period of severe stress. We are closely monitoring credit availability and the macroeconomic effects of tightening credit standards by small and medium-sized banks. We will factor this assessment into our decisions going forward.", "QUESTION: Have you reflected on your actions during the crisis and do you think deferring to the Vice Chair for Supervision was the right approach?\n\nANSWER: I recognize that mistakes were made and we need to do better. I welcome the unflinching report and support its recommendations. The Vice Chair for Supervision has the statutory role of setting the agenda for supervision and regulation, and I offer my input privately while respecting their authority. Ultimately, they have sole authority over supervision.", "'QUESTION': Just wondered if you have any regrets? Or was there anything that, you know \u00e2\u0080\u0094decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened?\n'ANSWER': I've had a few, sure. You don't get to look back and think about what could have been done differently. My focus is on controlling what we can control, making a fair assessment, learning the right lessons, implementing fixes, and following through on Vice Chair Barr's report.", "'QUESTION': Did the possibility of pausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered? Were there any initial concerns about raising rates again or what were the discussions about?\n\n'ANSWER': Support for the rate increase was strong, but some discussions about pausing did occur. However, the sense is that we are closer to the end of tightening than the beginning. Ongoing assessment will be made based on listed factors to determine if further action is needed.", "'QUESTION': Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report or inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell couldn't say for certain, but he believes that the Federal Reserve has made significant progress and can now afford to carefully assess the data before making any decisions on raising rates.", "'QUESTION': What are the lessons learned from the banking crisis?\n'ANSWER': The run on Silicon Valley Bank showed that runs can happen much more quickly than previously thought, which should be reflected in regulation and supervision. Vice Chair Barr will lead the efforts to address this. It is clear that both supervision and regulations for banks of this size need to be strengthened, and progress is being made in that direction.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide more details on stress testing and examining banks with specific concentrations in certain sectors?\n'ANSWER': Vice Chair Barr is responsible for overseeing stress testing and analyzing banks with specific sector exposures."]}
