Thanks for doing this.  I guess , since I \u2019m first, I\u2019ll go ahead and re -up Howard \u2019s question from the last press conference :  Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet?  Have you and your colleagues had any conversations to this effect?   Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thank you.  So, no, i t is not time yet.  We \u2019ve said that we would let the public know when it is time to have that conversation, and we said we \u2019d do that well in advance of any actual decision to taper our asset purchases, and we will do so.  In the meantime, we\u2019ll be monitoring progr ess toward our goals.  We first articulated this \u201csubstantial further progress \u201d test at our December meeting.  Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked up after slowing over the winter.   And it will take some time before we see substantial fu rther progress.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Okay.  Hi.  Thank you so much.  My question is about what \u2019s going on with the virus , and what if we don\u2019 t reach a level of herd immunity, per se .  So, in your scenario , thinking about the outlook and the economy, do you have some model where you might start to still normalize policy even if there \u2019s like a baseline of infection still going on?  Or how can you, you know, talk about how you\u2019 re weighing those things?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s, so w e have to leave questions about herd immunity and what that looks like to the health experts, but , but I would certainly say that what matters the most to the economic recovery continues to be controlling the virus.  The economy can\u2019 t fully recover until people are confident that it \u2019s safe to resume activities involving crowds of people.  There may be people who are around the edges of the labor force who won\u2019 t come back in unless they feel really comfortable going bac k to their old jobs, for example, and there, there may be parts of the economy that will \u2014that just won \u2019t be able to , to really fully reengage until the pandemic is decisively behind us.  But, you know, we \u2019ve articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and for lifting off and raising interest rates.   So for , for asset purchases, we\u2019 ve said that we w ould continue at the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward our goals.  So \u2014and that is , that is  what  it is, substantial further progress.  For interest rates, as I\u2014as I  said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment , we want to see inflation at 2  percent , and we want to see it on track to exceed 2 percent .  So those are our tests.  We don\u2019 t have an independent test to do with the virus.  I will say, though, as I \u2014as I  started with, you know, the , the path of the virus is going to have an effect on our ability to achieve both of those tests.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that test for raising interest rates that you just elaborated.  You \u2019ve obviously made it very clear that you want to see improvements in the real economy and the real data and not in just sort of expectations data before making that move .  But I guess I wonder what happens if inflation expectations were to move up before you see some sort of return to full employmen t.  You know, it seems like a lot of sort of the stability in inflation has been tied to the fact that those have been so low and stable, and I guess I wonder how , how  your reaction would be\u2014sort of how your reaction to that is , is\u2014how you\u2019 re thinking about that.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Right.  So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation moving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market.   I won \u2019t say that it \u2019s impossible, but it , it seems\u2014 it seems unlikely.  It \u2019s much more likely that we would \u2014having achieved maximum -employment conditions \u2014we \u2019d also be seeing 2  percent  inflation and be on track to see inflation moving above 2 percent .  They tend to move together.  So that \u2019s not to say inflation won\u2019 t\u2014might not move up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that , that  really starts to move inflation expectations up, that would have to \u2014that would take some time .  And you would think that , that  it would be quite likely that , that  we\u2019d be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening.  If it\u2014if that actually were to happen, though, there is a \u2014there\u2019s a  paragraph in the \u2014in the Statement on L onger -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy which says that when the two goals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the , the time it would take to get back and [so] forth.  So we do \u2014it doesn\u2019 t really tell you what to do, but it tells you that we will weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to reach them were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely  state.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, I want to follow up on Jonnelle \u2019s question, and I wonder if you can help us understand better your thinking about how COVID infection rates and the virus calibrate with monetary policy.  As you recall, we had a major resurgence in the virus last fall .  And I\u2019m wondering, would you need to be assured that there wasn \u2019t such a resurgence coming before you began\u2014I mean, for lack of a better term \u2014thinking about thinking about tapering?   And what kind of comfort level would you need?  Would it be something that would be declared from the CDC or the , or the  World Health Organization \u2014for example, downgrading the virus from a pandemic \u2014before you have the comfort level to reverse course on policy?   Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  W e, we really have \u2014just articulated the goals that I\u2019ve \u2014that I\u2019ve just mentioned a  couple of times , which is substantial further progress toward our goals before we taper.  Now, that \u2019s very likely\u2014for us to achieve that, it \u2019s very likely going to be the case that we \u2019ve also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination and, and other \u2014it, it\u2014y ou know, those two things should more or less coexist.  We haven \u2019t articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we \u2019d like to achieve because we\u2019 re not \u2014you know, we \u2019re not experts in that area.  We\u2019 re, we\u2019re  really focused on the economic outcomes, and, again, my , my guess is that we\u2014 it\u2019s very likely, it seems to me, that for us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates.  W e would also have to have made very substanti al progress in getting the virus under control \u2014not , not necessarily fully under control.  There is a, a  possibility, of course, that we will , will have ongoing outbreaks over the summer and various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter    as well.   But we \u2019ll be looking for substantial progress toward our goal \u2014substantial further progress toward our goals as we think about tapering asset purchases.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.   I wanted to ask, you \u2019ve talked a lot during this crisis about the need to have a lot of help from fiscal policy and monetary policy to make sure that there \u2019s not long- term scar ring in the economy .  And I was just wondering, you know, given all of the policies that have been put in place, do you expect there to still be some long- term scarring?  A nd, if so, you know, what are you most worried about?  Where are you most worried about that showing up?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I would say that we were very worried about scar ring, both in the labor market from people being out of \u2014out of  the labor market for an extended period of time.  The evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult if you \u2019re out for a long time to get back in and get back to the life that you had.  Same thing with these small businesses, many of which are the work of generations.  Were we going to wipe out many of those unnecessarily?  That was a big concern.  I would say that , so far, you know, here we are in late April of 2021.  We haven \u2019t experienced that level of scar ring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses.  So we\u2019re not living that, that  downside case that we were very concerned about a year ago.  Notwithstanding that, we \u2019re a long way from full employment.   We\u2019 re\u2014you know, payroll jobs are 8.4 million below where they were in February of 2020.  We\u2019ve got a long ways to go.  A nd also, it \u2019s going to be a different economy.    So we \u2019ve been hearing a lot from companies that they are \u2014they \u2019ve been looking at deploying better technology and perhaps fewer people, including in some of the service industries that have been employing a lot of people.  You know, it , it may well be \u2014it seems quite likely that a number of the people who, who had those service -sector jobs will struggle to find the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had.  These were people who were working in February of 2020.  They clearly want to work.  So those people are going to need \u2014they\u2019 re going to need help.  And so, while I would say we haven \u2019t seen really highly elevated levels of unemployment for \u2014you know, up in the teens that we thought we  might have for an extended period of time, we \u2019ve still got a lot of people who are out to \u2014out of work.  We want to get them back to work as quickly as possible, and that \u2019s really one of the things we \u2019re trying to achieve with our policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell , for taking our questions.  The housing market in many American cities is seeing booming prices, bidding wars, and all -cash offers well above asking price.  A nd this is happening at the same time that housing is becoming much more expensive for lower -income Americans and people who are still struggling from the pandemic.  Do you have concerns that there are localized housing bubbles  or that there \u2019s the potential f or that, and what is the Fed  doing to monitor or address this?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course .  And I would say that , before the pandemic, it \u2019s a very different housing market than it was before the Global F inancial C risis.  And one of the main differences was that households were in very good    shape financially compared to where they were.   In addition, most people who got mortgages were people with pretty high credit scores.  There wasn \u2019t the subprime \u2014you know, low -doc, no-doc lending practices were not there.  So we don\u2019 t have that kind of thing where we have a housing bubble where people are overlevered and owning a lot of houses.  There \u2019s no q uestion, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we \u2019re watching that carefully.   It\u2019s, it\u2019s partly because there\u2019 s, there\u2019s  clearly strong demand, and there \u2019s just not a lot of supply right now.  So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up wi th the demand, clearly.  Inventories are tremendously low.  We\u2019re, we\u2019re  all hearing those stories.  A nd if you\u2019 re\u2014if you\u2019re an entry level housing buyer, this is \u2014this is  a problem , because it just is going to be that much harder for people to get that first house , and that \u2019s a problem.  I mean, we \u2014it\u2019 s part of a strong economy, with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing.  So, in that sense, it \u2019s good.  It \u2019s clearly the strongest housing market that we \u2019ve seen since the G lobal Financial C risis.  And, you know, my hope would be that , over time, housing builders can react to this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry.  So, you know, it is \u2014it\u2019s  not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and we\u2019re watching it very carefully.  I don \u2019t see the kind of financial stability current concerns, though, that really do reside around the housing sector.  So ma ny of the financial crackups in all countries, all western countries, that have happened in the last 30 years have been around housing.  We don\u2019 t\u2014we really don\u2019 t see that here.  We don\u2019 t see bad loans and unsustainable prices and that kind of thing. MICHEL LE SMITH.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to ask about the labor market.  Do you\u2014do you see things,  such as in the Beige Book\u2014you saw in the Beige Book anecdotes about businesses not able to find workers , [inaudible] back to the labor market for fear of getting sick, childcare concerns, and so forth.  Do you see these as also just sort of temporary bottlenecks that won\u2019 t have much effect on the long- term health of the la bor market?  Or how are you thinking about these kinds of issues?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Chris , you were breaking up a little there, but I think I did get your question.  So I think there are a number  of\u2014a number  of things going on there :  the tension between a hi gh level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can\u2019 t find \u2014an elevated number of companies saying that they can\u2019 t find workers.  So, what \u2019s really going on there?  It, it should be a number of different things.  There are workers who don\u2019 t actually have the specific skills that the employers are looking for.  There may be geographical differences.   It, it may also be that, for example, there \u2014one big factor would be , schools aren \u2019t open yet, so there  are still people who are at home taking c are of their children and would like to be back in the workforce but can \u2019t be yet.  There are people afraid of \u2014there are virus fears that are weighing on people , so some \u2014some people don\u2019 t want to go back to work.  There are also a significant number of peo ple who say they\u2019 ve retired \u2014a large number of people that say that they\u2019 re retired.  Now, it \u2019s hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market strengthens and as COVID, you know, becomes a\u2014in the rearview mirror, in the history books, if you will.  So\u2014but clearly there \u2019s something going, going on out there, as , as many companies are reporting labor shortages.  We don\u2019 t see wages moving up yet, and presumably we would see    that in a real \u2014you know, in a really tight labor market.  And we may well start to see that.  I do think\u2014so what will happen\u2014what we saw during the last expansion, an d it may  be a different expansion, we don\u2019 t know, but , but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up.  In other words, if you were worried about there \u2014about running out of workers, it seemed like we never did.  You know, labor force participati on held up.  People came in the labor force.  They stayed in the labor force longer than expected.  So my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force, and these jobs will be \u2014the labor market will reach equilibrium.  Maybe pay wi ll go up.  B ut I do think that \u2014and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that \u2019s a factor, which is not clear , it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.  So my guess is, it will come back to this e conomy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand.  It may take some months, though\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask you, you know , you\u2019 ve been hearing, of course, these concerns r aised by Larry Summers and others about inflation and the fact that they think the Fed  might be \u2014might let things get out of hand with the new policy stance.  So my question is , can you tell us , what is different this time versus previous periods like in the  \u201960s when inflation got out of control ?  Why are you confident with,    with the lags in monetary policy that the Fed can get ahead of inflation and, and  make sure it doesn\u2019 t go too far above the 2 percent  target?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thanks for your question.  S o I actually have a couple things I \u2019d like to say about inflation, including addressing your question.  So let me start with just saying that we\u2019re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  Our , our price stability goal is 2  percent  inflation over the longer run, and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent  over time will help anchor long- term inflation expectations at 2 percent .  With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent  for some time , the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times \u2014above 2 percent  for some time.  So, with a , a little bit of context, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  making our way through an unprecedented series of events, really, in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to widespread reopening of economies  in many places around the world.  In the United States, fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support :  Vaccinations are now widespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum.  During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I \u2019ll discuss why.  But those pres sures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process.  In an episode of one -time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as, and is not likely to lead to , persistently higher year -over-year inflation into the future \u2014inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2  percent  inflation over time.  Indeed, it is the Fed \u2019s job to make sure that that does not happen.  If, if , contrary to expectations, inflation were to move persistently and materially  above 2  percent  in a manner that threatened to move longer -term inflation expectations materially above 2  percent , we would use our tools to bring    inflation and expectations down to mandate -consistent levels.  And I would say, if I may, that is a principal difference from\u2014we \u2019re all very familiar at the Fed  with the history of the 1960s and \u201970s, of course.  And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent  inflation over time.   We\u2019 re committed to that, and we will use our tools to do that.  So that \u2019s a very different situation than you had back in the 1960s \u2014or many, many differences , actually.  So let me talk quickly about the two reasons \u2014two , or you could say three, but really two main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term.  Th e first is the base effect s.  Twelve -month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent  over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation.  That process has alr eady started to show up.  You saw it in the March CPI reading, and you\u2019 ll see it later this week in the PCE price data.  These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.  So, significant increases, and they \u2019ll disappear over the following months.  And they\u2019 ll be transitory.  They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods.   So that \u2019s base effects.  The other big one I would talk about is bottleneck s.  So this is what we \u2019re seeing in supply chains in various industries, and we \u2019re, we\u2019re  in close touch with all of these industries.  You know, the Fed  has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits for that matter,  too.  So what do we mean by a bottleneck?  A bottleneck really is a temporary blockage or restriction in the supply chain for , for a particular good or goods, something that slows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market.  We think of bottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt , and we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they\u2019 re temporary and    expected to resolve themselves.  We know that the base e ffects will disappear in a few months.  It\u2019s much harder to predict with confidence the amount of time it will take to resolve the bottlenecks, or for that matter, the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the meantime.  So, you know, I \u2019ll just sum up and say, we understand our job.  We will do our job.  A nd we are, we are focused \u2014as you\u2019 ve seen, for many years, we \u2019ve been focused on inflation deviating below 2 percent , and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent .  If, if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent  in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent .  No one should doubt that we will do that.  This is  not what we expect .  But no one should doubt that , in the event, we would be prepared to use our tools.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Powell, you said a few weeks ago that  it would \u2014thank you, Chair Powell.  You said a few weeks ago that it would take a string of months of job creation of about a million to achieve progress towards your goal.  Can you define what your , what your  definition of \u201c a string of months \u201d is more specifically?  And , on inflation, the FOMC said the rise in inflation we \u2019re beginning to see largely reflects transitory factors, as you just described .  But why use the word \u201c largely, \u201d and what are the factors driving higher prices that may not be transitory , based on  the initial data that you \u2019re seeing?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, what is \u201c a string \u201d?  What do I mean by \u201c a string \u201d?  Well, I would say, what we have right now is one really good \u2014I can tell you what it \u2019s not.  It \u2019s not one really good employment reading, which is w hat we got in March.  We got close to a million jobs in March and a very strong labor market reading.  And I was just suggesting that we \u2019d want to see    more like that.

It \u2019s going to take some time.  On, on \u201c largely, \u201d there are a bunch of factors.   I was really thinking \u2014we were thinking of the base effects and also the energy effects.  I wasn \u2019t meaning to say there are some real effects.   I mean, there are alway s\u2014there are always relative prices going up and down within inflation.  You know, there \u2019s a basket for CPI or PCE.   There  are, you know, many, many, many factors that go into it.  Relative prices are always moving up and down.  This , this \u2014we think it \u2019s, it\u2019s very fair to say that the increases we see and , frankly , are about to see later this week are largely due to base effects.  It would have been more contentious to say \u201c entirely due to base effects \u201d because there are some things that are always going up , and so we just said \u201c largely. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Over the past decade, the Fed  has invested significant resources in large- scale bank supervision \u2014has completely overhauled that approach.  And it \u2019s even created a special committee that looks horizontally across the largest banks to find common risks.  Did the Fed  not see that multiple banks ha d large exposures to Archegos?  If not, why not?   And then, what regulatory changes would you like to see implemented to change that going forward?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: We\u2019re, we, we  supervise banks to make sure that they have risk -management systems in place so that they can spot these things.  We don\u2019 t manage their companies for them or , or try to manage individual risks.   In the gra nd scheme of these large    institutions, the Archegos risks were not systemically important or were not of the size that they would have really created trouble for any of those institutions. What was troubling, though, was that this could happen in a business for a number of firms that is thought to be \u2014to carry relatively well understood risks.  The prime brokerage business is, is  a well understood business, and so it was surprising that a num ber of them would have had this .  And it was essentially , I believe , the fact that, that  they had the same big risk position on  with a number of firms, and they weren\u2019 t\u2014some of the firms were not aware that there were other firms that had those things.  I , I wouldn\u2019 t say it\u2019 s in any way an indictment of our supervision of  these firms.   It, it\u2014i n some cases, it may be they were \u2014it seems as though there were risk -management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them.

I wanted to ask about digital currency.  You previously said a few times that you think it\u2019 s important for th e U.S. to get a central bank digital currency right rather than be first.  But with countries like China moving very quickly on CBDC, I was wondering what you think the risks are of , of moving too slow on, on digital currency\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right.  So I t hink the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to understand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well.  Central bank digital currencies are now possible, and we\u2019 re going to see some of them around the world.  And we need to understand whether that \u2019s something that would be a good thing for the people that we serve.  How would it work in our system?  And there are some very, very difficult questions to answer, but I think we \u2014and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the technology and the policy issues.     I am\u2014I would say this :  We\u2019re the world \u2019s reserve currency, and that means that the dollar is used in transactions all around the world, far more than any other currency.  And that \u2019s because of our rule of law ; our democratic institutions, which are the best in the world ; our economy;  our industrious people ; all the things that make the United States the United States.  That\u2019s why we \u2019re the , the reserve currency.  And , of course, we have open capital accounts, which is essential if you \u2019re going to be the reserve currency.  So those are the factors that make us the reserve currency.  I am\u2014I\u2019m  less concerned that someone\u2014that another country might have a digital currency f irst.  You know, ask yourself the question, does that mean that , if you were a company that\u2019s doing international business, would you then suddenly start to use that currency to use your\u2014do your international transactions, or would you still do them in dol lars, where , where \u2014which is what everyone does?  And I \u2019m not so concerned about , about  that.  I am really concerned about getting it right.  It is\u2014it is a \u2014it is  a tricky set of questions that we  have to navigate in a world where we already have, remember, a  highly evolved payment system.  We have F edNow and other immediately available funds.  Pretty soon everybody will be able to, to do what people do in other parts of the world , which is just use their phone to make immediately available payments all the time.  It\u2019ll be normal.  A nd what would be the role of a central bank digital currency in that kind of an environment?   Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that we need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead.  I mean, that\u2014what  the China \u2014the currency that \u2019s being used in China is not one that would\u2014that would work here.  It \u2019s, it\u2019s one that really allows the government to see every payment that \u2019s used \u2014for which it is used in real time.   It\u2019s much more to do with things that are    happening within their own financial system than it is, I think, to do with, with  the global \u2014you know, sor t of global competition.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you for taking my question.  I wanted to ask you another question about inflation, and it has to do with inflation expectations.  A n umber of different surveys and, and market indicators are showing, you know, multiyear highs in inflation expectations ratings.  So I wonder ed, you know, if , if that was something that you saw consistent with your inflation outlook.  Is that something that worries you, or do you see that  as, maybe, you know, the success of the F ed\u2019s new inflation framework, you know, making it out to the , to the broader public?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right.  Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit \u2014and here we think of survey, market  based \u2014survey being eith er households or , or economists and , and  market based.  You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what would have been consistent with a 2 percent  inflation target, particularly our 2  percent  inflation target, which calls f or 2 percent  average inflation.  So they\u2019 re at the low end.  Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they\u2019 ve just moved back up to levels broadly\u2014 that, that  are where they were in 2018 , or in some cases 2014 , and, I would say, more consistent with our mandate.  And we want them to be \u2014we want them to be higher and\u2014you know, on a persistent basis.  We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been ru nning for the last quarter of a century.  We want it to average 2  percent , not 1.7 percent .  And for that, we need to see inflation expectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2  percent .  We don\u2019 t really see that yet, but I would sa y that, that, you know, breakevens have moved up,  in a way.  Breakevens    are based on CPI, of course, but they\u2019re, they\u2019re  now at levels that are\u2014 that are  pretty close to mandate consistent , whereas before, they were below.  We monitor inflation expectation s very, very carefully, as you would obviously know.  So  that\u2019s where \u2014that \u2019s where I would say it is.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Just o ne small follow -up.  Do you have any redlines on inflation readings  where if, you know, you hit , like, a  certain number on, say, you know, core PC E, that would be, you know, a trigger response from the F ed\n\nCHAIR POWELL: It doesn \u2019t work that way.  You know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re \u2014inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile.  We expect \u2014as I mentioned, we expect core and , and head line PCE to move up because of base effects, and \u2014you know, I \u2014and we expect that to go away.  We, we  also expect these, these  bottleneck effects to come in.  We don\u2019 t know how persistent they \u2019ll be.  We , we think they\u2019 ll\u2014you know, it \u2019s a matter of , of when they will pass through, not whether they will pass through.  But we can \u2019t be confident about the exact timing of that or the size of them.  They don\u2019 t seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we , we don\u2019t know. I mean, you know, this is \u2014this is  all about the reopening of the economy.   That \u2019s what \u2019s happening.  We had it \u2014we were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now, with a lot of help from fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy , and, you know, a great deal of help from vaccination, we \u2019re seeing a strong rebound in activity.  And what \u2019s happening is , it\u2019s, it\u2019s\u2014demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and \u2014the saved -up fiscal transfers and , and people going back to work and thin gs like that.  The supply side will take a little bit of time to adapt.  New restaurants will have to be opened.  The supply of various inputs into the goods part of the economy will have to be brought back up to speed.  And you\u2014you\u2019 re seeing some of that.      That\u2019ll happen over a period of time, over coming quarters.  You\u2019ll see some of the bottlenecks resolved, but the last one may not be resolved for some time.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Brian Ch eung with \u2014hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Ch eung with Yahoo Finance.  I wanted to ask about financial stability , which is a part of the F ed\u2019s reaction function here.  It seems like to people on the outside who might not follow finance daily, they\u2019 re paying attent ion to things like GameStop, now Dogecoin.  And it seems like there \u2019s interesting reach for yield in this market\u2014 to some extent , also Archegos.  So does the F ed see a relationship between low rates and easy policy to those things, and is there a financial stability concern from the F ed\u2019s perspective at this time?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right.  So we look at \u2014financial stability for us is really \u2014we have a broad framework, s o we don\u2019 t just jump from one thing to another.  I know many people just look at asset prices, and they look at some of the things that are going on in the \u2014in the  equity markets, which , which I think do reflect froth in the equity markets.  But really , it\u2014really, we try to stick to a framework for financial stability so we can \u2014so we can  talk about it the same way each time and so we can be held accountable for it.  So one of the areas is asset prices, and I would say some of the asset prices are high.  You are seeing , seeing things in the capital markets that, that  are\u2014that are  a bit frothy.  That \u2019s a fact.   I won \u2019t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it also\u2014it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy.  That \u2019s really what has been moving markets a lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a f ast\u2014a much faster vaccination process and a faster reopening.  So that\u2019s, that\u2019s part of what\u2019 s going on.    The othe r\u2014the other  things, though \u2014you know, leverage in the financial system , is it \u2014is, is not a problem.  That \u2019s a\u2014 that\u2019s a \u2014that was one of the four pillars.  Asset prices was one.  Leverage in the financial system is, is  not an issue ; we have very well capitalized large banks.  We have funding risks for , for our largest financial institutions  that are  also very low.  We do have some funding risk issues around money market funds, but I would say they\u2019 re not systemic right now.  And, and th e household sector is actually in pretty good shape.  It was in \u2014it was in a  very good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis\u2014sorry, the pandemic crisis hit.  There  were real concerns, of course, with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all of that , that the \u2014that the  household sector would, would, would weaken dramatically.  That hasn\u2019t happened.  So, with the fiscal transfers, money that \u2019s on household balance sheets, they \u2019re in good shape.  You see relatively low defaults and that kind of thing.  So the overall financial stability picture is mixed, but, on balance, it \u2019s\u2014you know, it \u2019s manageable,  I would say .  And it\u2019s\u2014by the way, I think it \u2019s appropriate and important for financial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity.  Again, 8\u00bd million people who had jobs in February don\u2019 t have them now, and, you know, there \u2019s a long way to go until we reach our goal.  So that \u2019s what I would say\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: As a follow -up, you mentioned money market pressures .  The Fed didn\u2019 t make changes to interest on reserves or excess reserves.  What was the logic behind that? It seems like SOFR has been drifting closer to zero.  So just hoping for clarification on that.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right.  So the federal funds rate has been well within target and \u2014at target range, and money market funds \u2014money market conditions are , are fine.  We have the ability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case.  We do expect    further downward pressure on, on rates through asset purchases and also the runoff in the \u2014in the  Treasury G eneral A ccount.  But , at this point, we didn\u2019 t see a need for \u2014to, to deploy our tools to, to support rate s.  And , of course, we will do so if , if the need does arise.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.   I wanted to ask a , a similar question.  We are seeing elevated market valuations , and some economists are concerned that the economy might overheat, at least for a period of time.  So should the F ed and other regulators be thinking about tightening capital requirements or extending oversight to the nonbank sector so that financial stability risk s stay as low as they have been?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I think capital requirements for banks are, to me \u2014went up tremendously, really, over the course of the 10 years between the financial crisis and the arrival of the pandemic.  And the banks really made it through a real stress test very well and passed three , three  of our \u2014two of our stress tests, and that is another one that \u2019s pending.  So capital is, is in a good place , as far as I \u2019m concerned, in the banking system.  But, to your point , what we saw was\u2014so what , what  kind of happened during the pandemic crisis that , that  requires attention, and number one is money market funds and corporate bond funds where we saw run dynamics again, and we need to \u2014we \u2019re, we\u2019re  looking at that.  So we \u2019re looking at ways , and people around the world are looking at ways , to make those vehicles resilient so that they don \u2019t have to be, you know, supported by the government whenever there\u2019 s, you know, severely stressed market conditions.  It\u2019 s a private business.  They , they need to have the wherewithal to stay in business and not just count on the F ed and others to\u2014around the world to come in.  So that was that.     The other one is T reasur y market structure.   Dealers are committing less capital to that activity now than they were 10 or 15 years ago, and the need for capital is higher because there \u2019s so much more supply of Treasuries.  And so there are some questions about T reasur y market structure, and there \u2019s a lot of careful work going on to understand whether there \u2019s something we can do about this , because we\u2014you know, the U.S. T reasury market is probably the most single important \u2014single most important market in , in the economy and  the world.   It needs to be  liquid.  It needs to function well for the good of our economy and the good of our citizens.  So it\u2019s not clear what , what \u2014where that takes you, but we, we are taking a careful look\u2014and the T reasury Department is , is really going to be leading this \u2014at, at Treasury market structure and all of the various aspects of that to make sure that we do have a resilient, strong Treasury market that can work even in difficult times.  As , as you know, at the very beginning of the financial \u2014of the \u2014of this recent crisis, there was such a demand for selling T reasuries, including by foreign central banks, that , really , the dealers couldn \u2019t handle the volume.  And so what was happening was , the ma rket was really starting to lose function, and that\u2019s \u2014that was a really serious problem which we had to solve through really massive asset purchases.  And, you know, so we \u2019d like to , we\u2019d like to see if there isn \u2019t something we can do to\u2014is \u2014do we need to build against that kind of an extreme tail risk, and if so, what would that look like?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, F ed Chairman , for the question.  So I\u2019m interested in your thoughts.  There \u2019s so much fiscal he lp and accommodation from the Federal Reserve.  You said today the vaccinations will follow the normal economic conditions or , or lead to more normal economic conditions later this year.  When do you see the economy being able to stand on its own feet, so to speak ?  And, along those lines, with the fiscal spending and the    accommodation you talked about with transitory inflation, does more spending need to be injected into the system, or will that affect that transitory nation \u2014nature of the inflation?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  When will the economy be , be able to stand on its own feet?   I\u2019m not sure if \u2014I\u2019m not sure what the exact nature of that question is.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: What , what  I\u2019m saying is, is, you know, when will the \u2014when will you need to lower the , the amount of T reasuries you \u2019re buying to  sort of taper off a little bit?  When can it stand without having that support from the monetary policy side?  And then\u2014and then, further,  the transitory.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Okay.  Sorry.  So we have \u2014you know, we \u2019ve articulated our test for that, as you know, and that is just , we\u2019ll continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress.  And we \u2019re, we\u2019re  going to communicate well in advance of any decision.  W e\u2019re going to let, you know, the , the public know that that \u2019s what we\u2019 re thinking.  And, and so there \u2019ll be a lot of warning and that kind of thing.  But it\u2019 s about substantial further progress toward our goals.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s  really all it is.  It doesn \u2019t have any , any external, virus -related specific requirement , although, again, I do think it \u2019ll\u2014you know, the , the virus will need to continue to be controlled for us to achieve those economic goals.  But it\u2019 s really the economic  goals.  Now, your second question.  Sorry , just say again.  I didn\u2019 t quite get th at question.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Yes, sure.  With all the fiscal spending that\u2019 s happened and the accommodation and \u2014does , does  the system need more spending either from the fiscal side or accommodation , or would more spending affect the transitory nature of the inflation and put those upward, upward pressures on inflation long term?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So it \u2019s really up to Congress.   We\u2014we \u2019re not an advis er to Congress.  You know, we don\u2019 t, we don\u2019t  weigh in on specific fiscal bills or proposals.  That \u2019s really between elected parties.  You know, basically, fiscal policy is the province of people who stand for democratic election and win, and they get to make those very difficult decisions , and they get to be accountable to the voters.  We didn \u2019t do any of that, and we don\u2019 t have a seat at that table.  We don\u2019 t seek a seat at that table.  So that \u2019s really something for Congress and the Administration to , to deal with.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Thank you\u2014thank you so much for the\u2014for the  opportunity.   I wanted to circle back to the housing market.  I t\u2019s just kind of confusing that the question and your answer \u2014you know, the housing market is strong, prices are up.  And yet the F ed is buying $40 billion per month in mortgage -related assets.  Why is that, and are those purchases playing a role at all in pushing up prices?   Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  I, I mean, we \u2019re\u2014we  started buying MBS becaus e the mortgage -backed security market was, was  really experiencing severe dysfunction, and we \u2019ve sort of , sort of  articulated, you know, what our exit path is from that.  It \u2019s not meant to provide direct assistance to , to the housing market.  That was never the intent.  It was really just to keep that as \u2014it\u2019s a very close relation to the Treasury market and a very important market on its own.  And so that \u2019s, that\u2019s  why we , we bought as we did during the Global F inancial C risis; we bought MBS too.  Again, not , not an intention to send help to the housing market, which was , which was  really not , not a problem this time at all.  So \u2014and, you know, it \u2019s, it\u2019s a situation where we will, we will  taper asset purchases when the time comes to do that, and those , those  purchases will come to zero over time.

Since I a m last, let me go back to Paul\u2019s question, the first question, and ask him \u2014ask you whether \u2014not whether you \u2019re thinking about thinking of  tapering , but why you\u2019 re not.  We\u2019re seeing bank lending fall.  The markets seem to be operating well.  Are you afraid of a taper tantrum?  O r is it, as one money manager put it, \u201cIf you get out of the markets, there aren \u2019t enough buyers for all of the T reasury debt , and so rates would have to go way up\u201d?  The b ottom -line question is , what do we get for $ 120 billion a month that we couldn\u2019 t get for less?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So it \u2019s really not more complicated than this.  We, we  articulated the \u201csubstantial further progress \u201d test at our December meeting .  And, really , for the  next couple of months, we made relatively little progress toward our goals.  And, remember, substantial further progress from December \u2014from our December meeting.   And then vaccination started to get more widespread.  The economy reopened.  We got a really nice job report for March.  It doesn \u2019t constitute substantial further progress.  It\u2019s not close to substantial further progress.  We\u2019re hopeful that we will see along this path a way to that goal .  And we believe we will; it just is a question of when.

You \u2019re, you\u2019re  very faint.   So if someone has the volume, they can turn it up.  But if we bought less, you know, no.  I mean, I think the effect is proportional to the amount we buy.  It \u2019s, it\u2019s really part of overall accommodative financial conditions.  We, we  have tri ed to create accommodative financial conditions to support economic activity, and we did that.  And we articulated the \u2014you know, the , the tests for withdrawing that accommodation.  And we think, you know \u2014so we \u2019re waiting to see those tests to be fulfilled b oth for asset purchases and for liftoff of rates.

Widespread vaccinations and fiscal policy actions are also contributing to the strong economic recovery.The recovery has progressed faster than expected, but it is still incomplete and uneven. The economy's path depends on the virus and measures taken to control it, and while progress has been made with vaccinations, new cases are still a concern. However, continued vaccinations and adherence to public health guidance should lead to a return to normal economic conditions later this year. The labor market has also improved, with employment rising in March, but there is still a significant shortfall compared to pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate remains elevated and understates the employment shortfall due to low labor market participation.The economic downturn has disproportionately affected the most vulnerable Americans, particularly lower-wage workers in the service sector and African Americans and Hispanics, causing great uncertainty about the future. While inflation readings have increased and are expected to rise further in the near term, these price increases are likely to be temporary and the Federal Reserve's response to the crisis is guided by their mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) aims to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time to ensure inflation averages 2 percent over time and inflation expectations remain anchored. They will maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until employment and inflation outcomes are achieved, keeping interest rates low and increasing holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) emphasizes that their actions are solely dedicated to fulfilling their public mission. They assure their commitment to supporting the economy until the recovery is fully achieved and express gratitude before inviting questions.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet? Have you and your colleagues had any conversations to this effect?\n'ANSWER': No, it is not time yet. We will inform the public when it is time to have that conversation, well in advance of any decision to taper asset purchases. We are currently monitoring progress towards our goals, and it will take some time before we see substantial further progress.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed's approach to normalizing policy if herd immunity is not reached and there is still a baseline level of infection?\n'ANSWER': The Fed defers to health experts on herd immunity, but controlling the virus remains crucial for economic recovery. People need to feel safe to resume activities involving crowds, and some parts of the economy may not fully recover until the pandemic is behind us. The Fed has specific guidance for tapering asset purchases and raising interest rates based on progress towards their goals of maximum employment and 2% inflation. The path of the virus will impact their ability to achieve these goals.", "QUESTION: What happens if inflation expectations were to move up before a return to full employment?\n\nANSWER: It is unlikely that inflation would move up in a persistent way while there is still significant slack in the labor market. Inflation and maximum employment conditions tend to move together. If inflation were to move up in a way that starts to move inflation expectations up, it would take some time and strong labor markets. The Federal Reserve would weigh various factors, including the time it would take to reach both goals, if they were in conflict.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve consider COVID infection rates and the virus when determining monetary policy and tapering?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve aims for substantial progress in both economic outcomes and virus control before considering tapering. They do not have a separate test for the state of the virus and focus primarily on economic goals, but acknowledge the need for significant progress in controlling the virus to achieve those goals.", "'QUESTION': Do you expect there to still be some long-term scarring in the economy and what are you most worried about?\n'ANSWER': We were worried about long-term scarring in the labor market and small businesses, but so far we haven't experienced that level of scarring. However, we are still far from full employment and the economy will be different. Many service sector workers may struggle to find the same job and will need help. Our policy aims to get people back to work quickly.", "'QUESTION': Do you have concerns that there are localized housing bubbles or that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the potential for that, and what is the Fed doing to monitor or address this?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is monitoring the housing market carefully and acknowledges that housing prices are going up due to strong demand and limited supply. While it is a problem for entry-level buyers, there are no concerns of a housing bubble or financial instability in the sector. The hope is that builders will increase supply and workers will return to the industry.", "'QUESTION': Do you see the labor market challenges, such as businesses struggling to find workers and people hesitant to return due to COVID-19 concerns, as temporary issues or long-term problems?\n'ANSWER': There are multiple factors at play, including a mismatch of skills, geographical differences, closed schools affecting childcare, and virus fears. Additionally, many people claim to be retired, but it's uncertain if they will reenter the labor market as conditions improve. Labor shortages are being reported, but wages have not yet increased. As unemployment benefits expire in September, the labor market may reach equilibrium, but it could take some time.", "'QUESTION': What is different this time versus previous periods like in the '60s when inflation got out of control? Why are you confident that the Fed can get ahead of inflation and make sure it doesn't go too far above the 2 percent target?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is strongly committed to achieving maximum employment and price stability. They believe that having inflation average 2 percent over time will anchor long-term inflation expectations. While there may be temporary upward pressure on prices due to reopening, the Fed will use their tools to prevent persistently higher inflation.", "'QUESTION': Can you define what your definition of \"a string of months\" is more specifically? And why use the word \"largely\" when referring to the rise in inflation?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell clarified that \"a string\" refers to consistent job creation, not just one strong employment reading. He emphasized that the economy is still far from its goals and substantial further progress is needed. Regarding inflation, the word \"largely\" was used to acknowledge that while transitory factors like base effects and energy prices are driving the increase, there are always relative price movements that contribute to inflation.", "'QUESTION': Did the Fed not see that multiple banks had large exposures to Archegos? If not, why not? And then, what regulatory changes would you like to see implemented to change that going forward?\n'ANSWER': We supervise banks to ensure they have risk-management systems in place, but we don't manage their companies or individual risks. The Archegos risks were not systemically important, but it was troubling that multiple firms had the same big risk position without being aware of each other. It may indicate risk-management breakdowns at some firms, and we are investigating.", "'QUESTION': Are you planning to visit the homeless encampment near the Fed in Washington?\n'ANSWER': Yes, I plan to visit the homeless encampment when it's no longer a news story. I believe it's important to talk to people and understand their lives. Homelessness is a complex issue and the Fed doesn't have all the tools to address it, but I will visit when the need arises and it's not in the public eye.", "QUESTION: Is there anything specific the Chair would be looking to learn from the encounter?\nANSWER: The Chair does not have any specific expectations, as they believe they already know what they will find. They emphasize the importance of connecting with people and understanding that they are just like us, which influences their work.", "'QUESTION': What are the risks of moving too slow on digital currency, considering other countries like China are moving quickly on central bank digital currency (CBDC)?\n\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is focused on understanding the technology and policy issues surrounding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). While other countries may be moving ahead, the priority is to get it right rather than rushing to reach conclusions. The unique factors that make the US the world's reserve currency, such as rule of law and open capital accounts, make the adoption of another country's digital currency less concerning. The Chinese digital currency is more focused on their domestic financial system rather than global competition.", "'QUESTION': Are the high inflation expectations consistent with the Fed's inflation outlook?\n'ANSWER': Inflation expectations were previously at the low end of the 2 percent target, but have now moved up to levels more consistent with the Fed's mandate. However, they are not yet well anchored at 2 percent. Breakevens have also increased and are now close to mandate consistent levels. Inflation expectations are closely monitored.", "'QUESTION': Do you have any redlines on inflation readings where if you hit a certain number on core PCE, that would trigger a response from the Fed?\n'ANSWER': Inflation measures are always volatile. We expect core and headline PCE to increase due to base effects and bottleneck effects. We can't be confident about the timing or size of these effects. The reopening of the economy is driving a strong rebound in activity, but it will take time for the supply side to adapt and resolve bottlenecks.", "'QUESTION': Is there a relationship between low rates and easy policy to the recent market trends like GameStop and Dogecoin, and does the Fed have concerns about financial stability?\n'ANSWER': The Fed acknowledges that some asset prices are high and there is froth in the equity markets, but it is also influenced by the vaccination and reopening of the economy. Leverage in the financial system is not a problem, large banks are well capitalized, and funding risks are low. The household sector is in good shape with fiscal transfers supporting balance sheets. Overall, the financial stability picture is mixed but manageable, and accommodative financial conditions are necessary to support economic activity.", "'QUESTION': What was the logic behind the Fed not making changes to interest on reserves or excess reserves despite money market pressures and SOFR drifting closer to zero?\n\n'ANSWER': The federal funds rate is within the target range and money market conditions are fine. The Fed can use administrative tools to maintain this. They expect rates to decrease further through asset purchases and the Treasury General Account runoff. Currently, there is no need to deploy additional tools, but they will do so if necessary.", "QUESTION: Should the Fed and other regulators consider tightening capital requirements or extending oversight to the nonbank sector to maintain financial stability given the elevated market valuations and concerns of overheating?\n\nANSWER: Capital requirements for banks are in a good place, but attention is needed for money market funds and corporate bond funds to make them resilient without relying on government support. Treasury market structure is also being examined to ensure its resilience and functionality, especially during times of crisis.", "'QUESTION': When do you see the economy being able to stand on its own feet, so to speak? And, along those lines, with the fiscal spending and the accommodation you talked about with transitory inflation, does more spending need to be injected into the system, or will that affect that transitory nature of the inflation?\n\n'ANSWER': I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what the exact nature of that question is.", "'QUESTION': When will the Fed need to lower the amount of Treasuries it's buying and taper off its monetary policy support?\n'ANSWER': We will continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress and will communicate well in advance of any decision. The progress towards our economic goals is the main factor, although controlling the virus is also important. I didn't understand the second question.", "'QUESTION': Does the system need more spending from the fiscal side or accommodation, and would more spending affect the transitory nature of inflation and put upward pressures on inflation long term?\n\n'ANSWER': It is up to Congress to decide on additional spending. The Federal Reserve does not advise Congress on specific fiscal bills or proposals. Fiscal policy is the responsibility of elected officials who are accountable to the voters, and the Fed does not seek a role in that decision-making process.", "QUESTION: Why is the Fed buying $40 billion per month in mortgage-related assets if the housing market is strong and prices are up?\n\nANSWER: The Fed started buying mortgage-backed securities (MBS) because the MBS market was experiencing severe dysfunction. The purchases were not meant to directly assist the housing market, but rather to maintain the stability of the MBS market, which is closely related to the Treasury market. The Fed will taper asset purchases and eventually bring them to zero, but the time for that has not yet come.", "'QUESTION': Why is the Federal Reserve not considering tapering its asset purchases?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is not considering tapering because they have not yet seen substantial further progress towards their goals. While there has been some progress with widespread vaccination and economic reopening, it is not enough to meet their criteria. They will act based on actual data, not forecasts, and need to see more data before considering tapering.", "'QUESTION': Does buying less in asset purchases still have the same effect on the economy as leaving rates unchanged?\n'ANSWER': The effect of asset purchases is proportional to the amount bought, as it contributes to overall accommodative financial conditions. The Federal Reserve has set tests for withdrawing accommodation, and they will wait for those tests to be fulfilled before making any changes. The decision to taper asset purchases and raise interest rates will be guided by whether the macroeconomic conditions meet the articulated tests.", "'QUESTION': Thank you very much.
