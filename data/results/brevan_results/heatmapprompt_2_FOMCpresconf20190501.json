Steve Liesman, CNBC.  As the statement noted, core inflation is now running below 2 percent \u2014it\u2019s been falling for three straight months , and while you\u2019 ve been close, it \u2019s only been at 2 percent or above one month since 2012.  Mr. Chair , I guess I wonder , is it time to address low inflation through policy , and can you give us some sense of your metric for when it would be time?  At what level would it require a policy response from the Committee?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis.  As I mentioned, we think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don\u2019 t see a strong case for moving in either direction.  I would point out that inflation actually ran\u2014including core inflation \u2014actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.   As you point out, both headline and core , though, did come in on the soft side in the first quarter , and that was not expected as it relates to core.  So we say in our S tatement of Longer -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.  So \u201c persistent \u201d carries the sense of something that \u2019s not transient, something that will sustain over a per iod of time.  And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient.  And I \u2019d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things.  In addition, the    trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.  I ndeed, the Dallas trimmed mean is at 2 percent.   But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent \u2014inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Shifting gear s a little bit, I wondered if you could flesh out \u2014I know you\u2019 re describing it as a small technical adjustment , but on the IOER federal funds spread, give us a sense of why it matters whether or    not this breaches the upper limit a little bit.  Is there any f eed-throug h to broader credit conditions and financial conditions that you worry about , or is it simply a matter of the Fed showing that it can control what it says it\u2019 s controlling?  And I do have a follow -up.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So a small, temporary deviat ion outside of the range would really carry no \u2014wouldn\u2019 t be important, as your question suggests.  But we do think it \u2019s important that we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range.  That \u2019s just good monetary policy, good monetary control.  So we think it \u2019s important , and we have the tools to do that , so we \u2019ve use d them again today .  And, again, this is just a technical fix.  It really has no implications for policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: But a s a follow -up on this, it is demonstrating that you can control the market you want to control.  And I guess the question is , at what point would these steady declines in the IOER \u2014steady widening of this spread , if it continues , essentially become the poli cy choice?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s, I mean \u2014so , generally speaking, the federal funds rate\u2014we control only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate.  And the transmission of the federal funds rate into other short -term rates \u2014money market rate s\u2014has been very good over a long period of time.  And that \u2019s important , because it \u2019s really broader financial conditions that matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate.  So I think the Fed controlling the federal funds rate is actually important from that standpoint , and I don\u2019 t see us not controlling it.  So I think we \u2019ll continue to control it , and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial conditions.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee with Bloomberg.  I\u2019m curious about the financial  conditions that you see out there.  The minutes of the March meeting tell us \u201c a few \u201d officials     worried about financial stability risks.  Was there a broader discussion at this meeting?  Any consensus on whether such risks are growing as the markets hit ne w highs , and we do see some instability in short- end trading \u2014is it possible that rates are too low at this point?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for comment every other meeting.  So we had our quarterly briefing today \u2014yesterday, as a matter of fact\u2014and had that discussion as well.  And I think there haven\u2019 t been a lot of changes since the last meeting , but I \u2019ll just go through the way we think about it.  First, we \u2019ve developed and published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities \u2014put it out for comment and welcome any feedback that we get from the public.  And that enables us to focus our assessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent.   So there are four aspects of it that I \u2019ll go through quickly , but I \u2019d say that the headline really is that while there  are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding is that, overall , financial stability vulnerabilities are mod erate, on balance .  And, in addition, I would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital and liquidity.  But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices.  And as for asset prices, some asset prices  are somewhat elevated , but I would say not extremely so.   Leverage in the financial sector \u2014I mentioned households are actually in good shape from a leverage standpoint.  Default rates are low.  Borrowing is relatively low.  Nonfinancial corporates is an area that we\u2019 ve spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns about that \u2014not so much from a financial stability standpoint , but from the standpoint that having a highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn.      And then the last two \u2014the last two things are really about the leverage in the financial system and funding risk, and those are both very, very low by historic standards in the United States.  So , on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could follow up on that \u2014I\u2019m just curious as to whether the level of asset prices is a reason why you might not be interested in cutting rates.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So we do say that risks to the financial system \u2014we say in our longer -run stat ement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks  to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.  I would say  that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns a re better \u2014capital liquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that.  Those are better first -order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell,  with the benefit of hindsight, did last year \u2019s rate increases make it harder for the Fed to credibly affirm its 2 percent symmetric inflation target is not, in fact , a ceiling?   And, if so, would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation remained  persistently closer to 1 \u00bd percent instead of 2 percent?   And, if not, do you worry about any unwelcome tightening in real rates , given the recent softness in core inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there.  And the economy was quite strong and was growing strong.  The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very positive way.  And so I think the expectation was that inflat ion would remain up around 2 percent.   The weak first quarter performance was not expected \u2014of core was not expected , and I don \u2019t think is related to anything we did , in terms of raising rates.   It appears to be more \u2014we    don\u2019t know this, but you never know until\u2014with hindsight, with perfect hindsight , but some of it does appear to be transient or idiosyncratic.  Now,  the second part of your question?  Sorry.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Well, I mean, if it was an issue, would it be appropriate to lower rates if co re infl ation held closer to 1\u00bd percent?  And, if not, are you worried that there is unwanted tightening from real rates , being where they are?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes, I mean \u2014so , as I said earlier, we do address this in our , sort of , constitutional document.  If infl ation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee , and the Committee would take that into account in making policy.  I do think it \u2019s important that inflation run close to and sustainably \u2014for a sustained period of time \u2014and symmetrically around 2 p ercent .  Because if it doesn \u2019t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can\u2014it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside \u2014inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.   So as you just mentioned, las t year when you guys were kind of getting inflation coming in around 2 percent, you had this benefit of the tailwind of fiscal stimulus.  And you still have that to some extent, although the tax cuts have mostly fe eded through\u2014 we\u2019ve still got something in the pipeline from the spending cap increases.  So , I guess, how do you think about inflation as that fiscal benefit wanes toward the end of this year?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Inflation, first of all\u2014month- to-month, quarter -to-quarter \u2014is going to move around.  Ther e will always be factors hitting it.  So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation    expectations are anchored \u2014the thought being , that \u2019s where inflation will go in the long run if it \u2019s not been pushed by those other factors.  So we also think that slack\u2014the level of slack in the economy does play some small role.  It\u2019s actually still a measurable role.  It\u2019s nothing like it was in the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite  steep, so that \u2019s also something that plays a role.   And so we take all those things into account , and the part of it that we can control is the slack part.  And , again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up.  And if it isn \u2019t and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then that\u2019s something we \u2019d take into account in setting policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN.  Pivoting a little bit\u2014about wages, since 2010, women\u2019 s real earnings have gone up about 3.9 percent compared to men\u2019s, which have risen about 2.1.  Do you think the relative increase in women\u2019 s wages is a problem for the U .S. economy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, I think, generally, I \u2019d have to see the data on that.  It sounds like you picked a particular time frame .  Over time, I really wonder whether that \u2019s the case.  You know, I think men and women should make the same for the same work, by and large.  So\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Just to push a little bit on this .  But if the data shows that women \u2019s wages are rising higher, is there a damage to the U .S. economy if male\u2019 s wages are declining or not growing as fast as women \u2019s?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I think we \u2019re getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the Fed indirectl y, and that \u2019s something I \u2019d rather avoid.  It\u2019s really not my role to engage with potential nominees to the F ed, so I \u2019m really not going to go there.

I wanted to ask \u2014early last month, I believe it was April 2, the Fedwire \u00ae system went down.  A nd I was just wondering if you could talk about what happened there, how long it lasted, whether you know what happened, whether you\u2019re still looking into it, and whether it\u2019 s something that could happen again.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So that \u2019s right.  I want to say it was April 1 , but it may have been April 2.  In any case, the Fedwire\u00ae did go down for a few hours, in the three - or fou r-hour range.  We were able to quickly identify the problem :  It was an internal problem , and we were able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat themselves.   So, you know, we learn from these instances .  They \u2019re fairly rare , but we learn from them , and in this case it was interna l, and it \u2019s been corrected.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.   Next month, we have the 10th anniversary of the end of the recession , and there are some countries that have had expansions for 15, 20, 25 years.  Do you think that \u2019s something that \u2019s practical for the U .S., that  we could have that kind of lengthy expansion?  And for you personally, if we had a recession during your tenure,  would you consider that a failure?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, I wouldn\u2019 t want to speculate.  There \u2019s always the example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of , where I think they \u2019re in year 28 of their expansion.  So things are possible.  All I c an see is that we have an economy where the expansion is continuing.  Growth is at a healthy level.   The labor market is strong.  We see job creation.  We see wages moving up.  Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient , and we do expect it  to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent.  So I see us on a good path for this year.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Do you see parallels with the 1990s , when \u2014for example, some people have pointed out, in the U .S., the longest expansion before this one , there was a rate cut in 1995, and rates went up , and then they came down , and there was that kind of management.  Do you see similarities in today \u2019s situation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Similarities in the length.  I mean, the situations were quite different then.  This was before inflation really was under control , but, you know, it\u2019 s very interesting to look at the history.  I find it quite interesting to look at different periods.  But I think, in our own cycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really wh at\u2019s relevant for us now.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Paul Kiern an from Dow Jones Newswires.  Thanks for the question.  In the l ast 23 years, core PCE inflation has run above 2 percent only during the period that coincided with the housing bubble.  I\u2019d like to know what you would say to people who worry that it will pr ove difficult for the F ed to lift inflation without potentially stoking another asset bubble of some sort.  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  So you\u2019 re pointing to, really , the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below.  And that includes us, although we \u2019ve actually done \u2014   we\u2019ve come closer, I think, than most others.  And it \u2019s just a question, I think, of demographic and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent , and it creates significant challenges.  One, I would say, is , it means that interest rates will be lower \u2014will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because t hat means lower interest rates.  And that \u2019s one of the reasons we \u2019re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year \u2014to think about that problem.  You mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower -for-longe r rates , and that is another challenge.  As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the extent they threaten achievement of our goals , but we also view, and I do take the view that macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do right through the cycle \u2014those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Th ank you.

So isn\u2019 t that a dark cloud on your outlook for strong growth for the rest of the year?  I mean, how much weight does it hold for you, and is it a sign that monetary policy might be too tight?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning , on manufacturing.  Ye s, we see that reading as \u2014it\u2019 s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth.  Manufacturing has been weak all around the world.  Services have been growing faster.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for doing this.  You mentioned\u2014talked about domestic growth a little bit with the economy.  You mentioned that the progress in the talks with China trade, progress in talks with Japanese trade, the USMCA is moving or going to move through Congress.  Could you talk about a little bit of the domestic growth that you \u2019re seeing going forward for the rest of the year ?  And could these trade deals turn into tailwinds for the economy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Our outlook and my outlook is for\u2014is a positive one, is a healthy one for the U .S. economy for growth for the rest of this year.  A nd I would say that the basis for that, really , is consumer spending and business investment.  So if you look at consumer spending, you saw stronger retail sales, stronger motor vehicle sales in March.  A nd, as I mention ed, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of consumer spending \u2014that\u2019s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, high levels of employment, wages going up.  All those things are going to support consumer spending.  So that \u2019s a significant part of the outlook this year.  And business investment should also be positive in that sort of direction.  In terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the uncertainty a round these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business sentiment.  We have been hearing from our business contacts , really , a lot since the beginning of the trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern.  If you import metals or  whatever for your product or export your product, then it \u2019s been a challenge for you.  So that would be a positive.  And, of course, most of the gains , though, I would expect, even from a successful trade negotiation, would come in over time.  You know, I don\u2019t think\u2014i t wouldn\u2019 t be the kind of thing where you \u2019d immediately feel big effects right away , but they could be quite important over a    longer period.  So that, I think\u2014that would be my expectation.  I don \u2019t know , though.  I haven \u2019t seen\u2014none of us, at  least I haven \u2019t seen, the details of what \u2019s been negotiated.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Don Lee with the L .A. Times.   Getting back to inflation, can you talk more about the transitory factors holding down inflation, how significant they are, and why you think those facto rs will pass?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  Well, I would just mention a couple.  Let me say, I don \u2019t mean to diminish concerns about too- low inflation , but I think there \u2019s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors.  One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag.  And so when asset prices went back up, probably there\u2019 ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.  Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel , and apparel prices were very, very low.  There was a change in the methodology.  And another one is airfares.  There are many little things.  So we don\u2019 t know until, again, until we see , but there \u2019s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn around.  And another way to look at it is , there are models that look at inflation in different ways , like\u2014not models, but measures , like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned.   So trimmed mean\u2014it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories , and it didn\u2019 t go down at all.  It\u2019s at 2 percent \u2014or it\u2019s at, I don\u2019 t know whether it went down  or was above that , but it \u2019s at 2 percent now.  So there \u2019s reason to think that these will be transient.  We, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case.   I would point to the case of cell phone  services.  Many of you wil l remember , in March of 2017, there was a    very low reading for cell phone services \u2014mobile phone services \u2014and it was kind of a price war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year , but it did not look like something that would be repeated.  And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation.  So, again, we\u2019 ll have to see here.   We \u2019re going to be watching \u2014really, I \u2019d like to say we\u2019re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that t hese things are transient , and I \u2019ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.

On the regulatory side, the F ed and other bank regulators are said to be weighing all options for retooling  a proposal to revise the Volcker r ule.  Can you give any indication how close the agencies are to coming to a solution and what that solution might look like, whether it would be starting from scratch entirely or making changes to the original proposal?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know , we put out a proposal on Volcker some time ago, and we got a lot of comments , and we\u2019 re reviewing them carefully.   I really don \u2019t have a lot for you.  I know they \u2019re making good progress.  I don\u2019 t really have a date though.  And in terms of what all it\u2019s going to be, it \u2019s not something I can say with any certainty yet.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi there. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  So given what you \u2019ve said about the expectations for consumption and also business fixed investment perhaps bouncing back in the next GDP reading, I \u2019m wondering if you think that continued growth in economic activity might show some sort of underlying fundamental that could flag another overheating.   For example, the median projection in the March meeting for GDP growth for 2019 was 2.1, so I \u2019m just kind of curious about what you see going forward if we continue to see strong GDP numbers.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, we don\u2019 t see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing.  We see inflation below 2 percent now \u2014as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last year.  So, really, no signs of overheating.  If you look at the labor market, for a long time now there have been anecdotal reports of labor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing.  Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate , given inflation and given productivity , but not at all signaling any overheating at all.  It\u2019s not higher than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity .  So, really not seeing signs of overheating at the moment.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Are wages ever going to get back above 4 percent in this cycle?  Can you kind of give us a read on\u2014but more substantively, can you give us a read on how the Committee views productivity growth, if it\u2019 s accelerating enough?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: .  Ye s\u2014in terms of wages getting over 4 percent, wages have moved up pretty steadily over the last five years and are now \u2014wages and ben efits are now b etween 3 and 3\u00bd percent.  Just for the last couple of years, the biggest part of the gains have come for people at the lowest end of compensation and education, which is kind of a welcome thing.  You mentioned productivity.  So productivity is really very difficult to predict.   No one has been able to predict it successfully, so I won\u2019 t really try.  But I will say this :  Productivity was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years.  Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher.  I don \u2019t know if that level can be sustained , but we really \u2014it\u2019s driven, to some extent , by technological developments and, really , the diffusion of technology through the economy , and it \u2019s very hard to predict.  So I think it \u2019s positive.  In fact, I\u2019ll mention, if we \u2019re talking about the supply side, labor force participation.  Really , there has been a significant positive supply -side development over the last year  and a half between the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also productivity.  And that does suggest more room to grow.  It suggests that a less tight economy , a less, you know \u2014may be part of the explanation for lower inflatio n.

The Committee believes that solid underlying fundamentals will support healthy GDP growth for the rest of the year.The Committee acknowledges that inflation has been below the 2 percent objective during the expansion, but notes that it increased last year when the unemployment rate was low. Despite fluctuations, core inflation remained close to 2 percent, but overall inflation fell at the beginning of this year due to oil price declines. The 12-month overall inflation rate for March was 1.5 percent, and unexpectedly, core inflation also fell to 1.6 percent. The Committee suspects that transitory factors may be at play, but remains optimistic that with a strong job market and continued growth, inflation will eventually return to 2 percent and remain symmetric around the longer-term objective.Despite initial concerns about weak global growth, a disruptive Brexit, and unresolved trade negotiations, risks have somewhat decreased as global financial conditions have improved and progress has been made in trade talks between the US and China. The Committee sees these positive developments, along with continued growth, a strong job market, and low inflation pressures, as reasons to maintain patience in assessing further adjustments in monetary policy. Additionally, consequential decisions have been made about the balance sheet, including the continuation of current policy regime and a slower pace of balance sheet runoff.The FOMC had a preliminary discussion about the longer-run maturity composition of the portfolio, which is currently weighted toward longer-term securities due to purchases made after the financial crisis. They plan to further analyze and discuss this matter later in the year, but there is no immediate need for resolution and any decisions made will be implemented with advance notice for smooth adjustment. Additionally, a small technical adjustment was made to the interest rate on excess reserves.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made a change to the IOER rate, but this does not indicate a shift in monetary policy. The IOER rate is used to maintain the federal funds rate within the target range, and as the balance sheet normalization continues, the effective federal funds rate is expected to gradually increase relative to the IOER rate.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Is it time to address low inflation through policy and what level would require a policy response from the Committee?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is strongly committed to achieving its 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained and symmetric basis. While inflation has been running below 2 percent, the current policy stance is seen as appropriate and there is no strong case for moving in either direction. If inflation were to persistently run below 2 percent, the Committee would be concerned and take it into account when setting policy.", "'QUESTION': Why does it matter if the IOER federal funds spread breaches the upper limit? Is there any impact on broader credit and financial conditions?\n'ANSWER': A small deviation outside the range is not important, but it is crucial for the Fed to control the federal funds rate within the range for good monetary policy and control. This technical fix has no implications for policy.", "'QUESTION': At what point would the steady declines in the IOER and widening of the spread become a policy choice?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve only directly controls the federal funds rate, which has a good transmission into other short-term rates. The focus is on broader financial conditions rather than the precise federal funds rate. The Fed will continue to control it and ensure it transmits well into broader financial conditions.", "'QUESTION': Was there a broader discussion on financial stability risks and whether they are growing as the markets hit new highs?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve has regular discussions on financial stability, with a recent quarterly briefing. While there are some concerns about nonfinancial corporate debt, overall vulnerabilities are moderate. The financial system is resilient with high capital and liquidity, and leverage and funding risk are low by historic standards.", "'QUESTION': Is the level of asset prices a reason why the Federal Reserve might not be interested in cutting rates?\n'ANSWER': Risks to the financial system that could hinder the achievement of the Federal Reserve's goals are taken into consideration. However, tools such as capital liquidity, supervision, stress testing, etc. are more effective in addressing these concerns than monetary policy.", "'QUESTION': Did last year's rate increases make it harder for the Fed to affirm its 2 percent inflation target? Would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation remained closer to 1 \u00c2\u00bd percent instead of 2 percent? Do you worry about tightening in real rates given recent softness in core inflation?\n\n'ANSWER': Inflation was expected to stay around 2 percent last year, but the weak first quarter performance of core inflation was not anticipated and is likely transient or idiosyncratic. Chair Powell did not address the appropriateness of lowering rates or concerns about tightening in real rates.", "'QUESTION': Would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation held closer to 1\u00c2\u00bd percent and are you worried about unwanted tightening from real rates?\n\n'ANSWER': If inflation consistently falls below or exceeds 2 percent, it would concern the Committee and influence policy decisions. It is crucial for inflation to be close to and sustainably around 2 percent to prevent inflation expectations from declining, which could hinder our ability to respond to economic downturns and support the economy during challenging periods.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve think about inflation as the fiscal benefit wanes?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve considers factors such as underlying inflation, inflation expectations, and the level of slack in the economy when thinking about inflation. They believe that the current low inflation reading will be temporary and expect it to move back up. If inflation remains persistently below 2 percent, it will be taken into account when setting policy.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the relative increase in women's wages is a problem for the U.S. economy?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Powell stated that he would need to see the data on the relative increase in women's wages compared to men's. He believes that men and women should make the same for the same work, but questions whether the data presented reflects the overall trend over time.", "'QUESTION': Is there a damage to the U.S. economy if male's wages are declining or not growing as fast as women's?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell avoids commenting on a nominee to the Fed indirectly and states that it is not his role to engage with potential nominees. He also mentions that he hasn't seen the research on this topic, so he cannot provide a definitive answer.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide an update on the Fedwire system outage that occurred in early April, including the duration, cause, and steps taken to prevent future occurrences?\n\n'ANSWER': The Fedwire system experienced a few hours of downtime, which was caused by an internal issue. The problem was quickly identified and resolved, and measures have been implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future. Such occurrences are rare, but valuable lessons are learned from them.", "'QUESTION': Do you think it is practical for the US to have a lengthy expansion like some other countries?\n'ANSWER': It is possible for the US to have a lengthy expansion, as seen in the example of Australia's 28-year expansion. Currently, the US economy is continuing to expand, with healthy growth, a strong labor market, job creation, and increasing wages. Inflation is low, allowing for patience, but the goal is for it to reach 2 percent. Overall, the US is on a good path for this year.", "'QUESTION': Do you see parallels with the 1990s in today's situation?\n'ANSWER': There are similarities in the length of the expansions, but the situations were quite different. Inflation was not under control in the 1990s. While it is interesting to look at history, the current cycle has its own unique challenges that are more relevant for us now.", "'QUESTION': What would you say to people who worry that it will be difficult for the Fed to lift inflation without potentially stoking another asset bubble?\n'ANSWER': In recent years, inflation has been low and many central banks, including us, have struggled to reach their inflation goals. This is due to demographic and global forces that are disinflationary. It means interest rates will be lower more often, which poses challenges. We are reviewing our monetary policy strategies to address this. We consider financial stability concerns, but regulatory tools are the best defense against financial instability.", "'QUESTION': Isn't the recent drop in the ISM manufacturing index a negative sign for the outlook of strong growth for the rest of the year and a possible indication of tight monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': The ISM reading on manufacturing is still positive and in line with our expectations of moderate or modest growth in the manufacturing sector. While we are monitoring it closely, we anticipate a positive contribution to growth from manufacturing despite its weakness globally.", "'QUESTION': Could you talk about the domestic growth for the rest of the year and the potential impact of trade deals on the economy?\n'ANSWER': The outlook for the US economy is positive, driven by consumer spending and business investment. Strong retail and motor vehicle sales, along with supportive economic fundamentals, will support consumer spending. Resolving trade uncertainties could boost business sentiment, although the effects may be gradual over time. The details of the trade deals have not been seen yet.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk more about the transitory factors holding down inflation, how significant they are, and why you think those factors will pass?\n'ANSWER': There are several transitory factors influencing inflation, such as portfolio management services, apparel prices, and airfares. These factors are expected to be temporary and reverse in the future. Measures like the Dallas trimmed mean show that inflation has not decreased significantly. The Federal Reserve will closely monitor inflation to ensure these factors are indeed transitory.", "'QUESTION': So a cut in interest rates would be possible?\n'ANSWER': It's hard to say because there are many variables to consider, but if inflation stays low and is not transient, we would be concerned and take it into account as part of our mandate for stable prices.", "'QUESTION': So a cut in interest rates would be possible?\n'ANSWER': I can't really be any more specific than what I've said.", "'QUESTION': Can you give any indication how close the agencies are to coming to a solution for revising the Volcker rule and what that solution might look like?\n'ANSWER': We put out a proposal on Volcker and are reviewing the comments received. While progress is being made, I cannot provide a specific date or details on the final solution at this time.", "'QUESTION': Do you think continued growth in economic activity could indicate another overheating?\n'ANSWER': We don't see any evidence of overheating. Inflation is below 2 percent and there are no signs of labor shortages or wage increases that would indicate overheating. We are not seeing any signs of overheating at the moment.", "'QUESTION': Are wages ever going to get back above 4 percent in this cycle?

The largest gains have been for those at the lowest end of compensation and education. Predicting productivity is difficult, but it has improved since the crisis. Technological developments and the diffusion of technology drive productivity, making it hard to predict. The increase in labor force participation and productivity suggests room for growth and may explain lower inflation."]}
