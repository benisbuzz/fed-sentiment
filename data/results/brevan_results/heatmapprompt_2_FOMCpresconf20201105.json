It\u2019s Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  I\u2019m wondering if you can speak specifically about what indicators you\u2019 re seeing that suggest the pace of improvement has mod erated, including in the labor market, and how correlated those indicators are to the recent rise in COVID cases that we\u2019ve seen going into flu season.  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So, of course .  Let\u2019s start with February.  In February, we had an eco nomy that was performing well.  Then the pandemic hit, and we had a record decline in    activity in March and April , and then we had a record bounceback in May and June.  And so as I think would have been expected and was expected, the pace of improvement fr om May and June has now moderated, so it \u2019s not unexpected.  And I think if you look at just about anything, you know, for example, the payroll readings, the payroll job gains in May and June were just outsized.  And they \u2019re certainly still very large, but they \u2019ve\u2014but the pace of improvement has moderated.  That \u2019s the case for , for all different measures in the labor force \u2014in the labor market, rather.  Another would be claims.  Just about all the data were\u2014showed a big bounceback.  But then, as you would expect, when, when you sort of had people \u2014a lot of people go back to work at once, the pace will moderate.  Same thing with economic activity.  Most forecasts call for, you know, still a significant growth in the fourth quarter but not at the  33 percent annualized pace that we had in the third quarter.  So, in a sense, that would be \u2014that would be as expected.  We have been concerned that the downside risks, though, are , are prevalent now, which are \u2014which are really the risk of the further spre ad of the disease and also the risk that , that  households will run through the savings they \u2019ve managed to accumulate on their balance sheet and that that could weigh on activity.  But what we see up to the present , really , is, continued growth, continued expansion, but at , at a gradually moderating pace.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Could you talk a little bit about where you think the stimulus package that is being debated in Congress is a nd how severe a threat that could be to the economy if it does not get passed, say, before January \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So it is \u2014obviously, it \u2019s for Congress to decide the timing , size , and components of further fiscal support for the economy, and I will say that the support provided by the CARES Act was absolutely essential in supporting the recovery that we\u2019 ve seen so far, which    has generally exceeded expectations.  And I do think it \u2019s likely that further support is likely to be needed for monetary policy  and fiscal policy .  I just mentioned the two risks that I think we , we face, and those would be well  addressed through more fiscal policy.  One is the further spread of the virus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the savings on people \u2019s balance sheets that will dwindle.  But I , you know, I think it \u2019s appropriate for us not to try to prescribe for Congress exactly what they should do or what the timing of it should be or what the size of it should be and leave it at that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.  To follow on Marty \u2019s question, you really have been saying since April that m ore is needed on the fiscal policy front, and yet we don\u2019 t seem to be that much closer than we were in the spring or the summer to additional spending.  Two questions:  Would the lack of fiscal support compel the Fed to provide additional accommodation, and are you and your colleagues being more vocal about the need for fiscal support because the capacity for monetary policy to support growth is diminished here, given the low level of short - and long -term rates ?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So on your first question, you know, we \u2019ll take into account all external factors and , and do what we think we need to do with the tools that we have to pursue our goals.  That \u2019s what we will do.  And I \u2019ve said it on a couple of occasions that that will go better and move m ore quickly if we have a broad set of policies from across the government.  And we \u2019ve said this in the very beginning :  It\u2019s really , first and foremost , health -care policy, getting the \u2014getting the spread of the virus under control and working on therapeuti cs and vaccines and that kind of thing, getting \u2014so that \u2014those are absolutely critical to the economy.  Now, t hose are important , as well as health policies .  They\u2019re, they\u2019re  going to be critical to the    economy.  Fiscal policy can do what we can \u2019t, which is to replace lost incomes for people who are out of work through no fault of their own.  And then we \u2014what we can do is , we can obviously support financial stability through our lending programs, and, and  we can support demand through, through  interest rates and asset purchases and that sort of thing.   So we \u2019re, we\u2019re going to take the economy as it comes, including all external factors.  So I think all of us lived through the experience of the \u2014of the years after the G lobal Financial C risis.  And for  a number of years there , in the middle of the recovery, fiscal policy was pretty tight.  And . and  I think I just would say that I think we \u2019ll have a stronger recovery if we can just get at least some more fiscal support when it\u2019 s appropriate, you know, when it \u2019s appropriate and in the size Congress thinks is appropriate.  I do think that that will likely \u2014and, by the way, you see, you know, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill that suggests generally that there will be s omething.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, also to follow up on sort of what Nick was talking about, two questions about quantitative easing.  The first is, if the market is functioning better , as you and other Fed officials have said, and QE right now is designed for smooth market functioning, why haven\u2019 t you reduced QE that you\u2019 re doing if the market is functioning better already?  The second question I have is, what good, for the broader economy , would additional QE do at this point, given that interest rates are already low and don\u2019 t seem to be rising even above 1 percent?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , on the first \u2014the first question, it \u2019s\u2014our asset purchases are serving both purchases, both\u2014sorry, both purposes :  financial market function and support for economic activity.  So \u2014and that \u2019s really been true\u2014 I think in the very beginning of the crisis,    the main focus was, obviously, financial , financial  market function, particularly in, in, you know, some of the major markets.  But after that period , we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve understood all along that our purchases are also supporting economic activity, and that \u2019s important.  And that need hasn\u2019 t dwindled at all.  So , so we haven \u2019t looked at reducing purchases . So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say , the purchases that we have in place are providing strong support to economic activity still.  And, by the way, they \u2019re sustaining the gains we \u2019ve made in financial stability.  You know, we don\u2019 t\u2014we  don\u2019 t take anything for granted.  We , we don\u2019t expect that things will deteriorate.  But, nonetheless, we have a habit of keeping things in place for a while.  So we \u2019re not taking our gains in financial market function for granted, although, admittedly , they\u2019ve been very large.  So the asset purchases are just another very important piece of the accommodative policy stance that we have.  A nd, you know, as you know, these \u2014we \u2019re buying $120 billion a month.  That\u2019s $1.44 trillion, if I remember my times tables.  And it \u2019s just providing a lot of support for , for economic activity and, by the way, removing just about the same amount of duration risk from private hands as QE3 did.  So this is a big program, and it \u2019s doing a lot of good.  And we also, today, you know, we had a full discussion of the options around quantitative ease \u2014not quantitative easing, the asset purchase program , and, you know, we understand the , the ways in which we can adjust the parameters of it to deliver more accommodation if it turns out to be appropriate.  Right now, we think that this very large , effective program is delivering about the right amount of accommodation and support for the markets, and so it continues\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  First, it\u2019 s great to see you \u2019re okay.  Chair Powell, what is the risk that we come out of this with lower productivity; weaker labor force attachment;    slower growth; and, important for your tools, Chair Powell, a cycle of lower real interest rates?  And if you think this type of scarring is a risk, then I \u2019m wondering , what \u2019s stopping the Federal Reserve from having a more explicit dialogue with Congress about the particular types of fiscal support w e might need to avoid this outcome to make sure that you push away from the zero boundary or that the economy does when we exit this ?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thank you.  So you did\u2014 you laid out nicely the , the risks of damage to the supply side of the economy , or \u201c scarring, \u201d as you put it.  And we \u2019ve been talking about those since the very beginning of the pandemic.  The risk is that, for example, people are out of the labor force for an extended period of time.  They lose their attachment to the labor force, and it\u2019s harder to get back.   Your skills atrophy.  It\u2019s harder to get back in .  And the record is, if you don\u2019t get back in very fairly quickly, it can be harder to get back in.  And that holds down the whole  economy .  And, by the way, it also\u2014it places enormous burdens on individuals who may have this happen to them at an important stage in their career.  So  it\u2019s, it\u2019s,  it\u2019s important.  And, you know \u2014so that is one of the reasons why our response was so strong  and so urgent at the beginning and why we called this , this  set of risks out.  I don\u2019 t know how we could be much more vocal about it than we have been.  Fortunately , for\u2014 you know, the economic recovery has exceeded , certainly , the downside cases that we w ere very concerned about and even , even  exceeded \u2014sort of exceeded the baseline expectations.  Now, that \u2019s so far.   We are a long way from our goals.  And, you know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re sort of halfway there on the labor market recovery at best.  And , and there are parts of the economy where it \u2019s going to be hard until there \u2019s a vaccine \u2014you know, the parts of the economy.  So, you know, that \u2019s the supply -side damage.  That \u2019s sort of the third thing that we talk about.  The first , at the beginning, it was to provide relief and comfort.  The second \u2014then the second part was to    provide support when\u2014to the  expansion when it came.  And the third was to avoid longer -run damage to the economy , and that \u2019s, that\u2019s  all of these things.  I think we have been vocal.  You know, we\u2019ll, we \u2019ll try to continue to do that.  And , and those are\u2014that \u2019s again \u2014that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies , and unne cessary long -term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s very important that \u2014you know, there is a real threat  here of those things , and, and, you know, we\u2019re trying to do everything we can to minimize that threat.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: [Inaudible]  \u2014look like and whether you anticipate any consequences if they are not extended \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Yes , thanks.  So , first , let me say , we do think that the facilities have , have  generally served their purposes well, particularly in supporting the flow of credit, particularly acting as backstops to private markets.  So, overall, we think that the, the programs have , have  gone well.  In terms of the extension, we are, we are just now turning to that question.  You know, we \u2019ve had a lot of things to work our way through.  Right now we \u2019re just in the process of turning to that question and, of course , not made any decisions.  And in terms of the process, this is a decision that , of course , we have to make and will make jointly with the Treasury Department.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: [Inaudible]  IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopina th wrote \u2014Gita Gopinath  wrote a piece this week in which she said, unequivocally, we \u2019re in a global liquidity trap and    talked about the limits of monetary policy right now.  She said, \u201c Fiscal policy will need to be the main game in town.\u201d   And it \u2019s been a b usy week.  I don \u2019t know if you were able to pick up the pink paper and read that piece, but she does say 97 percent of advanced economies have rates below 1 percent.  And I just wonder if you\u2019 d agree with her , in principle, that we are in a global liquidit y trap , and what the consequences of that would be.  We \u2019ve talked a lot about fiscal policy here domestically, and she talks about the need for sort of a global cohesive approach to, to fiscal policy.  My second question is , you talk about how you follow the epidemiology.  You\u2019re, you\u2019re  looking  [inaudible ]. And I wanted to ask you about how you look at [ inaudible ] Christine Lagarde laying out what the ECB plans to do.  As you lent an ear to what she had to say , the dire warn ings that she was making this morning as she looks at the situation that Europe \u2019s in, what can you and your colleagues learn about the second wave or the third wave that you\u2019 ve talked about and, and we\u2019ve all feared when it comes to a, a  policy response?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Okay , thanks.  So two questions.  First, I, I take the sense of your first question to be , is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo?  A nd the answer to that would be \u201c no,\u201d I don\u2019 t think that.  I think\u2014 I think that we are strongly committed to using these powerful tools that we have to support the economy during this difficult time for as long as needed, and no one should have any doubt about that.  And we do not doubt the power of the things that we \u2019ve already done or the things that we may , may  do in the future.  I do think there \u2019s more that can be done.  And I also think, if you look at the stock of assets that we \u2019ve bought, if you look at the facilities and , and the way we \u2019ve been able to keep accommodat ive financial \u2014financial conditio ns accommodative, I think we \u2019ve been able to do a lot of things that are    providing very strong support for the economy.  And we \u2019re going to \u2014we \u2019re going to keep at that.  I\u2019ve said \u2014we \u2019ve said from the very beginning, though, that this is particular \u2014that the  particular situation we find ourselves in is one where there is a sudden loss of income on, on the part of millions and tens of millions of people.  It\u2019s not so much a typical recession where demand weakens, the Fed cuts interest rates, interest rates stim ulate demand, and the economy recovers.  It\u2019s a sudden shock where tens of millions of people are out of work.  And the fiscal response was , was  frankly, I think, very good and very robust in the United States.  And it \u2019s certainly one of the main reasons w hy the recovery has been as good as it \u2019s been so far.  So I do think fiscal policy is absolutely essential here.  You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing , but where there\u2019 s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy.  And, of course, you need health- care policy too.  I didn\u2019 t see Madame Lagarde\u2019 s comments this morning, but I , I took the sense of that question to be the spread of the disease in Europe , and what do we think about that?  Ye s.  So, as I mentioned in my \u2014in my opening remarks, it \u2019s a concern.  We have a widespread spike in cases across the country, more in some regions than others.  And even if we don\u2019 t have \u2014and I don\u2019t expect that we would \u2014sort of government -imposed restrictions, it does seem likely, though, that people who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying, staying in a hotel, going to restaurants, going to bars , and , and things like that, that they may pull back in a situation where suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city, your state, your community.  So I do think that that \u2019s a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and, and the cases spike.  That, that  could weigh on economic activity.  One would expect that it would.  We thought the same thing, in fairness, about the wave we had this summer in the South and the West .  And the    economy, you know, seemed to move right through that.  This one seems to be larger and more widespread.  In any case, it \u2019s a risk , is what I would characterize it \u2014I would characterize it as a risk, as I did in my \u2014in my comments.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Can I ask a quick follow -up, just about the passions of the Fed Chairman ?  We\u2019ve listened to your rhetoric over the course of this pandemic, and you talked about what the Fed was doing, the reasons for doing it  at first.  You talked about the balance between monetary and fiscal policy.  I think in your recent comments and in Governor Brainard \u2019s comments, certainly , there \u2019s been more passion yet about the need for Congress to do more \u2014I know that you\u2019re  limited in what you can say or the degree to which you\u2019d want to advise Congress, but a simple question:  Do you feel that you\u2019 re being heard?  As you look at the prospects for this economy and potential need for more fiscal policy, do you feel like those who are crafting that policy , or could be , are listening to you and have a firm grasp of what you\u2019 re saying about how that might affect or improve the economy going forward?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So let me \u2014let me  say, in the first instance, our , our main focus is on doing our job, and that is really what we\u2019re, we \u2019re focused on is using the tools that Congress has given us and the assignment they \u2019ve given us.  And I think we \u2019re, we\u2019re\u2014that is the thing that we think about night and day.  I just know from , from  the experience of the last cycle, it helps to have the whole government working on these things, and this one is particularly that way.  And I , I don\u2019t\u2014I think\u2014 you know, I , I don\u2019 t want to say whether I feel like I\u2019m being heard or not .  But, sure , I think there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who, on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill , who see a need for further fiscal action and understand perfectly why that might be the  case.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  So what would cause the Federal Reserve to shift more of its asset purchases towards the long -term securities and Tr easuries and change the amount of spending there also?  And as a second point onto that, you know, would\u2014if there \u2019s no fiscal stimulus package, would that then trigger buying of more long- term assets or change the asset purchases?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I don\u2019 t really have a specific hypothetical I would \u2014I would put to you.  I would just say that we , we understand that there are a number of parameters that we have where we can shift the composition, the duration, you know, the size, the life , life cycle of the p rogram.  All of those things are , are available to us as ways to deliver addition \u2014you know, more accommodation if we think that \u2019s appropriate.  Right now, we , we like the amount of accommodation the program is , is delivering.  And it will just depend on th e\u2014on the  facts and circumstances.  We may reach a view at some point that we need to do more on that front.  Today \u2019s meeting was about analyzing the\u2014one of the things it was about was about analyzing the various ways and having a, you know, good discussion about how to think about those , those  various parameters, which I , I thought was quite a useful discussion\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking the question.  I wanted to ask about climate change.  FHFA Director Mark Calabria recently said that financial regulators need to account for financial change \u2014climate change, I\u2019m sorry.  What are you all thinking of doing on that front beyond what you\u2019 re already doing, and do you have any plans for joining the network for greening  the financial system?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes.  So I , I do think that the public , public  will expect and has every right to expect that we \u2014that in our oversight of the financial system, we will account for all material risks and try to protect the economy and the public from those risks.  Climate change is , is one of those risks.  It\u2019s a relatively \u2014the science and art of incorporating climate change into our thinking about financial regulation is relatively new, as you know.  And we are, you know, very actively , in the early stages of this, getting up to speed, working with our central bank colleagues and other colleagues around the world to t ry to think about how this can be part of our framework.  And we \u2019re watching what other \u2014what other  countries are doing.  We\u2019re active participants, as you know, in the CG \u2014no, the greening the financial s ystem.  And, you know, we haven\u2019 t, we hadn \u2019t actually formally joined, but we \u2019re there.  We \u2019re in the working groups, and we \u2019re doing all of that.  So we \u2019re very much working with and monitoring the things other central banks are doing.  You hear \u2014you know, there \u2019s lots of research going on at the various Reserve Banks and here at the Board in trying to understand this.  These tend to be longer -term risks.  But, of course, the longer term does arrive over time.  And, you know, we take it as our obligation to\u2014 you know, to understand these risks and incorporate t hem into our \u2014into the way we supervise and, and think about the , the overall financial system and the economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Quick follow -up from Gina \u2019s question:   Have you gotten a commitment from Secretary Mnuchin to extend the 13(3) facilities if you decide it\u2019 s necessary, and are you concerned what a lame- duck Trump Administration might do in that regard?  And then, more broadly, on the state of the economy, are y ou comfortable now that the tail risk for worst -case outcomes has been kind of swept aside and minimized at this point ?  Are we down, in    other words, to kind of household- level problems among a large set of households , perhaps , but that the financial crisis, double -dip recession sort of scenarios are , are off the table?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , on your first question, we , we really are just turning to this issue now, and we have not made any decisions.  We , we are just getting started on it, and , and it\u2019 s a decis ion that we \u2019ll make jointly with the Treasury Department.  And that \u2019s, that\u2019s  really all I can say today.  That \u2019s all I have for you on that today.  In terms of the tail risks, I mean, I think clearly the tail risks that we were worried about have , have  subsided.  And, you know, we were worried about very negative potential outcomes.  And that \u2014you know, that \u2019s, that\u2019s \u2014what is to be expected of us is , is to think about how things can go wrong as well as the way things that can go right.  But we , we have to \u2014we  do make policy from a risk -management  standpoint.  We don\u2019 t just look at the most likely case.  We , we ask, \u201cHow do you make policy in light of the risks ?\u201d and often it \u2019s downside risks in a situation like this.  I would not say that anybody \u2019s feeling comfortable about this, though.  You know, we\u2019ve gotten through the first five, six months of the \u2014of the  expansion better than expected, but we do see in Europe \u2014look what \u2019s happening in Europe , look what \u2019s happening here \u2014another spike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more.  So I think we have to be humble about where we are relative to this \u2014to this disease.  It hasn \u2019t gone away.  Clearly, you know, therapeutics are advancing , research on vaccines are advancing , death rates  are way down , hospitalization rates are , are lower now , but\u2014so we \u2019re learning.  But, I mean, we, we are so \u2014we\u2019re very far from saying that we think we \u2019ve got this and eliminated the tail risks.  But I think , clearly , the tail risks have , have  diminished s ince\u2014at least our perception of them has diminished since earlier in the year.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Earlier this summer, I know that you formed a task force to look at the distribution of coins around the S ystem.  I wonder if you can give us an update on how that \u2019s going.   I know there \u2019s been some , some  public relations effort.  I think October was \u201cGet the C oins M oving \u201d month.  Has that \u2014has that  problem subsided?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So let me say why it\u2019 s such an important \u2014you know, in a world where so many payments are made digitally and all that, coins and currency are very important for the relatively low -income people.  And so it \u2019s a really incredibly important part  of the payment system, and we do pay a lot of attention to it.  And I actually just \u2014I just caught up this morning with the \u2014with the  person who heads that operation here who, who  says that, ye s, things have really gotten significantly better on the coin fr ont.  So we worked very hard to increase the supply of coins and, even more than that, the distribution of coins around the S ystem and are happy to say that that situation is well on the way to normalizing itself.   So very pleased to report  that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks very much for the \u2014for the  question, Chair Powell.  We \u2019ve just had a presidential election here in the United States.  We still don \u2019t know who the winner is.  Are you concerned that perhaps tensions or  uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election could pose a risk to the economic outlook or trigger market turmoil ?  And has the Fed had any discussions , either internally or with the Treasury Department , about responding to that, should it  happen?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thanks.  So I \u2019m very reluctant, as you will imagine, to comment on the election directly, indirectly , at all , other than just to say that it \u2019s a good time to take a step back and let the institutions of our democracy do their jobs.  So , at the Fed here, we will, as    always, continue to do our jobs.  Every day we \u2019ll continue to serve the American people using our tools to support the economy during this difficult time.  You know, the \u2014you ask if we had discussions .  I would say, you know, the meeting we just finished, for example, what we do is we talk about the economy and markets, domestically and around the world.  We hear reports on how households and businesses are doing.  We talk about risks to the outlook.  We talk about what the right policy response might be.  And the election comes up in some \u2014you know, it comes up now and again, but it is not at all a central focus of the meeting.  Not at all.  So I, I\u2019ll just leave it at that.  Again, very reluctant to get into anything more than that.   Thanks.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you for taking my question.  Chairman Powell, can you tell us a little bit more about why the minimum loan size under the Main Street facility  was reduced last week and wh y that was done now rather than earlier , seeing that small businesses are still\u2014clearly still\u2014struggling to make the change necessary?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So, we have had very little demand below $1 million in loans.  And part of that just is that the fe e structure is what it is, and that\u2019 s the compensation that the banks get.  And there \u2019s a certain amount of work that they have to do to get \u2014to get  into the loan program and do\u2014 and to document the thing , the loans that they make because these are loans that, you know, go on their balance sheet.  They keep 5 percent, so they actually have to underwrite the credit.   And we \u2019re relying on them , to some extent , for, for  doing that.  And so we were reluctant.  We moved the minimum down to $250,000, and we were re luctant to go below that.  But we heard , over and over again, that it would be great if we could reduce it to $100,000.  So\u2014and, you know, we \u2019ve been saying we\u2019 d have to redesign the program.  And I , I got the question in a \u2014in an oversight hearing a month or so ago with the Secretary  and said that.     And I went back to the office and thought, you know, okay , so what would that look like if we were to redesign the program in a way \u2014what\u2019s the least thing we could do to redesign the program so that we could move  to a lower level?  And it\u2014basically, we concluded we could just change the fee structure to create incentives for that , so we did that.  We try to be responsive.  We want, you know, qualifying businesses to be able to borrow.  And we \u2019ll see how much demand will come.  You know, with, with  these programs, why did it \u2014why didn\u2019 t we do it right away?  We tend to\u2014it\u2019 s\u2014there\u2019 s more work than one might \u2014certainly than I imagined in setting up one of these facilities.  And you , you  just try to get it out there and get it working and not try to do everything before you start it because you \u2019ll never start it if you do that.  Then you get it started, and you make changes.  And we \u2019ve been willing to make changes.  That \u2019s the most recent set of ones that we \u2019ve done.  And, again, we hope \u2014we hope  that it will help some companies, and I guess we \u2019ll find out.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could just follow up on that quickly.  I mean, you spoke [inaudible] about the small business lending pro gram.  But that has only reached 400\u2014there \u2019s only been 400 loans.  When you say the programs are effective, do you not think there \u2019s more that can be done with another type of program or another redesign either  for small businesses or for assisting state and local governments?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes.  There \u2019s a bunch of programs.  I would say that the , you know, the corporate \u2014the larger corporate market -based lending program has been very successful without making a single loan \u2014I think, unambiguously , has been a big success.  I think the success \u2014I think the state and local government progra m has also restored market function so that\u2014whereas, you know, there were the , the sort of individual investors who wind up funding loans in the muni market through. through mutual funds, they , they  had withdrawn a lot of money , and, and that \u2014we \u2019ve had many weeks of consecutive , I believe, of , of inflows there, and you\u2019re largely back to a normal functioning market.  I think that \u2019s also been a success.  I think the other \u2014certainly the , the funding market programs have been a big success.    The\u2014Main Street is just\u2014is just a bigger challenge than all of them.  Reaching out to small and medium- sized businesses through the banking system , which we had to do, is , is quite challenging.  I do think, you know, the grant programs, the PPP , were, were  a great way to reach smaller companies.  You know, what you hear out there is that demand\u2014 you talk to banks , and they\u2019ll say demand for loans is very, very low right now.  Companies are not borrowing .  And, and the reason is that, you know, activity \u2019s at a relativ ely low level.  They don\u2019 t want to run up their debt.  You know, so I \u2014we put , we put  an awful lot into Main Street, and it is very challenging to reach a lot of those companies.  But  I\u2014you know, I think we , we are reaching many of them now , and, a nd I hope  that the new changes will help us reach more.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, there \u2019s a small but growing number of people , including some former Fed economists , who say you should find ways to go beyond your mandate to provide additional support to the economy , which, in essence, would be fiscal support , since it hasn \u2019t come from Congress.  One of the suggestions is buying state and municipal securities directly.  Another is perhaps following the BOE in increasing asset purchases to support additional fiscal programs or spending by the Treasury.  Is there any circumstance under which you would consider those or those would be justified?  How closely are you willing to work with Treasury?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, so I \u2019m going to take your question literally.  And so if the idea is money -financed fiscal policy, that \u2019s not something that we would consider.  So that \u2014what I mean by that is , is really, you know, the , the central bank is really funding fiscal activities of the government fairly directly.  No, t hat\u2019s not something we do.  We have different jobs.  That separation between those jobs is absolutely critical in our system of government.  The \u2014you    know, the job of t axation and spending goes to people who have stood for election and been elected, and that \u2019s the way it should be.  There \u2014they have to be responsible to the electorate.  We have a specific, you know, job to do with, with  a specific set of tools to support maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability, help the payment system, supervise banks \u2014all the things we \u2019re assigned to do.  But we , we, we\u2019re not going to get into financing the government and, and\u2014by the way, when we buy government bonds, we don\u2019 t\u2014it doesn\u2019 t actually, as you probably know, doesn\u2019 t change the amount of government debt outstanding.  We issue a reserve to , to purchase a Treasury security, and that \u2019s just another form \u2014on the consolidated balance sheet of the federal government, that \u2019s just another obligation.  You change the\u2014you change the, you know, the nature of the obligation, but not the total quantity of debt that the government has when you do these asset purchase programs.  So I don\u2019 t know exactly what you \u2019re referring to.  But, you know, to\u2014again, to take your question literally about financing fiscal activity, it\u2019 s really not something that we think the central bank should do and, and not something we \u2019re looking at.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could follow up, there is a suggestion t hat you buy state and municipal securities directly in the same way that you buy mortgage -backed securities, providing, then, cash to municipalities that are cash- strapped at this point\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, we \u2019re doing that with the Municipal Liquidity  Facility now, so we\u2019re, we\u2019re  buying, you know, with, with  our own funds and with the CARES Act funds that , that we \u2019ve gotten through Congress and the Treasury.  We \u2019re buying municipal securities of up to three years.  So we \u2019re doing that now as part of a n emergency facility under s ection 13(3) , you know, which has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is all clearly laid out in the law.   So we \u2019re, we\u2019re actually doing that now.     But I , I see\u2014what that is , from our standpoint , is a rare thing that we do under s ection 13(3) when regular intermediation in the capital markets or in the banking system has broken down.  It \u2019s no longer working.  So we step in under 13(3) , and we provide liquidity.  What turns out to happen is , we an nounce a program, and the market starts working.  So we only actually have to do a backstop.  The amount of financing that \u2019s happened in the municipal markets this year is much higher than it was the prior year , and, and  we didn\u2019 t do it.  We did \u2014we \u2019ve done  a very small number of , of loans.  But just the fact that we \u2019re there as a backstop seems to \u2014seems to get the private parties to get back together and , and get the market working again.  So that \u2019s what 13(3) is for.  We\u2019re not \u2014that shouldn\u2019 t be a permanent  thing where we\u2019 re just another federal financing agency that \u2019s available to direct credit to \u2014you know, to very worthy borrowers.  That would be more along the lines of a GSE.  That \u2019s not what we do.  We \u2019re there to provide emergency liquidity when intermediation has broken down and then to pull back on that when\u2014you know , when \u2014as the markets normalize, we pull back and we put those tools away, as we did after the G lobal F inancial C risis and as we will here when the time comes.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you very much.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: .

While economic activity has rebounded, the pace of improvement has slowed, with strong household spending on goods but ongoing weakness in sectors that require close gathering.The housing sector has fully recovered with the help of low mortgage interest rates, and business investment has also improved. However, overall economic activity remains below pre-pandemic levels, and the future path is highly uncertain. While half of the jobs lost in March and April have been regained, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed, and the unemployment rate remains elevated at 7.9 percent as of September. The economic downturn has disproportionately affected certain groups, such as lower-wage workers, women, and minorities, creating great uncertainty about the future.The pandemic has had a significant impact on inflation, with consumer prices picking up over the summer but remaining soft in sectors most affected by the pandemic. Inflation remains below the 2 percent objective, and the uncertain economic outlook depends on efforts to control the virus.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) aims to achieve maximum employment and maintain inflation expectations at 2 percent. They will maintain an accommodative monetary policy until these goals are met, including keeping interest rates low and continuing to increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These asset purchases are intended to support market functioning, foster accommodative financial conditions, and provide substantial support to the economy.The Federal Reserve will continue to assess how ongoing asset purchases can support employment, price stability, market functioning, and financial stability. They have taken extensive actions to support credit flow for households, businesses, and governments, emphasizing the importance of preserving credit flow for economic recovery.Many borrowers are benefiting from the programs, but for others, getting a difficult-to-repay loan may not be the solution. In such cases, direct fiscal support may be necessary, as elected officials have the power to make decisions about where collective resources should be directed. The fiscal policy actions taken so far have made a critical difference, but the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes. It will take time and continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to return to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity and employment. Additionally, starting in December, the Summary of Economic Projections will be released simultaneously with the FOMC statement, instead of three weeks later as part of the minutes.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will provide more information on forecasts, uncertainty, and risks during policy announcements, including new graphs showing the evolution of participants' assessments. These changes aim to highlight risk-management considerations for monetary policy and support a robust recovery from the current economic challenges.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Can you speak about the indicators suggesting a moderation in the pace of improvement, including in the labor market, and how they are correlated to the rise in COVID cases?\n'ANSWER': The pace of improvement in the economy has moderated since the record decline in activity in March and April and the subsequent bounceback in May and June. This is expected, as the outsized job gains and economic activity in those months were not sustainable. The recent rise in COVID cases poses downside risks to further economic growth. However, we continue to see gradual expansion.", "'QUESTION': Could you talk a little bit about where you think the stimulus package that is being debated in Congress is and how severe a threat that could be to the economy if it does not get passed, say, before January?\n'ANSWER': Congress is responsible for deciding the timing, size, and components of further fiscal support. The support provided by the CARES Act was crucial in supporting the recovery, and I believe additional support will be needed for both monetary and fiscal policy. The risks we face, such as the spread of the virus and the expiration of CARES Act benefits, can be addressed through more fiscal policy. However, it is not our place to dictate what Congress should do in terms of timing, size, or specifics.", "'QUESTION': Would the lack of fiscal support compel the Fed to provide additional accommodation, and are you and your colleagues being more vocal about the need for fiscal support because the capacity for monetary policy to support growth is diminished here, given the low level of short- and long-term rates?\n\n'ANSWER': The Fed will consider all external factors and use its tools to pursue its goals. It is important to have a broad set of policies from across the government, including healthcare policy to control the spread of the virus. Fiscal policy can replace lost incomes for those out of work, while the Fed can support financial stability and demand through interest rates and asset purchases. A stronger recovery is likely with more fiscal support, and there is discussion suggesting that it will happen.", "QUESTION: If the market is functioning better, why haven't you reduced quantitative easing (QE)? What good would additional QE do for the broader economy given low interest rates?\nANSWER: Our asset purchases serve both financial market function and support for economic activity. We haven't reduced purchases because they still provide strong support to economic activity and sustain gains in financial stability. The current program is delivering the right amount of accommodation and support, but we can adjust parameters if needed.", "QUESTION: What is the risk of lower productivity, weaker labor force attachment, slower growth, and a cycle of lower real interest rates? Why isn't the Federal Reserve having a more explicit dialogue with Congress about fiscal support to avoid this outcome?\n\nANSWER: The risk is that extended periods of unemployment can lead to a loss of labor force attachment and skills, which hampers economic recovery. The Federal Reserve has been vocal about these risks and has taken strong and urgent measures to address them. The economic recovery has exceeded expectations so far, but there is still a long way to go. The Fed will continue to communicate and take actions to minimize the threat of long-term damage to the economy.", "'QUESTION': What is the current status of the facilities and are there any plans to extend them?\n'ANSWER': The facilities have generally served their purposes well, supporting the flow of credit and acting as backstops to private markets. The decision to extend them is currently being considered, with no decisions made yet. The decision will be made jointly with the Treasury Department.", "'QUESTION': Is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo?\n'ANSWER': No, the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to using its powerful tools to support the economy for as long as needed. They believe there is more that can be done and that the measures taken so far have provided strong support. However, fiscal policy is also essential in this situation, and healthcare policy is needed as well. The spread of the disease in Europe is a concern and could weigh on economic activity.", "'QUESTION': Do you feel like those who are crafting fiscal policy are listening to you and have a firm grasp of what you're saying about how it might affect the economy?\n\n'ANSWER': Our main focus is on doing our job and using the tools Congress has given us. It helps to have the whole government working on these things, and I think there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who see a need for further fiscal action and understand why that might be the case.", "'QUESTION': What would cause the Federal Reserve to shift more of its asset purchases towards long-term securities and Treasuries and change the amount of spending there?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve has the flexibility to adjust the composition, duration, size, and life cycle of its asset purchase program to provide more accommodation if necessary. Currently, they are satisfied with the level of accommodation, but they may decide to do more in the future based on the facts and circumstances. The recent meeting involved analyzing different parameters and having a productive discussion on how to approach them.", "'QUESTION': What are the Federal Reserve's plans regarding climate change and joining the network for greening the financial system?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve acknowledges the importance of accounting for climate change risks in financial regulation. They are actively working with central bank colleagues and monitoring other countries' actions. While they haven't formally joined the network, they participate in working groups and conduct research to understand and incorporate these risks into their supervision and overall financial system framework.", "'QUESTION': Have you gotten a commitment from Secretary Mnuchin to extend the 13(3) facilities if you decide it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary, and are you concerned what a lame-duck Trump Administration might do in that regard?

Has the Fed had any discussions about responding to that?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is reluctant to comment on the election directly, but will continue to do its job of supporting the economy. Discussions at the Fed meetings include the economy, markets, risks, and policy responses, but the election is not a central focus.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain why the minimum loan size under the Main Street facility was reduced and why it was done now instead of earlier?\n\n'ANSWER': There has been very little demand for loans below $1 million, partly due to the fee structure and the work required by banks to underwrite the credit. However, there were repeated requests to reduce the minimum to $100,000. We redesigned the program by changing the fee structure to incentivize lower loan sizes. We want qualifying businesses to be able to borrow and will assess the demand. Setting up these facilities takes time, and it's better to start and make changes later.", "'QUESTION': Do you think there is more that can be done with another type of program or redesign to assist small businesses and state and local governments?\n'ANSWER': The larger corporate lending program has been successful without making a single loan. The state and local government program has restored market function. The funding market programs have been successful. Reaching small and medium-sized businesses through the banking system is challenging, but grant programs like PPP have been effective. Demand for loans is low due to low activity levels. The Main Street program is a bigger challenge, but efforts are being made to reach more companies.", "'QUESTION': Is there any circumstance under which you would consider buying state and municipal securities directly or increasing asset purchases to support fiscal programs?\n'ANSWER': Money-financed fiscal policy, where the central bank funds government activities directly, is not something the Federal Reserve would consider. The separation between the central bank's job and fiscal activities is critical in our system of government. The responsibility for taxation and spending lies with elected officials, while the Fed's role is to support employment, stable prices, financial stability, and the payment system. The purchase of government bonds does not change the total quantity of government debt.", "QUESTION: Is there a suggestion to buy state and municipal securities directly to provide cash to cash-strapped municipalities?\n\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve is currently buying municipal securities through the Municipal Liquidity Facility using their own funds and funds from the CARES Act. This is done as an emergency measure under section 13(3) when regular intermediation in the capital markets or banking system has broken down. The goal is to provide liquidity and act as a backstop to get the market working again, not to become a permanent federal financing agency.", "'QUESTION': Thank you very much.\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell expresses gratitude for the reporter's comment."]}
