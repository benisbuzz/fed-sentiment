Hi, thank you.  So there\u2019s been this pretty consistent ref erence to expectations of above- trend growth over the last few months.  Now we\u2019re seeing growt h downgraded in the context of v ery explicit references to international and external c onditions:  weak export growth, oil  dragging down inflation, and your   own comments now on the dollar.  S o my question is, doesn\u2019t thi s indicate that the Fed\u2019s facing a tougher time\u2014you know, kind of going it alone, decoupling from the rest of the world\u2014than perhaps you expected last fall wh en this first started to be an  issue\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, it looks like, from incoming data pertaini ng to the first quarter, that real GDP growth has decline d somewhat below where it was f or the last several quarters of last year.  And that\u2019s really why t he Committee indicated that growth has moderated somewhat.  There has been a slight downgrad ing of estimates of growth for this year.  You mentioned the dollar.  We noted that export gr owth has weakened.  Probably th e strong dollar is one reason for that. On the other hand, the strength of  the dollar also, in part, re flects the strength of the U.S. economy.  The strength of the dolla r is also one factor that, a s I noted, is holding down import prices and, at least on a transit ory basis at this point, pushi ng inflation down.  So, we are taking account of international developm ents, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in making the forecast we have here. Nevertheless, it is important t o recognize that this is not a w eak forecast.  Taking everything into account, we continue to project above-trend gro wth.  We continue to project improvement in the labor market by the end of 2015.  The centra l tendency of the participants is, they\u2019re looking for an unemploym ent rate that will be down to 5 .0 to 5.2, which is consistent with their estimates of its l onger-run normal value.  So, we do  see considerable underlying strength in the U.S. econom y.  And, in spite of what looks like  a weaker first quarter, we are projecting good performance for the economy\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Marty Cruts inger, Associated Press.  The po licy statement today talks about one of the prere quisites you\u2019ll need to start  raising rates is to be \u201creasonably   confident\u201d that inflation\u2014your i nflation target\u2014will be met at 2 percent, but that is coming out at a time when you\u2019ve lowere d your forecast on inflation, what\u2014 which I would think would make you less confident about it .  What is it go ing to take to make you \u201creasonably confident\u201d about inflation\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, I don\u2019t have a  mechanical answer for you.  T here is no single thing where I\u2019d say, \u201cWe must s ee such-and-such  in order to ach ieve that level of confidence.\u201d  We will be looking at a wi de array of data. Now, we\u2019ve said that we also wan t to see continued improvement in the labor market.  And a stronger labor market wit h less labor market slack is one  factor that would tend to, certainly for me, increase my con fidence that as slack diminish es, that inflation will move up over time.  Other things I will be looking at\u2014of course, the in flation data, but as we said, we expect inflation to remain quite low because of the depressing influence of energy price declines and the dollar.  But we will be looking at the inflation data c arefully to see if w e can interpret, for example, low levels of inflati on\u2014if we see that, which we expec t, as reflecting those influences.  We will be looking at wage growth.  We have not seen wage growt h pick up.  We may not see wage growth pick up, I woul dn\u2019t say either that that is  a precondition to raising rates.  But if we did see wage growth pi ck up, that would be at least a  symptom that inflation would likely move up over time. We\u2019ll be watching inflation expe ctations.  Survey measures have  been stable; I expect that to continue, but we will be  watching it carefully.  And ma rket-based measures of inflation compensation have fallen.  They\u2019re low.  If they were to move u p over time, that would probably serve to increase my confidence.   But there are a wide range of t hings that we will be looking at , including further improvement in the labor market .  So there\u2019s no simple answer.  This is a judgment that the Committee will have to make\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jon H ilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, the famous dot plot that we always ta lk about showed that officials \u2019 expectations for where interest rates are going to end the y ear in 2015, \u201916, and \u201917 have come  down fairly notably.  I wonder if you could explain to us your analy sis of why those estimates ar e coming down.  And, specifically, is it a reflecti on of\u2014what\u2019s changed?  And is it a reflection of the changes in the Fed\u2019s economic forecast or a cha nge in the way the Fed is react ing to the economy that it sees\u2014its reaction function\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, it\u2019s always  hard to know exactly why each pa rticipant has written down the forecast they have, but certainly there are changes in  the assessments of the economy and forecasts for the economy tha t would point in the direction  of downward adjustment in the funds rate path.  For one thi ng, you do see meaningful downward  adjustment in the inflation forecast, certainly for this year. In addition, importantly, a numbe r of participants have marked down their estimates of the normal longer-run unemploymen t rate.  So that range has mov ed down noticeably from\u2014previously it was 5.2 to 5.5, and i t\u2019s now moved down to 5.0 to  5.2.  And downward revisions to the longer-run normal unemployment rate in a way suggests that participants are seeing more slack in the economy now than the y previously did.  So I think both of those things would point to downward revision in the funds rate path\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  The experience of some other central banks\u2014notably Japa n, Sweden also\u2014suggests that ti ghtening earl y when you\u2019re at   the zero lower bound can be a risky process\u2014the ri sks of tighte ning early can dramatically outweigh the risks of leaving thi ngs a little l onger.  I wonder  if you could comment on that international experience and expl ain how that\u2019s influencing the  debate in the FOMC at the moment\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, when an econom y is operating at the so-cal led zero lower bound, there\u2014it creates a situation w here there are asymmetric risks.  It is possible, if the economy proves stronger than is  expected, to r espond to that by  tightening policy.  If there are adverse shocks to demand that tend to push infla tion and econom ic performance in an adverse direction, it\u2019s not possible to l ower rates.  Of course, that\u2019s  a reason why, for a number of years, we engaged in active asset purch ase programs.  So there is a si tuation there of asymmetric risks, and it does point in the direct ion of waiting longer to raise r ates. But I would say that this is a n influence that we\u2014and a set of considerations\u2014that we have long been aware of and have been taking into account, so t hat it\u2019s not some thing that just comes into play now.  It is a reas on that we have held our rate s at 0 to \u00bc percent for, now, roughly six years.  So, we are see ing an economy that\u2019s growing  above trend, the labor market is improving.  I think some of the h eadwinds that have long been h olding the economy back are beginning to recede, which is a reason that the Committee wants  to be able to evaluate incoming data and consider when it may be  appropriate to finally raise r ates.  But that is a consideration we have long taken into account\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Liesma n, CNBC.  I don\u2019t hear, Chair Yelle n, any quantitative measures of what increasing conf idence is in inflation or headi ng back towards\u2014or a further improvement in the job market, which is unusual for a Fed that not too long ago was providing us metrics on unemployment about when it would move with rates.   Is it now policy to keep the   market guessing?  And is it thoug ht that you\u2019d have better poli cy and economic outcomes from less certainty about the path of  interest rates?  And a kind of  related question, if you will:  Could you see raising rates while the C ommittee still judges that the  risks are balanced?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, in terms of cer tainty and providing metrics,  we provided a metric or a threshold of 6\u00bd percent severa l years ago and told market participants and the public that we wouldn\u2019t consider it appropriate  to raise rates as long as the unemployment rate was higher than that level, as long as inflati on was well contained.  But our p olicy needs to be data dependent, and we need to respond to incom ing data and our assessment of i ncoming data in terms of where we think the economy is heading a nd how close we are to our obj ectives. And the markets\u2014so, can we provide  certainty?  Of course we can \u2019t provide certainty because we\u2019re not certain what th e data will look like and how the economy will evolve.  And to achieve our objectives, we need t o watch the data, continually reformulate our best guesses\u2014our forecasts of where the econo my is going\u2014and respond appropriate ly.  And we can\u2019t provide certainty and shouldn\u2019t provide c ertainty because economic deve lopments that will unfold are uncertain.  And what market par ticipants should be doing is loo king at incoming data just as we are and forming their expectati ons for where policy will be goi ng and should be going just exactly as we will be doing by a ttempting to understand economi c developments as they unfold.  And that\u2019s\u2014that is what we\u2019re t rying to say in this statement, that that\u2019s what we will be doing going forward.

And, I mean, certainly we could raise r ates in a situati on where the r isks are balanced.  We need to see, as we have said, we want to see fu rther improvement in the labo r market, and we want to feel reasonably confident that the economy is on a trajectory where we will achieve our 2 percent inflation objective\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Binya Appelbaum, New York Times .  There seems to be an awful lot riding on surveys of i nflation expectations, yet thos e surveys are an imprecise instrument; they don\u2019t seem partic ularly sensiti ve to the types  of changes in inflation that we have seen in recent years, they don\u2019t seem to differentiate bet ween, say, 1.5 and 2\u2014the expectations remain stable ev en through those changes.  Could y ou talk a little bit about why the FOMC has confidence that those me asures are accurate reflection s of where inflation is likely to go and whether, you know, the concerns  that you\u2019ve articulated about market-based measures at all correspond to concerns that  you may have about survey-based  measures\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, survey-base d measures aren\u2019t perfect.  And  the mean\u2014often the mean or even the median of those measures does not line up very well with actual inflation, so they seem to be biased.  Nev ertheless, they do seem to be us eful in predicting actual movements in inflation.  And because we think inflation expecta tions are a determinant of price setting, we need to be looking at the best data that we can, ev en if it\u2019s imperfect, in trying to gauge inflation expectations.  And so we do look at survey meas ures. Now, the fact that survey measur es are stable, even if they are  stable at levels consistent with inflation objectives that a central bank wants to achieve,  that\u2019s not a guarantee that inflation   will, over time, move to be consis tent with those expectations.   An example is Japan, I would give you, where for many years th e households and businesses ex pected positive inflation but there was a consistent undershoot .  So, this isn\u2019t a single met ric that is perf ect, but it\u2019s one of many things we\u2019d look at. We also look at measures of inf lation expectations based on mar ket differentials between nominal and real or TIPS yields .  They\u2019re also informative but can move around for reasons pertaining to liquidity in the Tr easury market and in the TIPS market, and also because of changing perceptions of inflati on risk.  So, they\u2019re not a pure  read, either.  And we want to look at both things and not take aw ay any simple morals\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Barnes, Fo x Business.  Chair Yellen, I wan ted to check in again with you on whether or not you see or  have any concerns about b ubbles out there in the economy, particularly the financi al markets\u2014debt and equity mar kets.  And I wanted to refer to your most recent Monetary Policy Report to Congress last month, in which you said \u201coverall equity valuations by some conventional measures are somewhat hi gher than their historical levels . . . valuation metrics in some sectors continued to app ear stretched rela tive to historical norms.\u201d  In the same report last  year, in July, the report spec ifically mentioned biotech and social media stocks as being \u201csubstantia lly\u201d\u2014let me see here\u2014\u201csubstant ially stretched.\u201d  Do you still feel that way and can you co mment on bubbles and particularly t hese sectors\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I don\u2019t want  to comment on those particula r sectors.  You know, as we said in the report, overall measures of equity valu ations are on the high side but not outside of historical ranges.  In s ome corporate debt markets, we do see evidence of unusually low spreads, and that\u2019s what was  referred to i n the report.   More broadly, we do try to assess pot ential threats to financia l stability.  And in addition to looking at asset valuations, w e also look at measures of cre dit growth, of the extent of leverage being used in the econom y and in the financial sector,  and the extent of maturity transformation.  And taking into account a broad range of metri cs that bear on financial stability, our overall assessment at this poi nt is that threats are modera te\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jen Liberto, Politico .  So, I want to switch ge ars a little bit and ask about some of the tension be tween the Fed and Congress late ly, with some lawmakers calling for more transparency and acc ountability measures.  And I wante d to ask to what degree that there might be room for the Fed to consider some of these measu res, like maybe a rules-based approach like the Taylor rule, or  some of these measures that w ould change up who has a voting seat on the FOMC.  To what degree does that make it more diffic ult to accomplish your mission\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, I believe the Federal Reserve is already one  of the most transparent central  banks of any around the  globe.  We provide an immense amount of information, both financial\u2014about  our balance sheet\u2014and our mon etary policy operations.  We have audited financial statem ents.  We publish our balance shee t every week.  If you want to know exactly what\u2019s in the SOM A portfolio, it\u2019s listed on the N ew York Fed website on a CUSIP-by-CUSIP basis.  I have pre ss conferences.  We issue minu tes.  We have, you know, statements that we release right  after meetings and transcripts  within five years.  So, if you put all that together, we are a transparent central bank. With respect to congressional cha nges that are under considerat ion that would politicize monetary policy by bring ing Congress in to make policy judgment s about, in real-time, on our monetary policy decisions.  C ongress itself decided in 1978 tha t that was a bad t hing to do, that it would lead to poor economic perfor mance, and they carved out th is one area of policy reviews,   of monetary policy decisionmaking, from GAO audits.  The GAO lo oks at everything else that goes on within the Fed.  And I thi nk that that is a central ban k best practice.  The global experience shows th at giving central banks independe nce to make monetary policy decisions that th ey think are in the be st interest of th e country and consistent with their mandates leads to lower inflation and more stable macroeconomic  outcomes.  So, I feel very strongly about that, but we are accountable to Congress.  Of co urse, we\u2019re ready to provide information that Congress needs t o evaluate the Fed\u2019s decisionm aking, in monetary policy and elsewhere. With respect to monetary policy rules, they can be useful, and I find them useful\u2014and long have\u2014as a kind of benchmark f or thinking about what might be the appropriate stance of policy.  But to chain a central ba nk to follow a simple mathema tical rule that fai ls to take account of many things that are very im portant in making monetary polic y\u2014for example, I was earlier asked about being against the z ero lower bound, which is an imp ortant special consideration\u2014that would be a very foolis h thing to do, and I oppose it. With respect to proposals havi ng to do with voting and the stru cture of the Fed that you mentioned, a lot of ideas have  been mentioned.  I would say, fo r my part, I think the Federal Reserve works well.  The syste m we have was put into place by C ongress decades ago.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a system that\u2019s br oken.  Of course, Congress can rev isit the decisions it\u2019s made about the structure of the Fed.  The re were good reasons for making t he decisions that were made about how to structure voting and other things, but\u2014and I don\u2019t think  the system is broken, I think it\u2019s working well.  So I don\u2019t see a need for changes.

But, remember, we hav e to put that in context:  There are a lot of things that affect t he U.S. outlook, and while that is  serving as a drag on economic growth, overall the Committee continues to see sufficient stren gth\u2014particularly in private spending\u2014that we are expecti ng above-trend growth, even so. With respect to our neighbors, we look very carefully at what\u2019s  happening in the global environment.  We realize that ou r own policies affect performan ce in the rest of the world, and that performance in other count ries has an influence on us, so we spend a good deal of time discussing global developments .  It is important for us to keep  our own house in order, to put in place the policy that\u2019s consistent with the objectives that Con gress has given us, and I think a strong U.S. economy certainly i s something that is good for oth er countries as well.

Many, many studies over decades and decades have showed that there are lags in the way monetary pol icy affects the economy, and, therefore, monetary policy does  have to be forward looking.  Th at\u2019s why we spend so much time preparing forecasts and discussi ng them, and we want to put in place a policy that will be appropriate for where the econom y is heading.  That\u2019s\u2014that is, you know, a reason that many of my colleagues\u2014most of my colleag ues\u2014are anticipating that it wi ll be appropriate to begin to tighten policy sometime this year .  In spite of the fact that t hey are projecting tha t inflation will be low, they\u2019re looking forwar d and they see that, by the end o f 2016 or 2017, with the labor market recovering, and assuming tha t inflation expectations rem ain stable and transitory influences no longer affecting inflation, they see inflation he ading back to our 2 percent objective.  So just as we don\u2019t wa nt to be premature in tighten ing policy and aborting a recovery that we have worked long and hard to proceed as far as it has, we also don\u2019t want to be behind the curve in beginning to  tighten given those lags\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Madame Chair, I\u2019d like to preface this by saying , I do believe you stand for accountability.

Good afternoon, Madame C hair.  The FOMC said last September that it will wait \u2018til after the first  rate hike to stop or to discontinue reinvesting proceeds of its MBS holdings and stop rolling over maturing Treasurie s.  What is the FOMC\u2019s current thinking about  how long after liftoff you should  wait to stop reinvestments and rollovers?  And, given the very lar ge amounts of Treasuries mat uring next year, would it make sense for the FOMC to vary the pace of runoff that it allows\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, we issued in Se ptember a set of normalizatio n principles, and, as you noted, the Committee indicated t hat we will eventually ceas e reinvestments or diminish the pace of reinvestments as a way of  gradually reducing the size o f our portfolio over time.  We said we would do that when econom ic conditions were appropriate  after we begin raising rates, because we want changes in the\u2014our target range for the federal  funds rate to be the main tool by which we shift the stance of monetary policy.  We\u2019ve not made any deci sion at this point   about how long it will be, once we b egin to raise rates, before  we reduce or cease reinvestment.  We will see how things go, and the Committee will revisit that and make a decision at a later time.  You also indicated that we have  a substantial quantity of Treas uries that will roll off our balance sheet over the next sev eral years.  That\u2019s true, and th at will\u2014I think, over the next two years, almost $800 billion will matu re\u2014and that they will be sh ort-term, obviously, Treasuries at that point, and that\u2019s a way in whi ch we anticipate diminishing  the size of our portfolio\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Can I follow  up, please?  Some people have sugg ested that you might need to manage those runoffs  a little more granularly, if  that\u2019s a word, perhaps pursue a different track for Treasur ies versus MBS or, you know, at give n quarters when you have very large amounts maturing, and there  might be a spike in long-term  interest rates, that maybe you would vary the rate of runoff.  I s that\u2014any consideration given  to that\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: That\u2019s something for which we\u2019ve made no plans, and I don\u2019t really have anything for you on that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Greg Robb from Mark etWatch.  We hear that productiv ity takes a long time before you can understand it, b ut it\u2019s been very low in th is cycle.  What does that mean for Fed policy\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I agree, it has been very low\u2014it\u2019s been di sappointingly low.  A positive aspect of what is fundamentally a disappointment is th at the labor market has improved more rapidly than might have been expected given the pace of ec onomic growth.  So the unemployment rate has come down m ore rapidly than I would have expected, and the labor market has improved more rapidly than I would have expected.  W e have written down our estimates of potential output .  In the long run, it is a disapp ointing factor about the ultimate   prospects for the U.S. econom y if it continues.  I would expect  it to pick up, and as you can see from the longer-run growth projections, most FOMC participants believe it will pick up above current levels.

Madame Chair,  one clarification, if I could, logistically, and t hen a question about Congress, a  follow-up.  First of all, you\u2019ve been asked this before, I just want t o see if we can clarify.  When you decide to start raising interest rates, could that decision ha ppen at a meeting in which you\u2014it\u2019 s not followed by a press conference?  And, on my congressi onal question, I would like to  get your reaction to your\u2014the treatment you received up on Capito l Hill the other day.  It di dn\u2019t look like a very pleasant experience, certainly in front of  the House, at least at moment s.  I wondered if you have concerns about that.  Has the relations hip between the Fed and Congress deteriorated to a point that it causes you concern?  What, if anything, can you do about it as well\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: .  So let me start w ith the press conferences.  I s aid this previously, and let me reiterate it, that ever y meeting that the Federal Open M arket Committee has is a live meeting at which we could make a decision.  Clearly, if we deci ded for the first time to raise the federal funds rate, it is som ething\u2014I think it would be appropr iate to answer questions and explain in more detail.  We ha ve long had the capacity to call a press conference after a meeting that we would hold by teleconfer ence\u2014by conference call\u2014and tha t\u2019s a capacity that was used on a number of occasions by my predecessor during the financial  crisis.  It is something that remains a capacity we have and w ould expect to use if it were n ecessary.   On the second part of your question , with respect to testimony,  you know, it\u2019s very important for the Federal Reser ve to be accountable to Congress .  We have a wide range of responsibilities, and it\u2019s entirely appropr iate for me to testi fy and be quizzed on a range of topics by members of Congress.

However, they did not rule out the possibility of an increase in subsequent meetings, emphasizing that the timing will depend on incoming information.The pace of employment growth has remained strong, with job gains averaging nearly 290,000 per month over the past three months. The unemployment rate decreased to 5.5 percent in February, showing improvement in the labor market, although there is still room for further progress as wage growth remains sluggish and the housing sector and export growth continue to be weak.The FOMC expects moderate GDP growth, supported by robust job gains and lower energy prices. Inflation has declined below the objective due to lower energy prices and declining import prices, but is expected to gradually move back towards the 2 percent objective as transitory factors dissipate and the labor market improves.The FOMC projects the unemployment rate to be around 5 to 5.2 percent by the end of the year, with a further decline expected in 2016 and 2017. Economic growth projections have been reduced, but still remain above estimates of the normal growth rate. Inflation is projected to be low this year, but is expected to rebound in the following years. The Committee reaffirms that the current federal funds rate range is appropriate, but has modified its forward guidance due to improving economic conditions.The FOMC considered it unlikely that economic conditions would warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate for the next couple of meetings. While an increase in the target range is still unlikely at the April meeting, it could be warranted at a later meeting depending on how the economy evolves.The projected rate for 2017 remains below most participants' longer-run value, despite the unemployment rate being slightly below its estimated longer-run value and inflation being close to the objective. Participants attribute the lower federal funds rate to the lingering effects of the financial crisis, which are expected to continue constraining spending and credit availability.\"The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\" \n\nSummary: The Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low until the labor market improves and inflation reaches and exceeds 2 percent. They will also continue to buy Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities until there is significant progress towards their employment and price stability goals.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Doesn't the downgraded growth and references to international conditions indicate that the Fed is facing a tougher time than expected?\n'ANSWER': The Fed acknowledges that real GDP growth has declined in the first quarter and there has been a slight downgrade in growth estimates for this year. The strong dollar has weakened export growth and pushed inflation down. However, the Fed still projects above-trend growth and improvement in the labor market, indicating underlying strength in the US economy.", "'QUESTION': What will it take for the FOMC to be \"reasonably confident\" about inflation?\n'ANSWER': There is no single thing that will determine our level of confidence. We will be looking at a wide array of data, including improvements in the labor market, inflation data, wage growth, inflation expectations, and market-based measures of inflation compensation. It is a judgment that the Committee will have to make.", "'QUESTION': Why have officials' expectations for interest rates in 2015, '16, and '17 come down?\n'ANSWER': Changes in assessments and forecasts for the economy, including downward adjustments in inflation forecasts and estimates of the normal longer-run unemployment rate, suggest more slack in the economy and point to a downward revision in the funds rate path.", "QUESTION: Can you comment on the international experience of tightening policy when at the zero lower bound and how it is influencing the debate in the FOMC?\n\nANSWER: When an economy is at the zero lower bound, there are asymmetric risks. If the economy is stronger than expected, policy can be tightened, but if there are adverse shocks, rates cannot be lowered. This is why we engaged in asset purchase programs. Waiting longer to raise rates is influenced by these risks, but it is a consideration we have long taken into account.", "'QUESTION': Is it now policy to keep the market guessing and have better policy and economic outcomes from less certainty about the path of interest rates? Could rates be raised while the risks are still balanced?\n'ANSWER': We can't provide certainty because economic developments are uncertain. Our policy needs to be data dependent and we need to respond to incoming data. Market participants should be looking at incoming data and forming their expectations for where policy will be going. We don't want to provide calendar-based guidance.", "'QUESTION': Can you raise rates when risks are balanced?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen asked for clarification on which risks were being referred to, indicating that the decision to raise rates would depend on the specific risks being balanced.", "'QUESTION': Could the Federal Reserve raise rates if risks are balanced?\n'ANSWER': Yes, the Federal Reserve could raise rates if risks are balanced. However, they also want to see further improvement in the labor market and be reasonably confident that the economy is on track to achieve their 2 percent inflation objective.", "'QUESTION': Why does the FOMC have confidence in surveys of inflation expectations and how do they compare to market-based measures?\n'ANSWER': Survey-based measures of inflation expectations may not align perfectly with actual inflation, but they are useful in predicting inflation movements. The FOMC believes that inflation expectations influence price setting, so they consider the best available data, even if imperfect. Market-based measures, such as nominal and real yields, are also informative but can be influenced by factors like liquidity and changing perceptions of inflation risk. Both types of measures are considered, without relying on any single metric.", "'QUESTION': Do you have any concerns about bubbles in the economy, particularly in the financial markets?\n'ANSWER': Overall equity valuations are somewhat higher than historical levels, but not outside of historical ranges. Unusually low spreads in some corporate debt markets were mentioned in the report. The assessment of potential threats to financial stability takes into account various metrics, and the overall assessment is that threats are moderate.", "'QUESTION': To what degree does tension between the Fed and Congress make it more difficult to accomplish the Fed's mission?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is already transparent, providing extensive information about its operations. Politicizing monetary policy by involving Congress in real-time decision-making would be detrimental. The Fed believes in the importance of central bank independence, as it leads to lower inflation and more stable outcomes. While open to providing information, the Fed opposes being bound by a simple mathematical rule and sees no need for changes to its structure.", "'QUESTION': Can you quantify the impact of the stronger dollar on the US economy and the obligation to help struggling countries?\n'ANSWER': I don't have a specific estimate, but I expect the stronger dollar to have a negative effect on net exports. However, overall, the Committee still expects above-trend growth due to strong private spending. We are aware of the global environment and the influence of our policies on other countries. A strong US economy benefits other countries as well, and we are committed to clear communication about monetary policy.", "'QUESTION': What about the risk of waiting too long to tighten monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': Monetary policy has lags in its effects on the economy, so it needs to be forward-looking. Despite projecting low inflation, my colleagues anticipate tightening policy this year, as they expect inflation to reach our 2% objective by the end of 2016 or 2017, assuming stable inflation expectations and no transitory influences. We don't want to be behind the curve in tightening policy.", "QUESTION: What has the Board found regarding the leak in the FOMC and will they respond to Congress?\nANSWER: The Committee takes the responsibility of safeguarding confidential information seriously and has procedures in place to address leaks. The Inspector General is currently reviewing the matter, and the Board welcomes the review. They have arranged to brief members of Congress and will cooperate in providing the information they seek.", "'QUESTION': Do you think that the culture at the banks is where it ought to be? And, if not, what is the Fed going to do to improve it, and when?\n'ANSWER': It has been disappointing to see brazen violations of the law in the banking sector. The Fed expects banks to comply with the law and have controls in place to ensure compliance. While changing organizational culture is not within the Fed's supervision, they will ensure banks have appropriate compliance regimes and will also examine compensation schemes that may incentivize risky behavior.", "QUESTION: Who are the members of the FOMC who struck down the investigation and does not revealing these facts go against transparency and accountability?\nANSWER: Chair Yellen did not directly answer the question about the members of the FOMC who struck down the investigation. However, not revealing these facts may contradict the transparency and accountability goals of the central bank.", "'QUESTION': Is there a sense in the regulatory community that financial crimes need to be punished more forcefully in order for there to be an actual deterrent against unethical behavior?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen dismisses allegations that the Federal Reserve dropped an investigation into financial crimes at the request of FOMC members. She does not provide details but denies the claim. When asked about enforcement, there is a perception that settlements are prioritized over punishment, leading to a lack of deterrence against unethical behavior.", "'QUESTION': Is there a sense in the regulatory community that financial crimes need to be punished more forcefully to deter unethical behavior?\n'ANSWER': The focus of banking regulators is on safety and soundness, aiming to eliminate unsafe and unsound practices as quickly as possible. Only the Justice Department can bring criminal action, but regulators can prohibit individuals responsible for misdeeds from participating in banking, which has been done and will continue to be done.", "'QUESTION': What is the FOMC's current thinking about how long after liftoff they should wait to stop reinvestments and rollovers, and should they vary the pace of runoff given the large amounts of Treasuries maturing next year?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC plans to gradually reduce the size of its portfolio over time by ceasing or diminishing the pace of reinvestments. They have not decided how long it will be after raising rates before reducing or ceasing reinvestment. They anticipate a substantial quantity of Treasuries maturing over the next two years, which will help diminish the size of their portfolio.", "'QUESTION': Can the Fed consider managing runoffs differently for Treasuries versus MBS or vary the rate of runoff during quarters with large amounts maturing to avoid spikes in long-term interest rates?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has not made any plans to manage runoffs differently or vary the rate of runoff in response to spikes in long-term interest rates.", "'QUESTION': What does the low productivity in this cycle mean for Fed policy?\n'ANSWER': The low productivity has been disappointing, but the labor market has improved more rapidly than expected. The Fed has adjusted its estimates of potential output and expects productivity to pick up in the long run. However, if low productivity persists, it could hinder living standards and real wage growth for ordinary households.", "'QUESTION': Could the decision to raise interest rates happen at a meeting without a press conference? Do you have concerns about the relationship between the Fed and Congress?\n'ANSWER': Every FOMC meeting is live and could result in a decision to raise rates. If it's the first rate hike, a press conference would be appropriate. The Fed has the capacity to hold a press conference by teleconference if necessary. It's important for the Fed to be accountable to Congress, and it's appropriate for me to testify and answer questions on any aspect of the Fed's behavior."]}
