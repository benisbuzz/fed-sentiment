In my opening remarks, I\u2019d like to briefly fi rst review today\u2019s polic y decision.  I\u2019ll then turn next to the Federal Open Market Committe e\u2019s quarterly economic pr ojections also being released today, and I\u2019ll place today\u2019s policy decision in the context of the Committee\u2019s projections and the Federal Re serve\u2019s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.  I\u2019ll then be glad to take your questions.  Throughout today\u2019s briefing, my goal will be to reflect the consensus of the Committee,  while taking note of the diversity of views as appropriate.  Of course, my remarks and in terpretations are my own responsibility.   In its policy statement rel eased earlier today, the Committee announced, first, that it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its security holdings, and, second, that it will complete its planned pur chases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the current quarter.  Of course, going forward, the Committee will regularly review the size and composition of it s securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those hol dings as needed to meet the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate.   The Committee made no change today in the ta rget range of the fede ral funds rate, which remains at 0 to \u00bc percent.  The Committee c ontinues to anticipate th at economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warra nt exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.   April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 2 of 26\u00a0\u00a0In conjunction with today\u2019s meeting, FOMC  participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and th e inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer run.  These pr ojections are conditional on ea ch participant\u2019s individual assessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee\u2019s objectives.  A table showing the projections has been distributed.  I\u2019m going to focus today on the central tendency projections, wh ich exclude the three highest a nd three lowest projections for each variable in each year.   I call your attention, first, to the Committee\u2019s longer-run projections, which represent participants\u2019 assessments of the rates to whic h economic growth, unemployment, and inflation will converge over time under appropriate monetary  policy and assuming no further shocks to the economy.  As the table shows, the longer-run projections for output growth have a central tendency of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, the same as in the January survey.  The longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of  5.2 to 5.6 percent, somewhat narrower than in January.  These figures may be interpreted as pa rticipants\u2019 current estimates of the economy\u2019s normal, or trend, rate of growth and its nor mal unemployment rate over the longer run, respectively.  The economy\u2019s longer-term rate  of growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors, such as the rate of growth of the labor force and the speed of technological change, and it should be noted that estimates of thes e rates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision over time.   The central tendency of the longer-run projecti on for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  In contrast to economic growth and unemployment, the l onger-run outlook for inflation is determined almost entirely by monetary policy; consequently, and given that th ese projections are based on the assumption that April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 3 of 26\u00a0\u00a0monetary policy is appropriate, these longer-run projections can be  interpreted as  indicating the inflation rate that Committee partic ipants judge to be most consis tent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate to foster maximum employment and stable  prices.  At 1.7 to 2.0 percent, the \u201cmandate-consistent\u201d rate of inflation is greater than  zero for a number of reasons.  Perhaps most important, attempting to maintain inflation at ze ro would increase the ri sk of experiencing an extended bout of deflation, or falling wages and pr ices, which in turn could lead employment to fall below its maximum sustainable level for a prot racted period.  Hence, a goal of literally zero inflation is not consistent with the Federal Re serve\u2019s dual mandate.  Indeed, most central banks around the world aim to set inflation above  zero, usually at ab out 2 percent.   I turn now to the Committee\u2019s economic outlook.  As indicated in today\u2019s policy statement, the Committee sees the economic reco very as proceeding at a moderate pace.  Household spending and investment in equipmen t and software continue to expand, supporting the recovery, but nonresidential inve stment is still weak and the hous ing sector is depressed.  In the labor market, overall conditions continue  to improve gradually.  For example, the unemployment rate moved down a bit further and payroll employm ent increased in March; new claims for unemployment insurance and indicators  of hiring plans are also consistent with continued improvement.   Looking ahead, Committee participants expect a moderate recovery to continue through 2011, with some acceleration of growth projecte d for 2012 and 2013.  Specifically, as the table shows, participants\u2019 projections for output grow th have a central tendency of 3.1 to 3.3 percent for this year, but rise to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2012 and about the same in 2013.  These projections are a little below those made by the Committee in  January; the markdown of growth in 2011 in particular reflects the somewhat slower-than-antici pated pace of growth in the first quarter.   April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 4 of 26\u00a0\u00a0The outlook for above-trend growth is associ ated with a projected reduction in the unemployment rate, which is seen as edging down to  8.4 to 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and then declining gradually to 6.8 to 7.2  percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, still well above the central tendency of participants\u2019 l onger-run projections for unemployment of 5.2 to 5.6 percent.  The projected decline in the unemplo yment rate is relatively slow largely because economic growth is projected to be only modestly  above the trend growth rate of the economy.   On the inflation front, commodity prices ha ve risen significantly recently, reflecting geopolitical developments and robust global demand, among other factors.  Increases in commodity prices are in turn boosting overall consumer inflation.  However, measures of underlying inflation, though having increased mode stly in recent months, remain subdued, and longer-term inflation expectati ons have remained stable.  Consequently, the Committee expects the effects on inflation of higher commodity pr ices to be transitory; as the increases in commodity prices moderate, inflat ion should decline toward its unde rlying level.  Specifically, participants\u2019 projections for infl ation have a central tendency of  2.1 to 2.8 percent for this year, noticeably higher than in the Ja nuary projections, before declin ing to 1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and then running at 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2013\u2014both about the same as in January.   The Committee\u2019s economic projections provi de important contex t for understanding today\u2019s policy action as well as the Committee\u2019 s general policy strategy.  Monetary policy affects output and inflation with a lag, so current policy actions must be taken with an eye to the likely future course of the economy.  Thus the Committee\u2019s projections of the economy, not just current conditions alone, must gui de its policy decisions.  The lags with which monetary policy affects the economy also imply that the Co mmittee must focus on meeting its mandated objectives over the medium term, which can be as  short as a year or two but may be longer, April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 5 of 26\u00a0\u00a0depending on how far the economy is initially  from conditions of maximum employment and price stability.   To foster maximum employment , the Committee sets policy to try to achieve sufficient economic growth to return the unemployment rate over time to its long-term normal level.  At 8.8 percent, the current unemployment  rate is elevated relative to that level, and progress toward more normal levels of unemployment seems likely to be slow.  The subs tantial ongoing slack in the labor market and the relativel y slow pace of improvement rema in important reasons that the Committee continues to maintain a highl y accommodative monetary policy.   In the medium term, the Committee also seek s to achieve a mandate -consistent inflation rate, which participants\u2019 longer-term  projections for inflation suggest  is 2 percent or a bit less.  Although the recent surge in commodity prices has le d inflation to pick up somewhat in the near term, the Committee continues to project inflation to return to mandate-consistent levels in the medium term, as I have discussed.  Consequentl y, the short-term increase in inflation has not prompted the Committee to tighten policy at this juncture.  Impor tantly, however, the Committee\u2019s outlook for inflation is  predicated on longer-term in flation expectations remaining stable; if households and firms continue to expe ct inflation to return to a mandate-consistent level in the medium term, then increased comm odity prices are unlikel y to induce significant second-round effects, in which inflation takes hold in noncommodity prices and in nominal wages.  Thus, besides monitoring inflation it self, the Committee will pay close attention to inflation expectations and to possible indications of second-round effects.   In providing extraordinary monetary policy a ccommodation in the aftermath of the crisis, the Committee has not only reduced its target for th e federal funds rate to a very low level, but has also expanded the Federal Reserve\u2019s balan ce sheet substantially.  The Committee at this April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 6 of 26\u00a0\u00a0meeting continued its ongoing discussion of  the available tools for removing policy accommodation, at such time as that should become appropriate.  The Committee remains confident that it has the tools th at it needs to tighten monetary policy when it is determined that economic conditions warrant such a step.  And in choosing the time to begin policy normalization as well as the pace of that normaliza tion, we will carefully consider both parts of our dual mandate.   Thank you again, and I\u2019d be glad  to take your questions.   QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, tomorrow we\u2019re going to get a pretty weak first-quarter GDP number.  Your own projections  for the year have been downgraded in this meeting.  How\u2014first of all, what do you see as the causes of the weak growth to start the year, even with monetary easing, even with payr oll tax cuts?  And what\u2019s behi nd this weaker forecast for 2011 GDP?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: You\u2019re correct.  We haven\u2019t seen the GDP number yet.  But we, like most private-sector forecasters, are e xpecting a relatively weak  number for the first quarter, maybe something a little und er 2 percent.  Most of the f actors that account for the slower growth in the first quarter appear to us to be tr ansitory.  They include things like, for example, lower defense spending than was anticipated, wh ich will presumably be made up in a later quarter; weaker exports\u2014and given the growth in the global economy, we expect to see that pick up again; and other factors like w eather and so on.  Now, there are some factors there that may have a longer-term implication.  For example, c onstruction, both residential and nonresidential, was very weak in the first quarter, and that ma y have some implications going forward.  So I would say that, roughly, that most of the sl owdown in the first quarter is viewed by the Committee as being transitory.  Th at being said, we\u2019ve taken our forecast down just a bit, taking April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 7 of 26\u00a0\u00a0into account factors like\u2014like w eaker construction and possibly ju st a bit less momentum in the economy.   QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, given what you know about the pace of the economy now, what is your best guess for how soon the Fed ne eds to begin to withdraw its extraordinary stimulus for the economy?  And could you also say what is your working definition of what \u201cextended period\u201d means from the purposes of the Fed statement?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: You\u2019re correct.

We\u2019ll be looking very carefu lly, first, to see if th at recovery is, indeed, sustainable, as we believe it is .  And we\u2019ll also be looking very  closely at the labor market.  We\u2019ve seen improvement in the labor market in the first quarter relative to the latter part of last year, but we\u2019d like to see continued improve ment\u2014more job creation going forward.  At the same time, we\u2019re also looking very carefully at in flation, the other part of our mandate.  As I\u2019ve noted, inflation\u2014headline inflati on\u2014is at least temporarily hi gher, being driven by gasoline prices and some other commodity prices.  Our expectation is that \u2014that inflation will come down towards a more normal level.  But we\u2019ll be watc hing that carefully and also watching inflation expectations, which\u2014you know, which are important that they remain well anchored if we\u2019re going to see inflation remain under good control.  So to answ er your question, I don\u2019t know exactly how long it will be before a tightening process begins.  It \u2019s going to depend obviously on the outlook and on those criteria which I s uggested.  The \u201cextended period\u201d language is conditioned on exactly those same points:  \u201cExt ended period\u201d is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expect ations.  Once those conditions are violated, or are we moving away from those conditions, that will be the time that we need to begin to tighten.  \u201cExtended period\u201d suggests that there would be  a couple of meetings probably before\u2014before April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 8 of 26\u00a0\u00a0action.

QUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, first, thanks  for doing this.  This is a tremendous development.  There are critics who say that Fe d policy has driven down the value of the dollar, and a lower value to the dollar reduces Americans\u2019 standard of living.

Let me just add to what he said, first, by saying that the Federal Reserve believes that a strong and stable dollar is both in American interest and in the interest of the global economy.  There ar e many factors that cause the dollar to move up and down over short periods of time.  But over the medium term, where our policy is aimed, we\u2019re doing two things.  First, we are trying to maintain lo w and stable inflation by our definition of price stability by maintaining the pur chasing value of the dollar, keeping inflation low.  That\u2019s obviously good for the dollar.  The second thing we\u2019re trying to accomplish is to get a stronger recovery and to achieve maximu m employment.  And, again, a strong economy, growing, with attracting foreign capi tal, is going to be good for the do llar.

One factor, for example, that has caused fluctuations that have been quite extreme during the crisis has been the safe-haven effect.  So, for example, during the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008, money flowed in to the Treasury ma rket and drove up the value of the dollar quite substantially, reflecting the fact that U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liqui d in the world.  And a lot of what you\u2019ve seen over th e last couple of years is just th e unwinding of that as the economy has strengthened and as uncertain ty has\u2014has been reduced.

And can you also comment or elaborate on the increase that we\u2019ve s een in the inflation forecasts that the Fed put out today?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Sure.  Thanks, J on.  So, first of all, gasoline prices obviously have risen quite significantly.  And we, of course, are watching that carefully, that higher gas prices are absolutely creating a great d eal of financial hardship  for a lot of people.  And gas, of course, is a necessity.  People need to  drive to get to work.  So it\u2019s obviously a very bad development to see gas prices rise so much.  Higher gas prices, higher oil prices also make economic developments less favorable.  On the one hand, obviously, the highe r gas prices add to inflation.  On the other hand, by draining purchas ing power from households, higher gas prices April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 10 of 26\u00a0\u00a0are also bad for the recovery.  They cause growth  to decline as well.  So it\u2019s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.  Now, our\u2014our in terpretation of the incr ease in gas prices is the economist\u2019s basic mantra of supply and demand.  On the one hand, we have a rapidly growing global economy.  Emerging market econo mies are growing very quickly, and their demand for commodities, including oil, is very, very strong.  Indeed, essentially all of the increase in the demand for oil in the last coupl e of years and the last decade has come from emerging market economies.  In the United St ates, our demand for oil\u2014our imports have actually been going down over time.  So the de mand is coming from a growing economy where we\u2019ve seen about a 25 percent increase in emer ging market output in the last\u2014since before the crisis.  And on the supply side, as everybody knows who watches television, we\u2019ve seen disruptions in the Middle East and North Afri ca, in Libya, and in other places that have constrained supply. That supply has not been made up, and that, in turn, has driven gas prices up quite significantly.  So, again, this is a very adve rse development.  It accounts in the short run for the increase in our\u2014pretty much almost all of the in crease in our inflation forecast, at least in the very near term.  There\u2019s not much the Federal Re serve can do about gas prices, per se, at least not without derailing growth entirely, which is ce rtainly not the right way to go.  After all, the Fed can\u2019t create more oil.  We don\u2019t control th e growth rates of emerging market economies.  What we can do is basically try to keep higher gas prices from passing into other prices and wages throughout the economy and creating a br oader inflation, which would be much more difficult to extinguish.  Again, our view is that, most likely\u2014of course, we don\u2019t know for sure, but we\u2019ll be watching carefully\u2014our vi ew is that gas prices will not c ontinue to rise at the recent pace, and as they stabilize or even  come down if the situation stab ilizes in the Middle East, that that will provide some relief on the inflation front.  But we\u2019ll have to watch it very carefully.   April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 11 of 26\u00a0\u00a0QUESTION.  Thank you.  Scott Lanman from  Bloomberg News.

Last August when we began to talk about another r ound of securities purchases, growth was very moderate.  And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to bring the unemployment rate down.  Since then, we have seen a reasonable amount of payroll creation, job creation.  And that picked up in th e most recent few months, together with the decline in the unemployment rate from, you know,  10 percent down to the current rate of 8.8 percent.  So the labor market is  improving gradually, as we say in our statement.  And we\u2019d just like to make sure that that is sustainable, and the l onger it goes on, the more confident we are.  And, again, it is encouraging to see the improveme nt that we\u2019ve seen in recent months.  That being said, the pace of improvement is still quite  slow, and we are digging ourselves out of a very, very deep hole.  We are still something like 7 million-plus jobs below where we were before the crisis.  And so, clea rly, the fact that we\u2019re moving in  the right direction, even though that\u2019s encouraging, doesn\u2019t mean that the labor ma rket is in good shape.  Obviously, it\u2019s not.  And we\u2019re going to have to, you know, continue to  watch and hope that we will get stronger and increasingly strong job creation going forward. QUESTION.

We are going to do that pretty much without tapering.  We\u2019re ju st going to let the purchas es end.  Our view is that\u2014based on past experience a nd based on our analysis\u2014is that  the end of the program is unlikely to have significant effects on financ ial markets or on the economy, the reason being that, first\u2014just a simple point that we hoped we have telegraphed today\u2014we hope we have communicated what we\u2019re planning to do.  And the markets have well anticipated this step.  And you would expect that policy steps which are well anticipated by the market would have relatively small effects because whatever effects you\u2019re going to have would have already been capitalized in the financial markets.  Secondly, we  subscribe generally to what we call here the stock view of the effects of securities purch ases, which\u2014by which I mean that what matters primarily for interest rates, stock prices, and so  on is not the pace of ongoing purchase, but rather the size of the portfolio that the Federal Reserv e holds.  And so, when we complete the program, as you noted, we are going to continue to reinvest  maturing securities, bo th Treasuries and MBS, and so the amount of securities th at we hold will remain approxima tely constant.  Therefore, we shouldn\u2019t expect any major effect of that.  Put another way, the amount of ease, monetary policy easing, should essentially remain constant go ing forward from\u2014from Ju ne.  At some point, presumably early in our exit process, we will, I suspect, based on conversations we\u2019ve been having around the FOMC table, it\u2019s very likely that an early step would be to stop reinvesting all or part of the securities whic h are coming\u2014which are maturing.  But take note that that step, although a relatively modest step, does const itute a policy tighteni ng because it would be lowering the size of our balance sh eet and, therefore, would be expected to essentially tighten financial conditions.

We have used forward guidance in our language to af fect expectations of po licy changes.  And, of course, as everyone knows, we have now been through two rounds of purchases of longer-term securities, which have seemed to have been effective in easing fi nancial conditions and, therefore, providing support for recovery and fo r employment.  Going forward, we\u2019ll have to continue to make judgments abou t whether additional steps are warranted.

But clearly it is the case that we have done extraordinary things in orde r to try to help this economy recover. QUESTION.  John Ydstie with NPR News.  Mr. Chairman, it\u2019s the view of a lot of economists that the second round of quantitative easing hasn\u2019t done much to help the economy.  What positive effects can you point to directly?  And if there are positive effects, can you really afford to end the program in June, with th e unemployment rate still around 9 percent?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Thank you.  Well, fi rst, I do believe th at the second round of securities purchases was effective.  We saw that first in the financial markets.  The way monetary policy always works is by easing financial conditions.  And we saw increases in stock prices.  We saw reduced spreads in credit market s.  We saw reduced volatility.  We saw all the changes in financial markets and quite significa nt changes that one w ould expect if one was doing an ordinary easing of policy via a reduced federal funds rate.  And, indeed, we saw the same types of financial market responses in the first round, which began in March of 2009.  So we were able to get the financial easing that we were trying to get.  We did get very significant easing from this program.  You would expect , based on decades of experience, that easing financial conditions would lead to better economic conditions, and I think the evidence is consistent with that as well.  As I discussed in more detail in my Humphrey\u2013Hawkins testimony in the beginning of March, between late August wh en I first indicated th at the Federal Reserve was seriously considering this additional step an d early this year, not only the Federal Reserve but many outside forecasters upgra ded their forecasts.  And we saw\u2014we saw strengthening labor market conditions, higher rates of payroll job creation, et cetera.  Now, the conclusion, therefore, that the second round of securiti es purchases was ineffective c ould only be validated if one thought that this\u2014this step was a panacea, that it was going to solve all the problems and return April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 16 of 26\u00a0\u00a0us to full employment overnight.  We were very  clear from the beginni ng that, while we thought this was an important step and th at it was at an important time wh en we were all worried about a double dip and we were worried about deflation, we were very clear that this was not going to be a panacea, that it was only going to turn the ec onomy in the right direction.  And, indeed, we published some analytics which gave job crea tion numbers which were  significant but not\u2014certainly not enough to completely solve the enor mous jobs problem that we have.  So, again, relative to what we expected, an ticipated, I think the program wa s successful.  Why not do more?  Again, this was similar to the question I received  earlier.  The tradeoffs are getting\u2014are getting less attractive at this point.  Inflation has gotten hi gher.  Inflation expectat ions are a bit higher.  It\u2019s not clear that we can get substantial im provements in payrolls without some additional inflation risk.  And, in my view , if we\u2019re going to have success in creating a long-run sustainable recovery with lots of job growth, we\u2019ve got to ke ep inflation under control.   So we\u2019ve got to look at both of those\u2014both parts of the ma ndate as we\u2014as we choose policy.   QUESTION.  I\u2019m Luca Di Leo from Dow J ones.  Mr. Chairman, what\u2019s the right response if high oil prices persist?  On the one hand, they push inflation higher.  On the other, they can hurt the economy by hitting spending.

Our anticipation is that oil prices will stabilize or tend to come down.  If that happens or if at least oil prices don\u2019t increase si gnificantly further, then inflation will\u2014will come down, and we\u2019ll have\u2014we\u2019ll be close to our medium-term objectives.  So, as we look at oil prices, you know, as you point out, we have to look at both sides of the situati on.

You\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about the problem of long-term unemployment.   Can the Fed effectively reduce long-term unemployment?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, first, you \u2019re absolutely right.  Long-term unemployment in the current economy is\u2014is the wors t\u2014really the worst it\u2019s been in the postwar period.  Currently something like 45 percent of all the unemployed have been unemployed for six months or longer.  And we know the conseque nces of that can be very distressing because people who are out of work for a long time, thei r skills tend to atrophy\u2014th ey lose contacts with the labor market, with other people working, the networks that they have built up.  And we saw in the European experience, for example, in  the \u201980s and \u201990s, th at a period of high unemployment with very long-te rm unemployment spells can act ually lead unemployment to remain very high for a protracted period.  So it is  a very significant con cern.  And it\u2019s one of the reasons that\u2014that the Federal Reserve has been  so aggressive.  By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who\u2019ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoi d the longer-term consequences of  people being out of work for months at a time.  So that\u2019s part  of the reason that we have been as aggressive as we have.  As the situation drags on and as the long-term unempl oyed lose skills and lose contact with the labor April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 18 of 26\u00a0\u00a0market or perhaps just become discouraged and stop looking for work, then it becomes really out of the scope of monetary policy.  At that poi nt, job training, educati on, and other types of interventions would probably be more  effective than monetary policy. QUESTION.  Could I just follow up?

If  Congress and the Administration are able to make credible commitments to cut ting programs or in any way changing the fiscal profile going forward over a long period of time, that is the most constructive way to address what is, in fact, a long-run problem.

One of the things that we include is the views of the participants on the amount of uncertainty there is in the fore cast going forward.  And I think I can say, without too much fear of giving away the secret, that FOMC partic ipants do see quite a bit of uncertainty in the world going forward, and a lot of that un certainty is coming from global factors.  I\u2019ve already talked  about Middle Eastern\u2013North Africa developments which have affected oil prices, conditions in emerging mark ets which have affected commodity prices and other things.  The European situation continues,  and we\u2019re watching that very carefully.  Now, obviously, you asked about Japan.  Let me first sa y, you know, that I\u2019ve had a lot of contact with my Japanese counterparts, central bank Governor  Shirakawa and other people in the Japanese government.  We collaborated with them on th e foreign exchange in tervention, as you know.  And we are very admiring of the courage of the Japanese people in respondi ng to these situations and of\u2014the central bank of Japan has done, I th ink, a good job in providing liquidity and helping to stabilize financial markets in what are very, very significant disturbanc es to the economy.  The April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 21 of 26\u00a0\u00a0implications for Japan have been discussed at  some length, and I think Governor Shirakawa recently talked about them.  In the near term, th ere will probably be a decline in Japanese output, reflecting the destruction, reflecting electricity pr oblems, et cetera.  We believe that will be relatively temporary and that the eco nomy will start to come back.  But, of course, this is a major blow, and it will take a lot of effort on the part of the Japanese people to restore the economy and to recover from the damage that was done by the \u2014by the tragedy.  For the United States, we are looking at this very carefully.  Thus far, the ma in impact of the Japanese situation on the U.S. economy has been through supply chains.  We\u2019ve noted some automobile companies, for example, that have had difficulty getting certain  components which are ma nufactured mostly or entirely in Japan.  And that ha s led a number of companies to announce that they would restrain production for a time.  So there may be some moderate effect on\u2014on the U.S. economy.  But we expect it to be moderate and to be temporary.

But irrespective of inflationary expectations or psychology, isn\u2019t it possible that the Fed\u2019s policies could be providing the monetary tinde r for inflation the longer they continue?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, we\u2014we view our  monetary policies as being not that different from ordinary monetary policy.  I mean, it\u2019s true that we\u2019v e used some different tools.  But those tools are operating through financia l conditions, and we have a lot of experience understanding how financial conditi ons\u2014changes in interest rates,  changes in stock prices, and so on\u2014how they affect the economy, including both growth and inflation.  So we are monitoring April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 22 of 26\u00a0\u00a0the state of the economy, watching the evolving outlook.  And our intention, as is always the case, is to tighten policy at the appropriate time to ensure that inflation remains well controlled, that we meet that part of our mandate, while doing the best we can to ensure also that we have a stable economy and a sustainable recovery in the labor market.  So the problem is the same one that central banks always face, which is choos ing the appropriate path of tightening at the appropriate stage of the recover y.  It\u2019s difficult to get it exac tly right, but we have a lot of experience in terms of what are the consider ations and the economics that underlie those decisions.  So we anticipate that we will tighten at the right time and that we will thereby allow the recovery to continue and a llow the economy to return to a mo re normal configuration, at the same time keeping inflation low and stable.

Well, the Federal Reserve has been looking for ways to increase its transparen cy now for many years, and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.  It used to be that  the mystique of central banki ng was all about not letting anybody know what you were doing.  As recently as 1994, th e Federal Reserve didn\u2019t  even tell the public when it changed the target for the federal funds rate.  Since then, we have taken a number of steps.  A statement, which includes a vote.  We have\u2014we produce very detailed minutes which are released only three weeks af ter the meeting, which is essen tially a production lag.  We now provide quarterly projections, including long-run objectives as well as near-term outlook.  We have substantial means of communicating throu gh speeches, testimony, and the like.  And so we have become, I think, a very\u2014a very transparen t central bank.  That being said, we had a subcommittee headed by the Vice Chair of the Board, Janet Yellen, looking for yet additional steps to take to provide additional transparen cy and accountability.  And the press conference was\u2014came right to the top, because this is an area, first of all, where global central bank practice includes now\u2014many central banks do use press conferences, and we have some experience with them.  And, secondly, it does provide a chance for th e Chairman, in this case, to provide some additional color and context for both\u2014in this cas e both the meeting and the projections that are April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 24 of 26\u00a0\u00a0being made by the Committee.  So we thought it wa s a natural next step.  We\u2019re not done.  We\u2019re continuing to look for additional things that we can do to be more transparent and more accountable.  But we think this is the right way to go.

Now, of course, the Fed di dn\u2019t do this for a long time.

Mr. Chairman, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart wrote a book looking at 800 years of financial history and discovered that, when you have a financial crisis, it takes a lot longer for the economy to recover.  Are people e xpecting too much from the Federal Reserve in terms of helping the economy recover?  And has that complicated your m onetary policymaking?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: .  Well, let me just sa y, first, that Ken Rogoff was a graduate school classmate of mine, so I\u2019ve known him for a long time.  I\u2019ve even played chess against him, which was a big mistake.  And I enjoye d that book very much.  I thought it was very informative.  And as you say, it makes a point that , as an historical ma tter, that recoveries following financial crises tend to be relativel y slow.  Now, what th e book didn\u2019t really do, though, was given a full explanation of why that\u2019s th e case.  Certainly, part of it has to do with April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 25 of 26\u00a0\u00a0the problems in credit markets, and my own re search when I was in academia focused a great deal on the effects of problems in credit markets on recoveries.  Other as pects would include the effects of credit problems on areas like housing a nd so on.  And we\u2019re seeing all that, of course, in our economy.  But that said, another possible e xplanation for the slow recovery from financial crises might be that policy responses were not adequate, that they\u2014tha t the recapitalization of the banking system, the restoration of credit flow s, and monetary and fiscal policies were not sufficient to get\u2014to get as quick  a recovery as might otherwise have been possible.  And so, you know, we haven\u2019t allowed that historical fact to dissuade us from doing all we can to support a strong recovery.  That being sa id, it is a relatively slow recovery, and you can identify reasons for that.  Credit factors are one.  Another very  important factor is that, you know, this was triggered by a bubble in the housing market, and the housing market remains very weak.  And under normal circumstances, construction, both re sidential and nonresiden tial, would be a big part of the recovery process.  And so there are a number of factors, and now we\u2019re seeing high oil prices and other things.  There are a numbe r of factors which are holding\u2014which are holding the recovery back.  So there are good reasons for why the recovery is  slower than we would like.  At the same time, it\u2019s very hard to blame the American public for being impatient.  Conditions are far from where they\u2014where we would lik e them to be.  The combination of high unemployment, high gas prices, a nd high foreclosure rates is a te rrible combination.  A lot of people are having a very tough time.  So I can certainly understand why people are impatient.  And I guess the only thing I can say is that, while the recovery proc ess looks likely to continue to be a relatively moderate one compared to the depth of the\u2014of the rece ssion, I do think that the pace will pick up over time.  And I am very conf ident that, in the long run, that the U.S. will return to being the most productive\u2014one of th e fastest growing and dynamic economies in the April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 26 of 26\u00a0\u00a0world.  And it hasn\u2019t lost any of  the basic characteristics that made it the preeminent economy in the world before the crisis, and I think we\u2019ll return to that status as we recover.

The target range of the federal funds rate remains unchanged at 0 to \u00c2\u00bc percent.The FOMC anticipates that economic conditions warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period, considering low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations. The Committee's longer-run projections show that the central tendency for output growth remains at 2.5 to 2.8 percent, while the central tendency for the unemployment rate narrows to 5.2 to 5.6 percent, indicating participants' current estimates of the economy's normal rate of growth and unemployment over the longer run.The longer-run projection for inflation is 1.7 to 2.0 percent, which is considered consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate. Maintaining zero inflation would increase the risk of deflation and is not in line with the dual mandate. The economic recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace, with household spending and investment expanding, but nonresidential investment and the housing sector remain weak. Overall, the labor market conditions are gradually improving.The FOMC expects the moderate recovery to continue through 2011, with some acceleration of growth projected for 2012 and 2013. Projections for output growth have decreased slightly for 2011 due to slower-than-anticipated growth in the first quarter, but are expected to rise in the following years.Participants' projections for inflation have increased for this year but are expected to decline in the following years, remaining consistent with previous projections. The Committee's policy decisions are guided by its projections of the economy and its objectives of maximum employment and price stability over the medium term.The FOMC has decided not to tighten policy despite the short-term increase in inflation, as long-term inflation expectations remain stable and increased commodity prices are unlikely to have significant effects on noncommodity prices and wages. The Committee will closely monitor inflation expectations and possible second-round effects.The Chairman acknowledges that the first-quarter GDP number will be weak and that their own projections for the year have been downgraded. He then asks about the causes of the weak growth despite monetary easing and payroll tax cuts, and the reasons behind the weaker forecast for 2011 GDP.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Given what you know about the pace of the economy now, what is your best guess for how soon the Fed needs to begin to withdraw its extraordinary stimulus for the economy? And could you also say what is your working definition of what \u00e2\u0080\u009cextended period\u00e2\u0080\u009d means from the purposes of the Fed statement?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman stated that the timing of when the Fed needs to withdraw its stimulus will depend on the Committee's assessment of the economy. He mentioned that the term \"extended period\" in the Fed statement refers to the medium term, which could be as short as a year or two but may be longer depending on the distance of the economy from maximum employment and price stability.", "QUESTION: How do you respond to the criticism that Fed policy has reduced Americans' standard of living by driving down the value of the dollar?\nANSWER: Chairman Bernanke states that the Fed's policies are aimed at promoting economic recovery and maintaining price stability. While the value of the dollar has declined, it is a result of various factors, including global economic conditions. The Fed's actions are not intended to harm Americans' standard of living.", "'QUESTION': How do you respond to the criticism that Fed policy has reduced Americans' standard of living by driving down the value of the dollar?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve believes that a strong and stable dollar is in the interest of both America and the global economy. Our policy aims to maintain low and stable inflation, which is good for the dollar, and to achieve maximum employment, which will attract foreign capital and strengthen the dollar in the medium term.", "'QUESTION': Can the Fed do anything about rising gasoline and food prices? Can you comment on the increase in inflation forecasts?\n'ANSWER': The Fed's primary focus is on maintaining low inflation and achieving maximum employment. While they acknowledge the impact of rising prices on Americans, they believe that their efforts to keep inflation low and create a strong economy will ultimately benefit the dollar in the medium term. They did not provide specific actions they would take regarding rising prices.", "'QUESTION': Can the Fed do anything about rising gas and food prices? What is the cause of the increase in gas prices?\n'ANSWER': The Fed cannot directly control gas prices or the growth rates of emerging market economies. However, they can try to prevent higher gas prices from causing broader inflation. The increase in gas prices is due to a rapidly growing global economy, particularly in emerging market economies, and supply disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa.", "'QUESTION': Is there anything that the Federal Reserve can do to prevent the public from assuming that a period of higher inflation is on its way?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve can try to keep higher gas prices from passing into other prices and wages throughout the economy, which would create a broader inflation. They believe that gas prices will stabilize or even come down, providing some relief on the inflation front.", "'QUESTION': What will be the impact on the economic recovery, job creation, and rates on mortgages and other loans when the Fed ends its $600 billion bond-buying program? Will the Fed continue to allow for reinvestments?\n'ANSWER': The impact of ending the bond-buying program on the economy, job creation, and loan rates is uncertain. The Fed will continue to reinvest the proceeds from its securities holdings to maintain accommodative financial conditions.", "QUESTION: Do you think it will be several months away?\nANSWER: We will base the decision on when to stop reinvesting maturing securities on the evolving outlook, taking into consideration the sustainability of the recovery and the inflation situation. It is likely that this step will be taken early in our exit process, but the timing will depend on the circumstances.", "'QUESTION': Is it in the Fed's power to reduce the rate of unemployment more quickly? How would you do that, and why are you not doing it?\n'ANSWER': It depends on the outlook and the Committee will have to make a judgment. The Fed could potentially reduce unemployment more quickly by implementing further monetary policy easing, but the decision to do so would depend on the evolving outlook and the sustainability of the recovery.", "'QUESTION': What positive effects can you point to directly from the second round of quantitative easing? Can you afford to end the program in June with the unemployment rate still around 9 percent?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary measures to stabilize and recover the economy, including creating new ways to ease monetary policy and purchasing longer-term securities. While we have to consider both growth and inflation, ending the program in June with a high unemployment rate would have significant costs in terms of future employment loss.", "'QUESTION': What is the right response if high oil prices persist and how should the Federal Reserve handle the situation?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman believes that high oil prices can push inflation higher and hurt the economy by reducing spending. The best strategy in this situation is to carefully monitor the impact of oil prices on inflation and economic growth, and make policy decisions that balance both concerns.", "'QUESTION': Can the Fed effectively reduce long-term unemployment?\n'ANSWER': The Fed can help reduce long-term unemployment by creating a sustainable recovery with job growth. However, the tradeoffs are becoming less attractive as inflation has increased. The Fed needs to keep inflation under control while also focusing on job growth.", "'QUESTION': Can the Fed effectively reduce long-term unemployment?\n'ANSWER': Long-term unemployment is a significant concern, with around 45% of the unemployed being out of work for six months or longer. The Fed's aggressive actions aim to bring back these individuals to avoid the longer-term consequences. However, if the situation persists and the long-term unemployed lose skills and become discouraged, job training and other interventions may be more effective than monetary policy.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that the United States is going to lose its triple-A credit rating?\n'ANSWER': We don't have any tools for targeting long-term unemployment specifically. We can just try to make the labor market work better, broadly speaking.", "'QUESTION': Is there anything the Fed can do or should do if there are large budget cuts sometime in the next 18 months?\n'ANSWER': The Fed can't directly target long-term unemployment, but it can try to improve the labor market overall. S&P's negative watch on US debt is not surprising, as the US has a serious long-term fiscal problem. It is important for Congress and the Administration to address this problem quickly and effectively. If there are large budget cuts, the Fed may need to ease its policy to counteract the potential negative impact on the economy.", "QUESTION: What is the latest assessment on the uncertainties and downside risks in the global economy, such as the tragedy in Japan, crisis in Europe, and uprising in the Middle East? What would be the impact of those on the US and world economy?\n\nANSWER: The Chairman emphasizes that addressing the long-term fiscal deficit is a top priority. The cuts made so far do not seem to have significant consequences for short-term economic activity. If Congress and the Administration make credible commitments to long-term fiscal changes, it would be the most constructive way to address the problem. The Federal Reserve would take into account any short-term consequences for growth in setting monetary policy.", "'QUESTION': Isn't it possible that the Fed's policies could be providing the monetary tinder for inflation the longer they continue?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is aware of the importance of keeping inflation expectations low and stable. While there is a possibility that the Fed's policies could contribute to inflation, they are constantly monitoring the situation and will adjust monetary policy accordingly to maintain their mandate.", "'QUESTION': If the dollar were to sink to a level that harms the US economy and global economy, would the Fed consider changing its monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': The Fed views its monetary policies as similar to ordinary monetary policy and believes that tightening policy at the appropriate time is necessary to control inflation. The decision to change monetary policy in response to a sinking dollar would depend on the evolving economic outlook and the goal of maintaining a stable economy and sustainable recovery in the labor market.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk a little bit about your decision to hold a news conference after a Fed meeting and how facing the media compares to facing Congress?\n'ANSWER': We view our monetary policies as not that different from ordinary monetary policy. We believe a strong and stable dollar is in the interest of the United States and the global economy. Our policies aim to keep inflation low and create a stronger economy, which will lead to a strong and stable dollar in the medium term. We don't anticipate changing our monetary policy based on hypothetical threats to the dollar. Holding a news conference allows us to communicate our decisions and outlook more effectively.", "'QUESTION': Are people expecting too much from the Federal Reserve in terms of helping the economy recover? And has that complicated your monetary policymaking?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve has been transparent and accountable in its efforts to help the economy recover. While there may be expectations for quick recoveries after financial crises, historical evidence shows that it takes longer for economies to fully recover. The Federal Reserve will continue to do its best to support the economy through monetary policy.", "QUESTION: Are people expecting too much from the Federal Reserve in terms of helping the economy recover? And has that complicated your monetary policymaking?\nANSWER: The slow recovery from financial crises may be due to inadequate policy responses, such as insufficient recapitalization of the banking system and restoration of credit flows. However, the Federal Reserve remains committed to supporting a strong recovery despite the challenges. The recovery process is slower than desired, but the pace is expected to pick up over time. The U.S. will eventually return to being a productive and dynamic economy."]}
