Chair Yellen, a number of Fed officials have proj ected in the lead-up to this m eeting that the most likely timin \u00a0for liftoff was around the middle of next year.  I wonder if you could clarify that.  You said in your statement that \u201cpatient\u201d means not for at least two meetings.  Your forecast that\u2014the FOMC\u2019s forecasts seem to be consistent with something like a middle-of-the-year liftoff.  Can you speak to that?  And can you also speak to the downdraft we\u2019re seeing in inflation now and, in particular, the market-based inflation expect ations and whether that gives the Committee any hesitance about proceeding towards liftoff in the months ahead\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I did say that the stat ement that the Committee can be patient should be interpreted as meaning that it is unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings.  Now, that doesn\u2019t  point to any preset or  predetermined time at which normalization is\u2014will begin.  There are a range of views on the Committee, and it will be dependent on how incoming data bear on the progress the ec onomy is making.   First of all, I want to emphasize that no meeti ng is completely off the table, in the sense that if we do see faster progress toward our obj ectives than we currently expect, then it is possible that the process of nor malization would occur sooner than we now an ticipate.  And, of course, the converse is also true .  So, at this point, we thi nk it unlikely that it will be appropriate\u2014that we will see conditions for at leas t the next couple of mee tings that will make it appropriate\u2014for us to decide to begin normalizat ion.  A number of Committee participants have indicated that, in their view, conditions could be appropriate by the middle of next year, but there is no preset time.  And there are a range of vi ews as to when the appropriate conditions will likely fall in place.  So that\u2019s something we will be watching closely as the year unfolds. You asked also, I think, about inflation.  A nd, as I mentioned in my press statement, especially with the downward pressures on inflat ion that we expect to see for a little while because of declining oil prices and falling import pr ices, we certainly expect headline inflation t \u00a0be under downward pressure for a while.  And, as I mentioned, most participants do envision that conditions will be appropriate sometime during th is coming year to begin normalizing policy.  And they do largely expect that inflation will be\u2014core inflation will probably be running close to its current level.  And headline inflation could ev en be lower.  But what they will want to have is a feeling of reasonabl e confidence that when we start the process of normalizing policy, that it will be moving up over time.  And, of course, as labor market conditions continue to improve, history suggests that as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, that that\u2019s likely to occur\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Marty Crutsinger wi th the Associated Press.  Given the\u2014what\u2019s happening now with the transition with the Fed, there seems to be a pattern developing that the market expects big ne ws to come when you have a press conference and no news to come when you don\u2019t have one.  But is that a goo d expectation?  And is  there any thought to starting to have a press c onference at every meeting\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I would really like to di scourage that expectation.  Every meeting that we have is a live meeting at which th e Committee could make a policy decision.  And we will feel free to do so.  So I would really like to strongly disc ourage the expectation that policy moves can only occur when there\u2019s a scheduled press conference.  And we have long had in place the ability to hold a press c onference call, rather than an in-person press conference.  And we did do so on a number of occasions in earlier years.  So the Committee, clearly, would want to be able to explain its reasoning.  As we  begin the process of normalizing policy, every meeting is live.  And if we were to decide at a meeting to begin to normalize policy, I expect we would hold a press conference call\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Was there concern\u2014S teve Liesman, CNBC\u2014was there concern expressed at the meeting that the signal comi ng from markets\u2014and a variety of markets\u2014lower oil prices, lower yields around the world, was one of deflation, and that that risk was one that should, perhaps, overshadow the concer n about inflation on the other side\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, thanks Steve.  We\u2019re very attentive to global developments and certainly discuss them in the meeting.  The very s ubstantial decline we have seen in oil prices is one of the most important developments shaping th e global outlook.  It will have different effects in different regions and could well have effects on financial markets, as we are seeing.  I think the judgment of the Committee is that, from the standpoint of the United States and the U.S. outlook, that the decline we have seen in oil pri ces is likely to be, on net, a positive.  It\u2019s something that\u2019s certainly good for families, for households.  It\u2019s putting more money in their pockets.  Having to spend less on gas and energy, a nd so, in that sense, it\u2019s like a tax cut that boosts their spending power.  The United Stat es remains\u2014although our production of oil has increased dramatically, we still remain a net importe r of oil.  Of course there may be some offset in the form of reduced drilling activity, and possibly some change, some reduction in cap-ex plans in the drilling area.  But, on balance, I w ould see these developments as a positive for the standpoint of the U.S. economy. With respect to deflation, we see downward pr essure on headline inflation from declining energy prices.  We certainly recognize that that  is going to be pushing down headline inflation and may even spill over, to some extent, to core inflation.  But, at this point, although we indicated we\u2019re monitoring inflation developmen ts carefully, we see these developments as transitory.  And the Committee continues to be lieve\u2014especially with the improvement we\u2019re seeing in the labor market, which we expect to continue\u2014that inflation will move back up to ou \u00a02 percent objective over time.  As I indicated, we will want to feel, I believe, that people will expect to feel reasonably confident about th at when they\u2014when the process of normalization begins.  But we do expect them to be transitory\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: \u00a0Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Madame Chair, there\u2019s a big gap between the pace markets expect you to rais e interest rates and th e rate you\u2019ve indicated in your \u201cdot plot.\u201d  Are markets mis understanding your intentions?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So that\u2019s difficult for me to  say.  What I want to say is that our objective is to communicate as clearly as we pos sibly can about our plans and how we see the economic environment unfolding.  When the pa rticipants in the Committee fill out their projections, they\u2019re asked to give  the path of the federal funds rate and of the various economic variables that they consider most likely.  They\u2019re not asked to talk about all the different things that could happen, recognizing there is uncertaint y, and the paths of the funds rate that they would consider appropriate if t hose other alternatives were to happen.  But other alternatives, I think, are priced into the market.  And one reason  that the market prices may be different than the Committee\u2019s is because they place probability on other outcomes that look different than what they regard as the modal forecast.  They ma y also have a different set of expectations about how the\u2014about the economic outlook and how it\u2019s lik ely to unfold.  So I recognize that there are significant differences.  I can\u2019t tell you exactly wh at they\u2019re due to.

It is often the case that when oil prices move down and the dollar apprecia tes, that that tends to put downward pressure on inflation compensation and on longer-term rates.  We also have safe-haven flows that may be affecting longer-term Treasury yields.  So I can\u2019t tell you exactly what is driving market developments.

I was just hoping you could go into a little more detail about the oil effect.  Even though you see it as transitory, does that give you a little more  room to keep rates low in the next few months?  And if\u2014alternately, if prices bounce bac k, what\u2019s that going to do to your  ability to change rates, and how might you react to that\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well I\u2014I\u2019d sa y, you know, that I think what we have seen since the mid-\u201980s is that, in an environment where in flation expectations ar e well anchored, that movements in oil and commodity pr ices and import prices tend to have transitory effects on the inflation outlook.  There were many years in which we  had unanticipated increa ses in oil prices,   really beginning in 2004 and 2005, that put upwar d pressure on headline inflation and sometimes even spilled through into core, and, typicall y, the Committee looked through those impacts on inflation with the view that they would be transi tory.  And I think experience bears out that they were transitory.  And I think that\u2019s the Committee\u2019s expectati on here.  Inflation, even core inflation, has been running below our inflation objective.  Movements in oil, you know, now down and perhaps later up, will move inflation around, certainly headline inflation.  But the Committee, at this point, anticipates those impacts to be transitory.  So as long as participant \u00a0feel reasonably confident that the inflation pr ojection is one where we  expect to meet our 2 percent objective ove r time, that\u2019s what I thi nk how they\u2019ll be looking at  things as we decide on the path for the funds rate\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Binya Appelbaum, New York Times .  Does \u201ca couple\u201d mean two?  And when you talk about reasonab le confidence in infla tion expectations, can you elaborate a little bit a bout what it would take to give you re asonable confidence that inflation is headed back to 2 percent\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So \u201ca couple\u201d\u2014I believe th e dictionary probably says, \u201ca couple\u201d means two.  So, \u201ca couple\u201d means tw o.  And with respect to infl ation\u2014our forecast for inflation and inflation expectations, let me start by saying I think it\u2019s important th at monetary policy be forward looking.  The lags in monetary policy are long, and, therefore, the Committee has to base its decisions on how to set the federal funds rate looking into the future.  Theory is important, and theories that are consistent with  historical evidence will be something that governs the thinking of many people around the table.  Typically, we have seen that as long as inflation expectations are well anchored, that as  the labor market recove rs, we\u2019ll gradually see upward pressure on both wages and prices, and th at inflation will tend to move back toward 2 percent.  I think historically we have see n, as the economy strengthens and slack diminishes, that inflation does tend to gr adually rise over time.  And as long\u2014you know, I\u2014just speaking for myself, I will be looking for evidence that I think strengthens my confidence in that view and, you know, looking at the full range of data th at bear on whether or not that\u2019s a reasonable view of how events will unfold.

Chair Yellen, a lot of attention has been focused on liftoff.  But, I wonder, has the Committee discussed what happens after that liftoff and what, you know, the rate path would be after you make the first move\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, I think you raise a very important poin t because, although there is a great deal of market focus on the timing of liftoff, what to ma tter in thinking about the stance of policy is what the entire path of interest ra tes will look like.  And I re ally don\u2019t have much for you other than to say that they will be data de pendent\u2014that, over time, the stance of policy will be adjusted to try to keep the economy on a tr ack where we see contin uing progress toward achieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability.

Why do you still view that as transitory\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So you\u2014your fi rst question is:  Why is it that the Committee sees unemployment as declining sligh tly below its estimate of the longer-run natura l rate?  And, I think, in part, the reason for that is that in flation is running below our objective, and the Committee wants to see inflation move back towa rd our objective over time .  And a short period of a very slight undershoot of unemployment below th e natural rate will facili tate a slightly faster return of inflation to our object ive.  It is, I should say, a very small undershoot in a situation where there is great uncertainty about exactly  what constitutes maximum employment or a longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  We also  do see the different measures of slack in the labor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is.  The standard unemployment rate, for quite some time now, has b een signaling a little bit less slack in the labor market than measures that are somewhat broade r that, for example, include the unusually large number of people who were part-time employed but  would prefer full-time jobs.  And the portion of the decline we\u2019ve seen in la bor force participation, that look s like it would disa ppear in a\u2014or be eroded in a stronger economy.  And so it may be  that with a very small undershoot of this longer-run normal level of the unemployment ra te, as measured by the standard unemployment rate, we\u2019ll be seeing some further progress on those other margins of slack.  But it\u2019s important to point out that the Committee is not anticipating an ove rshoot of its 2 percent inflation objective \u00a0 Oh, and longer-dated expectations.  Well, wh at I would say, we refer to this in the statement as \u201cinflation compensation\u201d rather than  \u201cinflation expectations.\u201d  The gap between the nominal yields on 10-year Treasuries, for exam ple, and TIPS have declined\u2014that\u2019s inflation compensation.  And five-year, five-year-forwards, as you\u2019ve said, have al so declined.  That could reflect a change in inflati on expectations, bu t it could also reflect ch anges in assessment of inflation risks.  The risk prem ium that\u2019s necessary to compen sate for inflation, that might especially have fallen if the proba bilities attached to very high in flation have come down.  And it can also reflect liquidity effects in markets.  And, for example, it\u2019s sometimes the case that\u2014when there is a flight to safety, that flight te nds to be concentrated in nominal Treasuries and could also serve to compress that spread.  So I th ink the jury is out about exactly how to interpret that downward move in inflation compensation.  And we indicated that we are monitoring inflation developments carefully\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Madame Chair, Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television.  I want to follow up, if I could, on firming going forward, on the nor malization once liftoff takes place.  I know you said this is going to be data dependent.

And do you think a person that ha s\u2014that spent 21 years of  his career at Goldman Sachs is in a position to regain public cr edibility about conf licts of interest\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, let me say that I th ink it\u2019s very important for the Federal Reserve System to have confidence in the quality  of its supervision.  And I do have a good deal of confidence in the quality of our supervision program, fo r the banking organizations w \u00a0supervise in general, and that also applies to  the largest banking organizations.  We rely on examiners who are in the field and at the Re serve Banks to be provi ding information about what\u2019s happening in those organizations.  But that  information feeds into a process in which it is not individuals at any single Reserve Bank.  But,  at the Board, it\u2019s a Board-led process, and it involves senior officials at a number of different  Reserve Banks.  It\u2019s also a multidisciplinary process that involves not only pe ople from supervision, but those from markets, from economic research.  Experts who focus on financial stability all come together to evaluate the information that they have and to assign supe rvisory ratings and decide on th e appropriate program for all of those large institutions.  We\u2019ve strengthened th e process of supervision enormously since the crisis, and I feel a very good sense of confidence in how we\u2019re carrying that out. Now, it is important to make sure that we ha ve fed into this process all the information that\u2019s relevant to making the right decisions.  An d when there are individuals who are examiners, who may disagree with others in their team about how to interpre t what\u2019s going on at a particular institution, it\u2019s important that ther e be channels by which they can make sure that disagreements are fed up to the highest levels.  This is tr ue throughout the work we do.  We do economic forecasting, and our\u2014the FOMC receives informati on to help us make decisions, but obviously there are disagreements about\u2014among economists a bout how to interpret developments.  It\u2019s also important for us there to make sure we unders tand alternative views.  So  this is important in supervision.  We\u2019ve announced that the Board has undertaken a review of whether or not there are appropriate mechanisms in place in all of th e Reserve Banks that individuals who disagree with decisions can make their own views known and feed into the process, and we\u2019ve also asked our inspector general to look into that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Jeff K earns from Bloomberg News.  I\u2019d also like to get off monetary policy and ask you a bout the Federal Reserve\u2019s re lationship with Congress.  Specifically, how worried are you about legislati on that has been proposed, and may be proposed again in the next Congress, th at would reduce Fed independence?  Would you see yourself trying to fight back?  Or would you see yourself trying to  go to Congress to work with them to do more with transparency or something else to reduce their co ncerns without making them law?  And, if there were bills sent to the White  House, would you talk to the President about vetoing them?  Or do you have any confidence that he would veto b ills that would reduce the Fed\u2019s independence?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So let me simply say that Congress has assigned us  important tasks in monetary policy and in other role s that we perform, and the Fede ral Reserve is highly focused on attempting to carry out the mandates that Congress has given us in the area of monetary policy.  It\u2019s our dual mandate to promote maximum empl oyment and price stability, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.  You know, I would say that the ability of a central bank to make the decisions about monetary policy that it regards as  in the best longer-run interest s of the economy, free of short-run political interference,  is very important to the effective conduct of monetary policy.  And I think that history shows, not onl y in the United States but arou nd the world, that central bank independence promotes better economic performan ce.  So I do think central bank independence is very important, and that it\u2019s  important to make sure that we  can make the decisions we think are best, free of short-run political inte rference with respect to monetary policy. We should be accountable, and we are accountable  to Congress in explaining what we do.  I believe strongly in transparency, and I believ e strongly that we shoul d communicate as clearl \u00a0what we are doing and the rationale for doing it , and I am very open to looking for ways ourselves to improve our communications and tr ansparency, and working with Congress to do that.  But I would be very concerned about ac tions.  Back in 1978, Congr ess explicitly passed legislation to ensure that there would be no GAO audits of monetary policy decisionmaking\u2014 namely, policy audits.  I certainly hope that will continue, and I will try to forcefully make the case for why that\u2019s important\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Would it veto\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: I cannot speak for the White House.

Did that come up in the meeting in your discussion a bout the global economic developments?  As you know, there\u2019s a lot of con cern that with the drop in oil pric es, the Russian economy could be in some trouble.  Russia owes a lot of money to U.S.  and foreign banks and Russian companies.  Is there any concern about default?  Any concern about possible contag ion?  And, if so, has the Fed taken any steps to prepare for that?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, we certainly did review global economic developments, including developments in the Russian economy.  Clearly, Russia has been hit very hard by the decline in oil prices, and the ru ble has depreciated enormously in  value, and this is posing a series of very difficult economic conditions in the Russian economy. Of course we discussed what the potential spi llovers are to the United States, which could occur both through trade and financia l linkages.  But these linkages ar e actually relatively small. \u00a0Russia accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. trade volume, and U.S. banks\u2019 exposure to Russian residents is really quite small in terms of\u2014relative to their capit al.  In terms of the portfolios of U.S. residents, there are Russian securities, but th ey are\u2014they account for a very small share.  So I expect that the linkages back  to the spillovers to the United States, both through trade and financial channels, would be sm all.  Europe, of course, is somewhat more exposed to Russia, both because Russia is an impor tant supplier of oil and natural gas to Europe and the financial linkages are somewhat greater.  But, in the case of the United States, I see the spillovers relative\u2014it is pret ty small.

Same to you\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: There\u2019s a contag ion risk to the\u2014from low oil prices that people are talking about in the markets.  What does it mean  to the banks that have lent, you know, into the oil patch with the low oil prices?  And I guess, you know, your warnings about leveraged loans\u2014you have made warnings over the past y ear about leveraged lending.  Are you worried that they haven\u2019t be en heeded?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, I mean, there is some\u2014you \u2019re talking about in the United States exposure?  I mean, we have seen some impacts of lower oil prices on the spreads for high-yield bonds, where there\u2019s exposure to oil companies that may see distress or  a decline in their earnings, and we have seen some increase in spr eads on high-yield bonds more generally.  I think for the banking system, as a whole, the exposure to oil\u2014I\u2019m not aware of significant issues there.  This is the kind of thing that is part of risk management for banking organizations and the kind of thing they look at in stre ss tests.  But the movements in oil prices have been very large and undoubtedly unexpected. \u00a0We\u2014in terms of leverage, and whether or not levered entities could be badly affected by movements in oil prices, leverage in the financ ial system, in general, is way down from the levels before the crisis.  So it\u2019s not a major con cern that there are levere d entities that would be badly affected by this, but we\u2019ll have to watch carefully.  There have be en large and unexpected movements in oil prices\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Good after noon, Chair Yellen.  Steve Beckner of MNI.  I will go back to interest rates, if you don\u2019t mind.  Actual ly, it\u2019s a question about balance sheet effects on the overall appropriate le vel of monetary policy.  In reaffirming the reinvestment policy, the FOMC says, once again, that this will help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  In the past, it\u2019s said that the large portfolio of securities will exer t a downward effect on long-term interest rates.  As you look forward to raising sh ort-term rates, to what extent does the FOMC need to take into account this sort of resi dual, accommodative effect of maintaining a large balance sheet\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I agree, and that\u2019s why we  stated that we typically think of the monetary policy impact of our a sset purchases as depending on the stock of assets that we hold on our balance sheet rather than the flow of purchases, and so we \u2019re reminding the public that we continue to hold a large stock of assets, and that is tending to push down term premiums in longer-term yields.  We made clear when we\u2014or  tried to make clear\u2014when we issued our normalization principles in September that we inte nd to use changes in our target for the federal funds rate as the main tool that we will actively use to adjust financial conditions.  Rather than actively planning to sell the assets that we\u2019v e put onto our balance sheet, sometime after we begin raising our targets for s hort-term interest rates, depending on economic and financial conditions, we\u2019re likely to reduc e or cease reinvestment and gra dually run down the stock of ou \u00a0assets.  But our active tool for adjusting monetary \u2014the stance of monetary  policy so that it is appropriate for the economic needs for the countr y, that will be done through adjusting our short-term target range for the federal funds rate\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Kevin Hall with McClatc hy Newspapers.

You didn\u2019t mentio n him by name in your being pleased by quality of supervision.  Are you pleased with Mr. Dudley\u2019s handling of the events\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So let me start with that .  I have great conf idence in President Dudley.  He\u2019s done a fine job in  running the New York Fed, and I want to be very clear that I have great confidence in him.  He\u2019s a distinguished public serv ant, and he has worked very hard in the aftermath of the crisis to make sure that  the New York Fed is doing  all that it needs to do to contribute to the work that we do both in fina ncial stability and in supe rvision.

The Committee also updated its forward guidance, stating that it can be patient in normalizing monetary policy, which is consistent with its previous guidance.The FOMC sees ongoing improvement in the labor market and expects a moderate pace of economic growth, with inflation likely to gradually move back towards its objective as transitory factors dissipate. However, the Committee is mindful of recent declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation and will closely monitor developments in this area.The FOMC projects a slight decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years, with real GDP growth slightly higher than previously projected. Despite lower near-term inflation due to energy prices, the Committee expects inflation to gradually move back towards its 2 percent goal.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) updated its guidance to reflect a shift in focus towards economic conditions rather than the timing of the first rate increase, as the asset purchase program has ended. The Committee believes that as employment and inflation objectives are met, policy accommodation can be reduced, but it will remain patient and unlikely to begin the normalization process in the next couple of meetings, with any changes in the federal funds rate target range dependent on incoming information.If progress in the economy is slower than expected, increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will happen later than anticipated. The Committee believes that even after reaching mandate-consistent levels of employment and inflation, economic conditions may warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below normal levels for some time.The Committee plans to continue reinvesting proceeds from maturing securities to maintain accommodative financial conditions. The sizable holdings of longer-term securities will support progress towards the objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Can you clarify the timing for liftoff and address the current downdraft in inflation and market-based inflation expectations?\n'ANSWER': The Committee will not begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings, but there is no predetermined time for liftoff. If progress towards objectives is faster than expected, normalization could occur sooner. Inflation is expected to be under downward pressure due to declining oil prices, but participants anticipate conditions will be appropriate to begin normalizing policy sometime this year. The goal is to have confidence that inflation will move up over time as labor market conditions improve.", "'QUESTION': Is it a good expectation that big news will only come when there is a press conference, and will there be a press conference at every meeting?\n'ANSWER': The expectation that policy moves can only occur during scheduled press conferences should be discouraged. Every meeting is live and the Committee can make policy decisions at any meeting. Press conference calls can be held instead of in-person conferences, and if the decision to normalize policy is made, a press conference call would likely be held.", "'QUESTION': Was there concern expressed at the meeting that the signal coming from markets was one of deflation?\n'ANSWER': The Committee discussed the decline in oil prices and its effects on the global outlook. From the standpoint of the US, the decline in oil prices is likely to be a positive, putting more money in households' pockets. While there is downward pressure on inflation from declining energy prices, the Committee sees these developments as transitory and expects inflation to move back up to the 2 percent objective over time.", "'QUESTION': Is the market misunderstanding the Federal Reserve's intentions regarding interest rate hikes?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve aims to communicate its plans and economic outlook clearly. The Committee's projections focus on the most likely path for the federal funds rate, not all possible scenarios. Market prices may differ due to the market's consideration of alternative outcomes and different expectations about the economic outlook. The Federal Reserve aims to communicate its views on the economy and the federal funds rate as clearly as possible.", "'QUESTION': It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make you uncomfortable, where markets are now?\n'ANSWER': There are various factors affecting market interest rates, including global economic developments, oil prices, and the value of the dollar. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact drivers of market developments, but the Federal Reserve is committed to communicating its thoughts clearly.", "'QUESTION': Can the transitory effects of oil prices give the FOMC more room to keep rates low in the next few months? And how would they react if prices bounce back?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC believes that movements in oil and commodity prices have transitory effects on inflation. They have looked through past increases in oil prices and expect the same for current fluctuations. As long as inflation projections align with their 2 percent objective, they will consider keeping rates low.", "'QUESTION': Does \u00e2\u0080\u009ca couple\u00e2\u0080\u009d mean two? And when you talk about reasonable confidence in inflation expectations, can you elaborate a little bit about what it would take to give you reasonable confidence that inflation is headed back to 2 percent?\n'ANSWER': \"A couple\" means two. Regarding inflation, the Federal Reserve considers forward-looking monetary policy. As the labor market improves and inflation expectations remain anchored, wages and prices will gradually increase, leading to inflation moving back towards 2 percent. The decision will be based on forecasts and confidence in those forecasts.", "'QUESTION': Has the Committee discussed what happens after liftoff and the rate path after the first move?\n'ANSWER': The focus should be on the entire path of interest rates, not just the timing of liftoff. The stance of policy will be adjusted based on data to achieve maximum employment and price stability. Monetary policy will remain accommodative for a long time, and moves will be data dependent. The decline in inflation expectations is seen as transitory.", "'QUESTION': Why does the Committee see unemployment running below the longer-run natural rate and why is the decline in inflation expectations viewed as transitory?\n'ANSWER': The Committee wants to see inflation move back towards its objective, so a slight undershoot of unemployment will facilitate a faster return of inflation. Different measures of slack in the labor market point to different assessments of maximum employment. The decline in inflation expectations could reflect changes in inflation risks or liquidity effects in markets, and the Committee is monitoring inflation developments carefully.", "'QUESTION': Does the number of dissents at this meeting suggest a lack of consensus among the Committee members?\n'ANSWER': There is a wide range of opinion within the Committee, and it is appropriate for members to express their views.

While there have been impacts on high-yield bonds and unexpected movements in oil prices, leverage in the financial system is lower than before the crisis, so it is not a major concern.", "'QUESTION': To what extent does the FOMC need to consider the residual accommodative effect of maintaining a large balance sheet when raising short-term rates?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC acknowledges that the large stock of assets on its balance sheet is pushing down long-term yields. While the FOMC plans to reduce or cease reinvestment and gradually decrease the stock of assets, the main tool for adjusting monetary policy will be through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk a little bit about housing? What do you think is holding housing back? What can Congress do? What will you tell Congress in the coming year? \n'ANSWER': I have great confidence in President Dudley and his handling of the New York Fed. He has worked hard to ensure the Fed contributes to financial stability and supervision. As for housing, it continues to be a drag on wealth creation. Congress can take steps to address the issues and I will communicate our concerns to them in the coming year.", "'QUESTION': What is the current state of the housing market?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen expresses surprise at the slow recovery of the housing market, attributing it to tight credit conditions for borrowers with less than perfect credit ratings. She hopes that the situation will improve over time and expects household formation to increase as the labor market improves and households feel more financially secure."]}
