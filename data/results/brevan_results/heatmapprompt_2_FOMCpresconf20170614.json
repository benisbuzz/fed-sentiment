So there \u2019s no specific level of the federal funds rate that means we\u2019 re well under  way.  But it\u2019 s also a question of not only the current level , but our confidence in the outlook and our projections for the future path of    the federal funds rate.

Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  We \u2019ve now had a very long streak of \u2014or fairly long streak of wea k inflation numbers , at least measured by the CPI th is morning as well.  Marketplace -based inflation expectations are declining.   What kind of vigilance are you now saying is needed in terms of wea k inflation?  How does that interact with your policy outlook?  And would further disappointments argue for pressing    \u201cpause \u201d on rate hikes or delay ing balance sheet runoff?  How do you think about thos e two potential responses to wea k inflation?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So let me just say , as I emphasized in my statement and always say , mone tory policy is not on a preset course.  We indicated in our statement  today that we \u2019re closely monitoring inflation developments and certainly have taken note of the fact that there have been several weak readings , particular ly on core inflation.  Our statement indicates that we expect inflation to remain low in the near te rm.  But , on the other hand, we continue to feel that with a strong labor market  and a labor market that \u2019s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up.  Now, obviously we need to monitor that very carefully  and ensure , especially with roughly five years o f inflation running under our 2 percent  objective \u2014that is a goal to which the committee is strongly committed.  And we need to make sure that we have in place the policies that are necessary to achieve 2 percent  inflation , and I pledge that we  will do that.  But let me say , with respect to recent readings, i t\u2019s important not to overreact to a few readings , and data on inflation can be noisy.  As I pointed out, there have been some idiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months, particularly a  huge decline in cell telephone service plan prices, some declines in prescription drugs.  We had an exceptionally low reading on core PC E in March, and that will continue to hold down 12- month changes until that reading drops out.  But we are \u2014this morning \u2019s reading on the CPI showed weakness in a number of categories , and it \u2019s certainly something that we will be closely monitoring in the months ahead.  We will\u2014we \u2019re focused on making our policy decisions on the medium -term outlook, and we will, you know, be looking carefully at incoming data and, a s always , revising our outlook and policy plans as appropriate.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Any implications for  beginning of runoff  and further increases in the fed funds rate?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So \u2014continue , as today \u2019s actions show , to feel that the economy is doing well, is showing resilience .  We hav e a very strong labor market, an un employment rate that\u2019s declined to levels we ha ve not seen since 2001.  And , even with some modera tion in the pace of job growth, we have a labor market that continues to strengthen and policy remains \u2014remains  accommodative.  So, I \u2014it\u2019 s important that inflation move up to our 2 percent objective , as our projections  show we cont inue to expect that and be lieve  the conditions are in place.  But we will monitor incoming data , obviously , and be attentive to rethinking our outlook if it seems appropriate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Craig Torres  from Bloomberg News.  Hate to belabor the point on inflation, but I was wondering, I hear a lot of the so- called NAIRU in your conversation now and in other committee members \u2019.  It\u2019s an unobservable thing.  At best, it\u2019 s an estimate.  And the assumptions in there seem to me that the economy today is much like the economy yeste rday, when , if anything , we\u2019ve learned that the post -recession  economy is vastly different than it was before the recession.  So I \u2019m wondering , something you\u2019 ve talked about i s to focus more on the change in inflation \u2014actual inflation , and is it going up or is it going down , and basing policy more on that.  What would be the risk of that , and why not adopt that if you have such a long period of underperformance \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, we are closely looking at the actual performance of inflation and altering our views on the basis of discrepancies between what we see and our expectations.  And, well, it is very difficult to pin down what is the longer -run normal rate of unemployment , and there \u2019s a great deal of uncertainty about it , and it \u2019s hard to pin down, especially given the    fact that the so -called Phillips curve  appears to be quite flat.  That means that inflation doesn \u2019t respond very much or very quickly to movements in unemployment.  Nevertheless, that relationship , I believe, remain s at work.  We have seen that operate historically.  Now, in the face of very low unemployment that we have seen, while wage growth has picked up somewhat, it remains low , and inflation is influenced by a number of different factors , but we certainly haven \u2019t seen much or any evident upward pressure on inflation.  In light of that, the C ommittee has successively moved down its estimate of the normal longer -run rate of unemployment , and in this projection, it\u2019 s moved down to 4.6 percent , a tenth lower than it  was last time.  So, while the unemployment rate is below that, it\u2019 s not that much\u2014it\u2019 s not that much below it\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Ana Swanson, t he Washington Post .  We saw measures of consumer and business confidence rise after inauguration on expectations tha t the A dministration would move quickly to introduce policy changes like tax cuts and infrastructure spending.  But some of those policy changes have been slower to materialize than initially expected.  How do you view the positive and negative risks  from policy changes to your outlook, and has your view changed on that at all i n the last six months \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I would say that business and household sentiment remains quite strong, although many forecasters have pushed back somewhat the timing of the  expected policy changes , such as changes to tax policy or  fiscal policy more generally.  I would say that , based on my observation of actual spending behavior and my discussions with our wide range of contacts , that I haven \u2019t seen very much evidence that , thus far , expectations of policy changes have driven substantial changes in either consumer spending or investment spending.  So I really wouldn\u2019 t expect any significant pullback .  Many of our business contacts \u2014I think their    confidence remains high.  They \u2019ve not really changed their plans yet , and they have a wait -and-see attitude.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times .  Measures of financial cond itions show that since the F ed started raising interest rates two years ago, financial condi tions actually have loosened.  Consumer business borrowing costs in many cases are down.  Do you have the sense that the market is not listening to you?  How much of a concern is that for you?  And , at some point, does it convince you that you need to rais e rates perhaps more quickly?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, in deciding what the appropriate path of rates is, we take many different factors into account.  We have certainly noticed the stock market is up considerably over the last year.  That usually shows up in financial conditions indexes and is an important reason why some of them show easier financial conditions.  There\u2019 s been a modest decrease recently in the value of the dollar , although it \u2019s up substantially since mid -2014.  So we take those factors into account in deriving our forecasts and deciding the appropriate stance of policy.  We have done that , and \u2014but other things also affect the stance of policy.  So there really can \u2019t be any simple relationship.  We \u2019re not targetin g financial conditions.  We \u2019re trying to set a path of the federal funds rate, but taking account of those factors and others that don\u2019 t show up in a  financial conditions index.  We\u2019re trying to generate paths for employment and inflation that meet our man dated objectives\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Howard Schneider with Reuters.  So, on inflation again, I just wonder, what \u2019s the possibility that something more , sort of \u2014I mean , nefarious is at work here, right, which is that the , sort of , weight of central bank credibility now \u2014for a generation , really \u2014plus globalization has just pushed the world into a low -inflation environment that \u2019s going to be    very hard to get wages and prices moving again.  And then, related to  that, you know, if NAIRU is 4.2, why not 4 or why not 3.8?  You banked a quarter \u2014you know, a full percentage point now , so you\u2019 re probably at less risk of  falling behind whatever curve exists.  Why rush?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I don\u2019 t think central  bank credibility \u2014at least the F ed\u2019s credibility \u2014has been impaired.  We look at a whole variety of indicators of inflation expectations .  Professional forecasters \u2014whether it \u2019s in the B lue Chip or the S urvey of Professional F orecasters, those expectations have remained  quite steady and in close alignment with our 2 percent  inflation target.  TIPS -based  measures of inflation compensation do not provide straight reads on market participants \u2019 estimates and expectations about inflation.  They embody other elements \u2014risk premia and liquidity premia as well.  They had moved down and now have moved\u2014they remain at low levels , but they have moved back up again.  It is true that some household surveys of  inflation expectations have moved down, but overall I wouldn\u2019 t say that we \u2019ve seen a broad undermining of inflation expect ations.  But you asked also, I guess , about have structural changes perhaps impacted the inflation process , and that certainly is possible.  And estimates of the normal longer -run unemployment rate\u2014they are quite uncertain.  I agree with your assessment there.  We \u2019re really not certain what they are.  And policy is not being \u2014is not based on some firmly held preconceived notion.  We\u2019re watching very carefully how the actual economy performs.  And, you know, I continue to believe, though, that with job growth running well in excess , even with the moderation of the level that \u2019s needed to provide for new entrants  in the labor market, we do have a strengthening economy .  With policy accommodative , all that we \u2019re doin g in raising rates is moving \u2014removing a bit of accommodation heading toward a neutral pace.  And I see that a s appropriate.  We\u2019re not moving so aggressively as to put a br ake on continued improvement in the labor    market.  But I think that that \u2019s a prudent  move , to move in a gradual way to remove accommodation , with unemplo yment now \u2014and not only , I should say , the unemployment rate , but I think any indicator of labor market performance and  tightness that you could look at , whether it \u2019s household perceptions  of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings , all of these indicators do signal a tight labor mar ket. Now, with inflation below 2 percent , I think it\u2019 s appropriate that the labor market be that tight.  But , on the other hand, I think we want to avoid the risk.  We want to keep the expansion on a sustainable path and avoid the risk that at some point we need\u2014we find ourselves in a situation where we \u2019ve done nothing and then need to raise the funds rate so rapidly that we risk a recession.  So moving to some extent in a timely way to remove accommodation with a strong economy and continued labor market strength, the C ommittee believes , is an appropriate  management of risks.  But we are attentive to the fact that inflation is running below our 2 percent objective , that we \u2019ve faced that  situation now for a long time , and it\u2019 s really quite essential that we put in place policies that will succeed in moving inflation back to our 2 percent objective , and it \u2019s a symmetric objective.  So that \u2019s a risk that we face as well.  The C ommittee believes we have conditions in place for inflation to move up, but that \u2019s also a risk .  And those things point , I think, to a gradual pace of reducing accommodation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.   Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.  Recently, a group of economists sent  the F ed a letter earlier this  month disagreeing with your 2 percent  inflation target and saying they would like the economy to run a bit hotter.  They don \u2019t think the labor market is so tight.  You  say you \u2019re committed to the 2 percent target, but what do you say to them?   \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, at  the time that we adopted the 2 percent  target \u2014it was back in 2012\u2014we had a very thorough discussion of the factors that should determine what our inflation objective should be.  And, you know, I believe that was a well -thought -out decision.  Now, at the moment, we are highly foc used on trying to achieve our 2 percent  objective.  And we recognize the fact that inflation has been running below , and it \u2019s essential for us to move inflation back to that objective.  Now, we \u2019ve learned a lot in the meantime , and assessments of the level of the neutral likely level , currently and going forward, of the neutral federal funds rate have changed and are quite a bit lower than they stood in 2012 or earlier years.  And that means that the economy is \u2014has the potential where policy could be constrained by the zero lower bound more frequently than at the time that we adopted our 2 percent objective.  So it \u2019s that recognition that causes  people to think we might be better off with a higher inflation objective, and that \u2019s an important set\u2014this is one of our most critical decision s and one we are attentive to evidence and outside thinking.  It\u2019s one that we will be reconsidering at some future time.  And it \u2019s important for our decisions to be informed by a wide range  of views  and research which is ongoing inside and outside the F ed.  But a reconsideration of that objective needs to take account not only of benefits of a higher in\u2014 potential benefits of a higher inflation target, but also the potential cost s that could be associated with it.  It needs to be a balanced assessment.  But  I would say that this is one of the most important questions facing monetary policy around the world in the future , and we very much look forward to seeing research by economists that will help inform our future decisions on this\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  Don Lee with the L .A. Times .  The F ed\u2019s projections continue to show the longer -run federal funds rate at 3 percent.  The markets are expecting 2 percent .  How    big of a concern is that gap in your mind?  What are the reasons for the  disconnect?  And, you know, what are the implications and the risks for the real economy?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So let me first say , it\u2019s not straightforward to determine exactly what expectations are embodied in market prices because there are t erm premia that affect these rates , and they may not really be as low as one would infer from a straight read.  That said, in part, expectations reflect estimates of what the neutral federal funds rate is and how it \u2019s likely to evolve over time.  And views have changed about that over time , and  there is a good deal of uncertainty about it.  So we have recently put out charts that try to show what the range  of uncertainty is around our path for the federal funds rate, especially as one goes further out.  There\u2019 s a good deal of uncertainty and\u2014tha t reflects the, like \u2014all the shocks that can affect the evolution of the economy , and also the fact, we \u2019re quite uncertain ourselves about what the likely \u2014what the evolution will be of the neutral federal funds rate.  So we do try to write that down and provide the public with information about our current expectations.  And the median now stands at around 3 percent , but we have uncertainty about that.  Many of my colleagues and I think that the current neutral level is  lower than that.  And as I said in my opening statement, the fed funds rate path reflects an expectation that that neutral rate will be moving up some in future years.  But that remains uncertain , and I think that \u2019s something that market participants are trying to assess , and we will be as well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  But do you see greater  volatility in the markets as it adjust s to the difference in the gap between the expectation and what the F ed\u2019s projections are for the  longer -run federal funds rate?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, our expectations are little changed.  I mean, the projections we released today are essentially identical to those.  And I think the market is aware of the  views of    participants  and is  assessing evidence itself to form their own views.  And it \u2019s imp ortant that the market take an independent look, and that we get to understand and see how market participants are interpreting evidence on the evolution of the economy.

How do you assess how you\u2019 ll handle that going forward?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we have indicated for quite some time, I guess, since  our\u2014at least since our 2014 normalization principles , that we wanted to reduce our balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way.  And we have tried systematically to communicate more about how we would do that as our plans have evolved.  And today \u2019s ann ouncement is another step in providing further details about how we plan to proceed s o that when this plan does go into effect, no one is taken by surprise and market participants understand how this will work. I think that we \u2014the plan is one that is consc iously intended to avoid creating market strains and to allow the market to adjust to a very gradual and predictable plan.  My hope and expectation is that when we decide to go forward with this plan, that there will be very little reaction to it, that it\u2019 s clear how we intend to proceed, and that this is something that will just run quietly in the background over a number of years, leading to a reduction in the size of our    balance sheet and in the outstanding stock of reserves, and that it \u2019s something that the C ommittee will not be reconsidering from time to time.  We think this is a workable plan, and it will, as one of my colleagues, President Harker , described it, it will be like watching paint dry, that this will just be something that runs quietly in t he background.  So that \u2019s my expectation and our intention.  Look, of course, if it turns out that there is a surpr ise and a substantial reaction , that is something we would have to take into account in deciding on the appropriate stance of policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  A couple of comments from A dministration officials I wanted to get your reaction to .  The Treasury Secretary and others have suggested that Dodd- Frank regulation and the way it \u2019s been impl ied\u2014applied have restricted credit growth in the economy, banks are not making loans that they otherwise would, and that has slowed growth.  Do you agree with that?  And if you get a new Vice Chair of Supervision who wanted to ease up on regulation, would you go along with that?  Also, I wanted to ask you \u2014it\u2019 s been reported the President has congratulated you on being a \u201clow interest \u201d person.  Would you agree with that characterization of your philosophy?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, with respect to the impact of c redit con ditions and bank regulation on slow growth, I \u2019ve previously , in testifying , indicated that I don \u2019t think that our regulations have played an important role , at least broadly speaking , in impeding credit growth and the growth of the economy.  And I \u2019ve pointed in the past to a number of statistics suggesting that cred it growth continues to be  healthy, including among small \u2014smaller community banks that are most concerned with regulatory burden.  I think when banks are undercapitalized and weak, that i mpedes credit growth.  And when banks are strong, they \u2019re in a much better position to lend.  So that \u2019s been a view that I \u2019ve stated previously.     Now, in terms of regulation, the Treasury recently issued, on Monday , a detailed report.  And that \u2019s quite a complicated document with lots of recommendations in it.  I haven \u2019t had a chance to review it thoroughly, so I don\u2019 t want to comment on too many details.  But I would say it underscores the importance of capital , liquidity, stress testing, and re solution planning in having a safe and sound banking system , which are views that I and my colleagues have long espoused.  Regulatory burden, when it \u2019s possible to ease it , and a good deal of the Treasury report is focused on regulatory burden, that \u2019s some thing that all regulators should be looking to do.  We strongly believe in the importance of tailoring our regulation to the size and complexity of institutions, of finding ways to relieve burden for community banks.  We have been focused and had a number of initiatives already in that direction, look ing for ways , for example, to simplify capital requirements for community banks.  And we \u2019ll continue in that direction and, in that sense, in those areas certainly share the views expressed in the Treasury repo rt.  So there are a number of areas and suggestions where our thinking aligns well.  There is probably some areas where we\u2019 re likely to have differences but quite \u2014you know, quite a number of areas where we\u2019re, you know, likely to be able to and already are taking actions that are consistent with those recommendations\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And the characterization of you as a low  interest rate person?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I have felt that it\u2019 s been appropriate for interest rates to remain low for a very long time.  We are in the process of , as the economy strengthens , normalizing interest rates.  But, certainly, we \u2019ve had a lot of years in which interest rates have been low.  I thought it was necessary to support the economy at that time and was strongly in favor of those policies.   \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Karen Mracek with Market News International.  Today you guys outlined the details of the plan to\u2014when you begin to e nd reinvestments.  But you stopped short of saying exactly when it would be implemented, only saying \u201c this year, \u201d and adding that that depended on how the economy evolved.  Can you tell us why you decided not to go ahead with it today?  Is there certain conditions that you\u2019 re looking for?  And then, as a second question, do you think that the \u2014you could raise rates and begin implementation of the plan at the same time?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we have tried as meticulously as we can to provide advanced warning to markets about how we would go about doing this so that market participants can prepare.  And today \u2019s announcement is another step in that process.  So we certainly wanted to get this information out before we actually undertake the beginning of this plan.  And, you know, as the statement says, we \u2019ve made no definite decision on the timing of the plan, but \u2014the timing of initiating the plan.  But if the economy evolves in line with our expectations , which, you know, we will be watching \u2014always are\u2014we could put this into effect relatively soon.  You asked about w hether or not we would do that and raise rates at the same meeting, and I would say, we \u2019ve made no decision about that, and it really hinges on the outlook and our assessment of conditions\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  You mentioned the Treasury report , and I just wanted to ask, how much weight do you give those recommendations in considering, you know, potential regulatory changes moving forward?  And also, more specifically, one of the re commendations relates to the Volcker rule.  I know you \u2019ve said in the past that, you know, it might be a good idea to re duce the burden on community banks , but it also talks about potentially exempting banks with trading assets and liabilities above a certain    level.  And I was wondering if you think that that \u2019s an idea that \u2019s worth exploring , that might be a good idea.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we have previously su ggested exempting community banks, smaller banks , entirely from the rule.  And a number of my colleagues have spoken about the Volcker r ule.  Implementation of it is frankly complex , and I \u2019m certainly open to looking at ways to reduce regulatory burden in that area.  The report endorses a restriction on proprietary trading.  So, in that sense, it endorses the main objective of the Volcker rule, which I was pleased to see.  But on implementation, it\u2019 s true that the rules were\u2014in part reflecting the way the legislation is written \u2014were, I think, necessarily complex, but we do have some ideas for how we might simplify the rule , and certainly it \u2019s something we \u2019re quite open to looking at\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And how much weight do you give Treasury recommendations?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I mean, Treasury has a \u2014set out a list of objectives for regulation that I \u2019m sympathetic to and endorse .  I think looking for ways to reduce regulatory burden, when it can be done without sacrificing safety and soundness or creating sys temic risk , that\u2019s something that all regulators should want to do.  We \u2019ve done an awful lot of rule writing  over the last five or six years.  And coming back and looking at where we have created burdens and ways in which we can simplify to reduce, that is  an objective that is core to the Treasury review and that we are very sympathetic with.  So, while we may not agree on every detail, certainly the suggestions that are made there are ones that we will pay attention to and in many cases are already on our own list of things we should review.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires.  In light of the plans to trim the balance sheet hopefully later this year, what have you learned about QE and your bond-buying policies as a tool for monetary policy ?  When they were launched, it wasn \u2019t something    you had, you know, engaged in on that scale before\u2014a lot of fear s that  it was going to create hyperinflation .  That hasn \u2019t ever seem ed to come to pass.  So, in light of QE as potentially a tool for the future \u2014you know, it might come back again\u2014what have you learned about how it works in the economy?  Like, where do you see it affect things?  You know, what are sort of the lessons learned of the experience\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, thanks.  That \u2019s a great question.  I mean, staff in the Federal Reserve and outside economists have done a great deal of work trying to evaluate QE .  I think the general conclusion is that it has worked in that it has put some downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, so -called ter m premiums embedded in longer -term interest rates.  There \u2019s disagreement among economists about exactly how large those effects are, and it \u2019s something that\u2019s difficult to pin down.  But , obviously, it has not caused runaway inflation, quite the contrary.  I mean, that was never my expectation , but I do remember when people were afraid that that would happen. We do have the tools.  We have, you know, even with a large balance sheet \u2014we intend to shrink our balance sheet now , but even with a large balance sheet, we retain the ability to move the fed funds rate and set it as appropriate for the needs of the economy.  So I think we have learned that it works.  It\u2019s a valuable part of the toolkit.  It\u2019s something that, if we were t o encounter an episode in the future of extreme weakness where \u2014I\u2019ve said we want the fed funds rate and movements in short -term interest rates, that\u2019 s our go- to number one main policy tool \u2014but if we were to hit the zero lower bound and constrained in our use of that tool, certainly balance sheet policies and forward guidance of the type that we provided, I believe , based on the evidence of how they worked, ought to remain part of our toolkit.  And we have said in the    bullets that we released today on our ba lance sheet that in such of \u2014an episode of such extreme weakness in the future, those are things we would consider going forward.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: One small follow -up.  Is $4\u00bd trillion sort of a natural limit to how high you might want to push the balance sh eet, or could you envision it going higher if you needed it to?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, we \u2019ve had no discussion of that issue, you know.  And our focus now is on getting it back to a more normal size.  But I would say , the use of QE in the United States relat ive to the size of our economy is not as high as it \u2019s been in some other countries that have employed it.  But that \u2019s something we haven \u2019t seriously even discussed.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Yellen , Patrick Gillespie with CNN.  It\u2019s workforce development w eek at the White House , and you highlighted several job training \u2014successful job training programs in your speech in March.  The President \u2019s budget has a 40 percent  cut to job training programs.  What is your response to the budget cut  to job training programs even though they expect to expand apprenticeship programs?  And do you believe that job training programs and apprenticeships are needed to help fix the job skills gap in the economy?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: .  Well, I \u2019m not going to comment on the P resident \u2019s budget , and these programs can be undertaken at many different levels.  I\u2019ve seen many nonprofits and states and local authorities put in place programs that looked to me to be successful.  I do think we have a tight labor market and one where employers have jobs where they \u2019re finding difficulty identifying workers with the appropriate skills.  In my own discussions with businesses, what I hear more of \u2014and this is something I think is a great aspect of a tight labor market \u2014larger firms are spending more on tr aining and trying to, given that they can\u2019 t hire workers with the ideal skills, are training people to fill jobs that they have available.  What I hear from CEOs of smaller    firms is that they don \u2019t have the ability to launch such programs.  They would real ly very much like to participate along , for example, with community colleges or nonprofits to see such programs launched and have jobs that people could fill if they received the appropriate training.  So I do think that this is an important area, and, especially given the pressures that have, you know, existed for a long time \u2014downward pressure on wages and job opportunities, especially for those with less skills \u2014I think that this is something that deserves priority. \n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 14, "dovish": 13, "neutral": 41}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 1, "dovish": 1, "neutral": 19}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 15, "dovish": 14, "neutral": 60}, "speech_summary": "The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by \u00c2\u00bc percentage point, citing progress in the economy towards maximum employment and price stability objectives.

Job gains have remained solid, although slightly slower than last year, and the unemployment rate has fallen to a low level.The recent lower readings on inflation are due to temporary reductions in certain categories of prices, but the Committee still expects inflation to increase and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years. Despite the softer recent inflation readings, the Committee is closely monitoring inflation developments.The FOMC expects gradual increases in the federal funds rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation, as the economy continues to make progress. While the neutral rate is currently low, it is anticipated to rise over time, leading to additional gradual rate hikes in the next few years to sustain economic expansion.The median path for the federal funds rate remains unchanged compared to previous projections. The Federal Reserve plans to implement a balance sheet normalization program this year, gradually decreasing reinvestments and reducing securities holdings.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has announced that any excess proceeds from the reduction of their securities holdings will be reinvested. They have also implemented caps on the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb, in order to prevent significant interest rate fluctuations and market strains.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) emphasizes the simplicity, efficiency, and control over the federal funds rate provided by the current operating system, which does not require active management of reserves. The Committee also states that reducing the balance sheet will not limit their options for implementing monetary policy in the future.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': With this latest rate increase, do you believe normalization is now well under way?\n'ANSWER': We have previously stated that \"well under way\" is not defined in quantitative terms but rather in qualitative terms. It is not solely based on the current level of the federal funds rate, but also on our confidence in the outlook and projections for the future path of the rate. We anticipate further rate increases this year and next, and if the economy continues as expected, we would begin the balance sheet wind-down this year.", "'QUESTION': Have you talked to the President or his staff about staying on as Chair for a second term? Would you consider doing that? Do you have any comment on the President's failure to nominate anyone for the three vacancies on the Fed?\n'ANSWER': I intend to serve out my term as Chair. I have not discussed future plans with the President. I hope there will be nominations for the open slots soon and that the Senate will address them promptly. I look forward to having a full Board.", "'QUESTION': Do you desire to stay on?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen responded, \"I really don't have anything for you at this point.\"", "'QUESTION': What kind of vigilance is needed in terms of weak inflation and how does it interact with the policy outlook? Would further disappointments argue for pausing rate hikes or delaying balance sheet runoff?\n'ANSWER': Monetary policy is not on a preset course. While we expect inflation to remain low in the near term, we believe that with a strong labor market, conditions are in place for inflation to move up. We will closely monitor inflation developments and make necessary policy adjustments as appropriate.", "'QUESTION': Any implications for beginning of runoff and further increases in the fed funds rate?\n'ANSWER': The economy is doing well with a strong labor market and low unemployment rate. Job growth may be moderating, but the labor market continues to strengthen. Inflation needs to reach the 2 percent objective, but the Fed will monitor data and adjust outlook if necessary.", "'QUESTION': Should the focus be on the change in actual inflation rather than the unobservable NAIRU when determining policy?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is closely monitoring actual inflation and adjusting their views based on discrepancies between expectations and reality. While it is difficult to determine the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, the Phillips curve suggests that inflation doesn't respond quickly to changes in unemployment. Despite low unemployment, wage growth remains low and there is no evident upward pressure on inflation. The Committee has lowered its estimate of the normal longer-run rate of unemployment to 4.6 percent.", "'QUESTION': How do you view the positive and negative risks from policy changes to your outlook, and has your view changed on that at all in the last six months?\n'ANSWER': Business and household sentiment remains strong, but the timing of expected policy changes has been pushed back. There is little evidence that expectations of policy changes have driven significant changes in consumer or investment spending. Business contacts remain confident and have a wait-and-see attitude.", "'QUESTION': Do you have the sense that the market is not listening to you? How much of a concern is that for you? And, at some point, does it convince you that you need to raise rates perhaps more quickly?\n'ANSWER': We take many factors into account when deciding the appropriate path of rates. While financial conditions may have loosened, we also consider the stock market and the value of the dollar. There is no simple relationship between financial conditions and our policy stance. We focus on generating paths for employment and inflation that meet our objectives.", "'QUESTION': What is the possibility that central bank credibility and globalization have pushed the world into a low-inflation environment that is difficult to reverse? Why not set the NAIRU lower than 4.2%?\n'ANSWER': The Fed's credibility has not been impaired, as indicators of inflation expectations remain steady and aligned with the 2% target. While some household surveys show lower inflation expectations, there is no broad undermining. Structural changes may have impacted inflation, and estimates of the normal unemployment rate are uncertain. Gradually removing accommodation is appropriate to sustain the expansion and avoid a rapid rate hike that could lead to a recession.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed's response to economists who disagree with the 2 percent inflation target and want a higher target?\n'ANSWER': The Fed adopted the 2 percent inflation target in 2012 after thorough discussion. They are currently focused on achieving this target, but recognize that assessments of the neutral federal funds rate have changed, potentially constraining policy. They are open to reconsidering the inflation target in the future, taking into account both potential benefits and costs. They welcome research by economists to inform their decisions.", "'QUESTION': How concerned are you about the gap between the Fed's projection of a 3 percent federal funds rate and the market's expectation of 2 percent, and what are the reasons for this disconnect?\n'ANSWER': It is difficult to determine the exact expectations embedded in market prices due to term premia. Expectations are based on estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, which have changed over time and are uncertain. The Fed has provided charts to show the range of uncertainty around their rate path. The current median stands at 3 percent, but many believe the neutral level is lower. The path of the rate remains uncertain and is being assessed by market participants and the Fed.", "'QUESTION': Do you see greater volatility in the markets as it adjusts to the difference in the gap between the expectation and what the Fed's projections are for the longer-run federal funds rate?\n'ANSWER': Our expectations are little changed and the market is aware of participants' views. It's important for the market to form its own views and interpret evidence on the economy. The gap between expectations and projections is not unhealthy, and our own views are likely to evolve over time.", "'QUESTION': If there is an adverse reaction in the financial markets to the trimming of bond holdings, will the FOMC make any changes to their plans?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC has been transparent about their intention to gradually and predictably reduce their balance sheet.

However, if there is a substantial reaction, they will consider adjusting their policy stance accordingly.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree that Dodd-Frank regulation has restricted credit growth and slowed economic growth? Would you support easing up on regulation if a new Vice Chair of Supervision wanted to do so? Do you agree with the characterization of being a \"low interest\" person?\n'ANSWER': I don't think our regulations have impeded credit growth and the economy. Credit growth remains healthy, especially among smaller community banks. Undercapitalized and weak banks impede credit growth, while strong banks are in a better position to lend. We believe in tailoring regulation to institutions and relieving burden for community banks.

There is no decision yet on raising rates and implementing the plan simultaneously, it depends on the outlook and assessment of conditions.", "'QUESTION': How much weight does the Federal Reserve give to the Treasury report's recommendations on potential regulatory changes, specifically regarding the Volcker rule?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is open to reducing the regulatory burden on community banks and exploring ideas to simplify the Volcker rule.

While there may be disagreements on details, the FOMC will pay attention to and review the suggestions made by the Treasury.", "'QUESTION': In light of the plans to trim the balance sheet, what have you learned about QE and bond-buying policies as tools for monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': QE has worked by putting downward pressure on long-term interest rates, without causing runaway inflation. It is a valuable part of the toolkit and would be considered in the future if short-term interest rates are constrained.", "'QUESTION': Is $4\u00c2\u00bd trillion the natural limit for the balance sheet or could it go higher if needed?\n'ANSWER': We haven't discussed pushing the balance sheet higher, our focus is on getting it back to a normal size. The use of QE in the US is not as high as in other countries, but we haven't seriously discussed it.", "'QUESTION': What is Chair Yellen's response to the budget cut to job training programs and the need for job training programs and apprenticeships to fix the job skills gap in the economy?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen does not comment on the President's budget, but she acknowledges the success of job training programs implemented by nonprofits and local authorities. She believes that there is a tight labor market where employers struggle to find workers with the right skills. Larger firms are investing more in training, but smaller firms lack the resources to do so and would like to participate in programs with community colleges or nonprofits. Chair Yellen emphasizes the importance of addressing the job skills gap, especially for those with less skills."]}
