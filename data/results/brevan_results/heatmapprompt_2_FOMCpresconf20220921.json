T hank you for taking our questions .  Jeanna Smialek from t he New York Times.  I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how    you\u2019ll know when to slow down these rate increases and how you\u2019 ll eventually know when to stop.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I will answer\u2014I will answer your question directly, but I want to start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole.  The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflati on down to 2 percent, and we will keep at it until the job is done .  So the way we \u2019re thinking about this is , the overarching focus of the Committee is getting inflation back down to 2 percent .  To accomplish that, we think we \u2019ll need to do two things , in particular:  to achieve a period of growth below trend;  and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in  the labor market.   So on the first, the Committee \u2019s forecast s and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer -run potential this year and next year .  On the second , though, so far there \u2019s only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off .  Job openings are down a bit, as you know ; quits are off their all- time highs ; there \u2019s some signs that some wage measures may be flattening out but not moving up;  payroll gains have moderated but not much.  And in light of the high inflation we \u2019re seeing, we think we \u2019ll need to\u2014and in light of w hat I just said, we think that we \u2019ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for some  time . So, what will we be looking at , I guess , is your question.  So we \u2019ll be looking at a few things .  First, we \u2019ll want to see growth c ontinuing to run below trend, we \u2019ll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand, and, ultimately , we\u2019ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent .  So that \u2019s what  we\u2019ll be looking for .  In terms of reducing rates, I think we \u2019d want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that .  \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  Steve Liesman, CNBC .  Can you talk about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates ?  Well, can you envision a time when there \u2019s a pause to kind of look at what has been wrought in the economy from the rate increases?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Sure .  So, of course , monetary policy does , famously , work with long and variable lags .  The way I think of it is , our policy decisions affect financial conditions immediately .  In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually announce our decisions .  Then , changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly, within a few months .  But it\u2019 s likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation.  So we are very much mindful for that .  And that \u2019s why I noted in my opening remarks that , at some point, as the stance of poli cy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation .  So that \u2019s how we think about that . Your second question\u2014sorry \u2014was?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Is there a point in time you could see pausing?  Is it linear?  Do  you keep raising rates, or is there\u2014oh, sorry , I should know better than to not talk with a microphone.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I should know better than to answer your second question.  [Laughte r\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Well , there you go.  Is it linear?  Do you keep raising rates , or is there a pause that you could envision where you kind of figure out what has happened to the    economy and give time to catch up in the real economy\u2014the rate increase time to catch up in  the real economy?  Thank you. \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I think it \u2019s very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold.  As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that\u2019 s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent, where we have confidence of that .  And what you see in the SEP numbers is people \u2019s views as of today, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate . Now, those will evolve over time , and I think we \u2019ll just have to see how that goes .  There is a possibility , certainly , that we would go to a certain level that we \u2019re confident in and stay there for a time .  But we \u2019re not at that level.  C learly , today we \u2019re, we\u2019ve just moved, I think, probably, into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive , and, certainly , in my view and the view of the Committee, there \u2019s a ways to go \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thank you for taking our questions .  The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4 percent next year, and, historically , that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a recession with it .  Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing, and is that kind of rise necessary to get inflation down?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Right .  So you\u2019 re right\u2014in the SEP, there \u2019s what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation.  Now, why is that?  So , really, that is what we generally expect because we see the current situation  as outside of historical experience in a number of ways , and I \u2019ll mention a couple of those .  First\u2014and you know these \u2014but first, job    openings are incredibly high relative to the number of people looking for work.  It\u2019 s plausible, I\u2019ll say , that job openi ngs could come down significantly\u2014and they need to\u2014without as much of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes .  So that \u2019s one thing.  In addition, in this cycle, longer -run inflation expectations have generally been fairly  well anchored, and , as I \u2019ve said, there \u2019s no basis for complacency there.  B ut to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability .  And I guess the third thing I would point to that \u2019s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we \u2019ve had, beginning with the pandemic , and, really , with the reopening of  the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia \u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2014have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation . So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles, and, in principle, if those things start to get better\u2014and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of that.  It\u2019s not much more than that, but it \u2019s good to see that .  For example, commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now ; supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve.   Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation.  So let me just say,  how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence of events \u2014it remains to be seen .  We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline \u2014or, rather , increase\u2014in unemployment and a soft l anding would be very challenging.  A nd we don\u2019 t know \u2014no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or , if so, how significant that recession would be .  That \u2019s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether  expectations remain anchored, and whether , also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well .    In addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer.  No netheless, we\u2019 re committed to getting inflation back down to 2 percent \u2014because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Just to follow up on one small thing\u2014are vacancies still at the top of your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Yes, vacancies are still almost  a 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people .  That and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, where , generally , the unemployment rate itself is the single best indicator .  We think those things have , for quite a time now, really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is .   MICHELLE SM ITH.  Nick \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal .  You said not too long ago, in describing the policy destination, there \u2019s still a way to go .  But I imagine you have to have some idea about how you\u2019 re thinking about your destination, w hether it \u2019s a stopping point or a pausing point .  And so I was wondering if you could discuss how you are thinking about, as the data come in, where that destination is, how it \u2019s moving up.  I f inflation doesn \u2019t perform as you expect, do you want to have a  policy rate that \u2019s above the underlying inflation rate, for example, and do you have an estimate for where you think the underlying inflation rate might be in the economy right now \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well , so, again, we believe that we need to raise our poli cy stance overall to a level that is restrictive\u2014a nd by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation.  That \u2019s what we need to see in the stance of policy .  We also    know that there are long and variable lags, particularly as they relate to inflation .  So it \u2019s a challenging assessment .  So, what do you look at?  You look at broader financial conditions, as you know ; you look at where rates are, real and nominal in some cases;  you look at credit spreads ; you look at financial conditions indexes . We also, I would think\u2014 and you see this in the \u2014this is something we talked about today in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings .  And you see this , I think, in the Committee forecast .  You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve.  And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we \u2019re writing down and think about \u2014you measure those against some sort of forward -looking assessment of inflation, inflation expectations .  I think you would see at that time \u2014you \u2019d see positive real rates across the yield curve , and that is also an important consideration.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Howard Schneider with Reuters .  Thanks for the opportunity.  I just want to be clear on the SEPs .  You say it \u2019s meeting by meeting, but it sure looks like we \u2019re going 75\u201350\u201325.  I s 75 next month the baseli ne\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So we make one decision per meeting , and the decision we made today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75  [basis points] .  You\u2019re right that the median for the year -end suggests another 125 basis points in  rate increases, but there \u2019s also, there \u2019s another fairly large group that saw a 100 basis points addition to where we are today.  So that would be 25 basis points less .  So we \u2019re going to make that decision at the meeting.  We didn\u2019 t make that decision today;  we didn\u2019 t vote on that .  I would say that we \u2019re committed to getting to a restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly , and that \u2019s what we \u2019re thinking about .  \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: So, just as a follow -up to that, I \u2019m wondering about the  sort of risk -management considerations here , given there \u2019s some discussion now of overdoing it .  What \u2019s the incentive to continue front -loading right now?   Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports?  Or is it a motivation to get as much d one while the job market is still as strong as it is\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, what we \u2019ve seen is, inflation has \u2014our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down, l argely because of supply- side healing .  By now we would have thought that w e\u2019d have seen some of that .  We haven \u2019t.  We have seen some supply -side healing, but inflation has not really come down.  If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3- , 6-, and 12- month trailing annualized basis, you\u2019 ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent . So that \u2019s a pretty  good summary of where we are with inflation .  And that \u2019s not where we expected or wanted to be .  So, what that tells us is that w e need to continue , and we can \u2014keep doing these, and we did today\u2014do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to .  And we \u2019re still discovering what that level is .  But people are writing that down in their SEP where they think policy needs to be .  So that \u2019s how we \u2019re thinking about it \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Colby Smith with  the Financial Times .  Chair Powell, how should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to target in 2025, and yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024?  And does that mean there \u2019s a level of inflation above the 2 percent target that the Fed is willing  to tolerate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025\u2014in the median \u2014and headline is at 2.0, so that \u2019s pretty close .  I mean , we write down our forecasts , and we figure out what  the    median is , and we publish it .  So it\u2019s not \u2014I mean , I would say that if, actually , if the economy followed this path, this would be a pretty good outcome .  But you\u2019 re right\u2014it is a tenth higher than 2 percent\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Okay .  Just as a quick follow -up:  I mean , if the concern is that underlying inflation is becoming more entrenched, perhaps , each month, then why forgo the more aggressive 100 basis point increase today, and does that risk having to do more later on?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Yeah .  So we, as we said at the last press conference and in between  that one  and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming in.  So, if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high reading for August .  So I think you have to\u2014you can\u2019 t really \u2014you never want to overreact too much to any one data point . So if you look at them together \u2014and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year \u2019s inflation, 3 -, 6-, and 12- month trailing, you see inflation is running too high.  It\u2019 s running 4.5 percent or above ; you don\u2019 t need to know much more than that .  If that\u2019 s the one thing you know, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down.

I would say it \u2019s not something we \u2019re considering right now and not something I expect to be considering in the near term .

A number of commentators have come to the view, including over at the World Bank, that simultaneous global tightening around the world is, creates a risk of a glo bal recession that \u2019s worse than is necessary to bring inflation down.  How do you see that risk?  How do you think of coordination with your fellow central bankers?  And is there much risk of overdoing it on a global level?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So we, actually , my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC colleagues and I , just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with other senior central bank officials from around the world .  We are in pretty regular contact, and we exchange, of course \u2014we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives\u2014in our case, the dual mandate, maximum employment  and price stability .  But we regularly discuss what we\u2019 re seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers, and it \u2019s a very  ongoing, constant kind of a process . So we are very aware of what \u2019s going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us, and vice versa .  The forecast s that we put together, that our staff puts together, and that we put together on our  own always take all of that \u2014try to take all of that into account .  I    mean , I can \u2019t say that we do it perfectly, but it\u2019 s not as if we don \u2019t think about the policy decisions \u2014monetary policy and otherwise \u2014the economic developments that are taking place in major economies that can have an effect on the U.S . economy.  T hat is very much baked into our own forecast and our own understanding of the U.S . economy, as best we can .  It won \u2019t be perfect . So I don\u2019 t see\u2014it\u2019s hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very different levels of interest rates .  If you remember, there were coordinated cuts and raises and things like that at various times , but, really, we \u2019re all, we \u2019re in very different situations .  But I will tell you, our contact is more or less ongoing, and it \u2019s not coordination , but there \u2019s a lot of information sharing.

Chair Powell, you talked about some ways the higher interest rates are affecting the economy, but we \u2019ve also seen a resilient labor market with durable consumption, strong corporate profits, and I \u2019m wondering what your s tory is on the resilience of the economy.  A fter all, you and your colleagues said, \u201cWell, we started tightening in March when we were talking about interest rates in the future .\u201d  And, indeed, Treasury rates moved up, so we should have had a lot of tighte ning taking e ffect.  Why is the economy, in your view, so resilient , and does it mean that we might need a possibly higher terminal rate \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You \u2019re right, of course \u2014the labor market, in particular , has been very strong.  But there are\u2014the secto rs of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are certainly showing the effects of our tightening , and , of course , the obvious example is housing,    where you see declining activity of all different kinds and house price increases moving down.  So we \u2019re having an effect on interest -sensitive spending.  I think, through exchange rates , we\u2019re having an effect on expo rts and imports .  I think \u2014so all of that \u2019s happening, but you \u2019re right, and we \u2019ve said this :  This is a strong, robust economy.  P eople have savings on their balance sheet from the period when they couldn\u2019 t spend and where they were getting government transfers .  There\u2019s still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum \u2014but still, some savings out there to support growth.  T he states are very flush with cash, so there \u2019s good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong economy.  Now, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year .  We think of trend as being about 1.8 percent , or in that range .  We \u2019re forecasting growth well below that, and most forecasters are.  But you\u2019 re right \u2014there \u2019s certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that .  And that \u2019s a good thing, because that means the economy will be more resistant to a significant downturn .  But , of course , we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2 percent .  We can \u2019t fail to do that .  I mean , if we were to fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve .  So for now, that has to be our overarching focus , and you see that, I think, in the SEP, in the levels of rates that we\u2019 ll be moving to reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in line with the SEP .  So that \u2019s how we think about it \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  In a world of euphemisms that we live in here, with \u201cbelow -trend growth\u201d  and \u201c modest increase in unemployment, \u201d I\u2019m wondering if I can ask you a couple of direct questions for the American people .  Do the odds now favor, given whe re    you are and where you\u2019 re going with interest rates, favor a recession ?  Four  point  four percent unemployment is about 1.3 million jobs .  Is that acceptable job loss?  And then, given that the data you look at is backward looking, and the lags in your policy are forward looking, and you don\u2019 t know what they are, how will you know, or will you know, if you\u2019 ve gone too far?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I don\u2019 t know what the odds are .  I think that there \u2019s a very high likelihood that we \u2019ll have a period of what I \u2019ve me ntioned is below -trend growth, by which I mean much lower growth, and we \u2019re seeing that now .  So the median forecast , I think , this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth.  So that \u2019s very slow growth.  And then below trend next year .  I think the median was 1.2, also well below .  So that \u2019s a slower, that \u2019s a very slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment .  But I think that\u2019s, so that is something that we think we need to have , and we think we need to hav e softer labor market conditions as well . We\u2019re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is this:  Inflation \u2014what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation .  And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us .  I wish there were a painless way to do that .  There isn \u2019t.  So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we\u2019re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that \u2019s what we \u2019re doing.  And we certainly don\u2019 t hope, we certainly haven\u2019 t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment .  Nonetheless,  we need to complete this t ask\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  But how will you know, or will you know , if you\u2019 ve gone too far?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  It\u2019s hard to hypothetically deal with that question.  I mean , again, our really tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy ra te up where it    needs to be .  And, as I said, you can look at this SEP as today\u2019 s estimate of where we think those rates would be .  Of course , they will evolve over time \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks .  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  I wanted to follow  up with what you just mentioned about the labor market .  You\u2019ve said several times that to have the labor market we want, we need price stability , and you suggested maybe there isn \u2019t a tradeoff in the long run.  But in the short run, there is a lot of concern , as people have been expressing here, about higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of rate hikes .  So can you explain, though, what about high inflation now threatens the  job market?  I mean, you seem to suggest inflation, high inflation, will eventually lead to a weaker job market .  So can you spell that out a little more for the general public on how that would work?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, for starters, people are seeing the ir wage increases eaten up by inflation .  So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck cycle, on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they\u2019 ve been going up, you\u2019 re in trouble right away .  You don\u2019 t have a cushion, and this is very painful for people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum .  So that \u2019s what we \u2019re hearing from people is , you know, very much\u2014that inflation is really hurting . So how do we get rid of inflation?   And, as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a way to just wish it away , but there isn \u2019t.  We have to get supply and demand back into alignment , and the way we do that is by slowing the economy.  Hopefully, we do that by slowing the economy, and we see some softening in  labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution from supply -side improvements , and things like that .  But none of that is guaranteed.      In any case, we, our job is to deliver price sta bility , and I think \u2014you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time.  We really saw that for a long time .  The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn\u2019 t move around much, and that was  enormously beneficial to the public that we serve .  And we have to get back to that and keep it for another long period of time .  To pull back from the task of doing that is, you\u2019re just postponing\u2014 the record shows that if you postpone that, the delay is only likely to lead to more pain .  So I think we \u2019re moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs , and that \u2019s what you see us doing.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you for taking the question, Mr . Chairman .  Edward Lawrence for Fox Busi ness.  So you had said that Americans and businesses need to feel some economic pain as we go forward.  How long from here should Americans be prepared for that economic pain?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  How long?   I mean , it really depends on how long it takes for wag es and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down.  And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that.  And I think once you\u2019 re on that path, that \u2019s a good thing.  And things will start to feel better to people \u2014they \u2019ll feel lower inflation, they \u2019ll feel that the economy is improving.  A nd also, if our projections are close to right, you\u2019 ll see that the costs in unemployment are, they \u2019re meaningful, and they \u2019re certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs .  And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot.  But, at the same time, we\u2019 d be setting the economy up for another long period\u2014 this era has b een noted for very long expansions .  We\u2019ve had three  of the four longest in measured    history since we got inflation under control .  And that \u2019s not an accident .  So when inflation is low and stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11\u201410- year, anyway, expansions , and you can see what we saw in 2018, \u2019 19, and \u2019 20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we \u2019ve seen since we started keeping track of that .  So we want to get back to that .  But, to get there , we\u2019re going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment , and that \u2019s going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  As a follow -up, what is that economic pain in your mind?  Is it job loss es?  Is it higher interest rates on credit cards?   What is that economic pain?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So it \u2019s all of those things .  Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve .  But they\u2019 re not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and doing it at a time when , actually , now people have really come to expect high inflation.  If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in  people \u2019s economic thinking about their decisions, then sort of getting back to price stability \u2014the cost of getting back to price stability just rises, and so we want to avoid that .  We want to act aggressively now and get this job done and keep at it unti l it\u2019s done \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chairman Powell .  Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business.  Existing home sales have fallen for seven months straight, mortgage rates are at their highest level since 2008, yet mortgage demand increased this week , and housing prices are still elevated .  Now, a t the end of your June press conference, you mentioned plans to reset the    housing market .  I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you mean when you say \u201c reset \u201d and what you think it will take to actually get there.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So when I say \u201c reset, \u201d I\u2019m not looking at a particular, specific set of data or anything.  W hat I\u2019m really saying is that we \u2019ve had a time of a red -hot housing market all over the country, where , famou sly, houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the ask, before even seeing the house .  That kind of thing.  So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand.  H ousing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level .  So the decel eration in housing prices that we \u2019re seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals , and that \u2019s a good thing. For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level \u2014at a reasonable pace\u2014and that people can afford houses again .  And I think we \u2014so we probably , in the housing market , have to go through a correction  to get back to that place.  There \u2019s also, there are also longer -run issues, though, with the housing market .  As you know, we \u2019re\u2014it\u2019s difficult to find lots now close enough to cities and things like that, so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and materials and things like that.  But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Just to follow, though, s helter made up such a large part of this hot CPI report that we saw .  Do you think that there is a lag and that we will see that come down in the coming months?   Or do you think that there \u2019s still this imbalance that needs to be addressed?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time .  We\u2019re looking for it to come down, but it \u2019s not exactly clear when that will happen .  So it may    take some time, so I think , hope for the best, plan for the worst .  So I think , on shelter inflation , you\u2019ve just got to assume that it \u2019s going to remain pretty high for a while . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Jean Yung with Market News.  You \u2019ve talked about the need to get real rates into positive territory , and you sa id earlier that policy is just moving into that territory now.  So I \u2019m curious, how restrictive is rates at 4.6 percent expected \u2014is that expected to be next year?  How restrictive?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  .  So I think if you look, when we get to \u2014if we \u2014let \u2019s assume we do get to that level, which I think is likely .  What you\u2019 re going to do is , you\u2019 re going to adjust that for some forward -looking measure of inflation.  And that could be \u2014you pick your measure .  It could be \u2014there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get \u2014but what you\u2019 ll get is a positive number .  In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term , I think, that are going to be, assuming that we \u2019re doing our jobs appropriately, that will be significant . So you\u2019 ll have a positive  [real] federal f unds rate at that point, which could be 1 percent or so, but \u2014I mean, I don \u2019t know exactly what it would be .  But it would be significantly positive when we get to that level .  And let me say, we \u2019ve written down what we think is a plausible path for the federal f unds rate.  The path that we actually execute will be enough.  It will be enough to restore price stability .  So this is something that, as you can see, they \u2019ve moved up, and we \u2019re going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether our policy is in the right place as we go.

Price stability is crucial for the economy to work for everyone and without it, sustained strong labor market conditions cannot be achieved. Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate and anticipates ongoing increases to be appropriate as they purposefully move towards a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. They are also continuing to reduce the size of their balance sheet.The US economy has experienced a slowdown from the high growth rates of 2021 due to the pandemic recession, with recent indicators showing modest growth in spending and production. Consumer spending has slowed, housing activity has weakened, and higher interest rates and slower output growth are impacting business fixed investment, while the global economic slowdown is restraining exports. Despite the slowdown, the labor market remains tight, with low unemployment rates, high job vacancies, and elevated wage growth, indicating a demand for workers that exceeds the available supply.The labor force participation rate has seen a slight increase in August but has remained relatively unchanged since the beginning of the year. FOMC participants anticipate that supply and demand conditions in the labor market will gradually improve, alleviating the upward pressure on wages and prices.Participants in the FOMC see inflation risks as weighted to the upside, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. However, there is a concern that prolonged high inflation could lead to entrenched expectations of higher inflation. The Fed is guided by its mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices, and is aware of the hardship high inflation imposes on individuals. They are committed to returning inflation to the 2 percent objective and will continue to monitor evidence of inflation moving down. The target range for the federal funds rate was raised at the meeting, and the reduction of the balance sheet is ongoing. The pace of future rate increases will depend on incoming data and the outlook for the economy.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has raised interest rates by 3 percentage points this year, but as monetary policy tightens further, they may slow the pace of increases to assess the impact on the economy and inflation. They will continue to make decisions meeting by meeting and communicate their thinking clearly, with the goal of restoring price stability and keeping inflation expectations anchored.Reducing inflation and achieving price stability are crucial for long-term maximum employment and stable prices, and the Fed is committed to doing everything possible to reach these goals, understanding the impact on communities, families, and businesses across the country.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': How will the FOMC know when to slow down rate increases and eventually stop?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC's main focus is bringing inflation down to 2 percent. They will monitor growth running below potential, labor market conditions, and evidence of inflation moving back down to 2 percent before considering reducing rates.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates? Can you envision a time when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pause to kind of look at what has been wrought in the economy from the rate increases?\n\n'ANSWER': Monetary policy works with long and variable lags. Our policy decisions immediately affect financial conditions, which in turn affect economic activity fairly quickly. However, it takes time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation. As the stance of policy tightens further, it will be appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes to assess the impact on the economy and inflation.", "'QUESTION': Is there a point in time you could see pausing? Is it linear? Do you keep raising rates?\n'ANSWER': I should know better than to answer your second question.", "'QUESTION': Is there a possibility of a pause in raising rates to assess the impact on the economy before continuing?\n'ANSWER': It is difficult to predict the exact path of rate increases. The goal is to raise rates to a level that will bring inflation down to 2 percent. The current projections may change over time, and there is a possibility of reaching a certain level and staying there for a period. However, we are not at that level yet.", "'QUESTION': Should we interpret the projected rise in the unemployment rate as a sign of no soft landing and is it necessary to bring down inflation?\n\n'ANSWER': The projected increase in the unemployment rate is relatively modest compared to historical episodes, given the expected decline in inflation. This is because the current situation is different in terms of high job openings, well-anchored inflation expectations, and supply shocks. The extent to which these factors will matter and the possibility of a recession depend on various factors like wage and price inflation pressures, expectations, and labor supply. The goal is to bring inflation back to 2 percent to avoid greater pain in the future.", "'QUESTION': Are vacancies still a top priority for understanding the labor market?\n'ANSWER': Yes, vacancies are still a valuable indicator of the tightness of the labor market, along with quits. In previous cycles, the unemployment rate was the best indicator, but vacancies and quits have been more informative in recent times.", "'QUESTION': How are you thinking about the policy destination and where it's moving up? If inflation doesn't perform as expected, do you want a policy rate above the underlying inflation rate, and what is the estimate for the underlying inflation rate currently?\n\n'ANSWER': We need to raise our policy stance to a level that puts meaningful downward pressure on inflation. Assessing this is challenging, but we consider broader financial conditions, rates, credit spreads, and financial conditions indexes. We also aim for positive real rates across the yield curve, aligned with forward-looking assessments of inflation and inflation expectations.", "'QUESTION': Is 75 basis points the baseline for the next month's rate increase?\n'ANSWER': The decision made today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points. The median for the year-end suggests another 125 basis points increase, but there is a group that sees a 100 basis points addition. The decision for the next meeting will be made then, with the goal of reaching a restrictive level for the federal funds rate quickly.", "'QUESTION': What is the incentive to continue front-loading right now?\n'ANSWER': Inflation has not come down as expected, with core PCE inflation at 4.8 percent. To reach the desired level, the Federal Reserve needs to continue with large increases and is still determining the appropriate level of policy.", "'QUESTION': How should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast to be back to target in 2025, and yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024? Does that mean there's a level of inflation above the 2 percent target that the Fed is willing to tolerate?\n'ANSWER': Core inflation is projected to be at 2.1% in 2025, which is close to the target. The forecasts are based on the median and if the economy follows this path, it would be a good outcome. However, it is a tenth higher than the 2 percent target.", "'QUESTION': Why did the FOMC not implement a more aggressive 100 basis point increase in interest rates and does this decision risk needing to do more later on?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC's decision is based on overall data, not just one data point. While there was a low reading in July and a high reading in August, looking at the year's inflation shows it is running above 4.5 percent. The Committee is committed to a restrictive policy stance until they are confident inflation is decreasing.", "'QUESTION': How will the slowing housing market and rising mortgage rates affect the Federal Reserve's plans for the balance sheet runoff?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is not currently considering selling mortgage-backed securities and does not expect to consider it in the near future. While they may turn to it eventually, that time has not come yet.", "'QUESTION': Will conditions in the housing market affect that decision?\n'ANSWER': The main thing is, we're not considering that decision, and I don't expect that we will any time soon.", "'QUESTION': How do you see the risk of simultaneous global tightening and the coordination with fellow central bankers? Is there a risk of overdoing it on a global level?\n'ANSWER': We are in regular contact with other central bank officials and exchange information on our domestic objectives and international spillovers. We consider the economic developments in major economies that can affect the US economy in our forecasts. While coordination is challenging due to different interest rates, there is a lot of information sharing and we are informed by other important economies.", "'QUESTION': What is the reason for the resilience of the economy despite higher interest rates and tightening measures?\n'ANSWER': The labor market has been strong, but sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as housing, are showing the effects of tightening. However, there are still significant savings and cash reserves that support growth. While growth is expected to be below trend, there is a possibility it could be stronger, which would make the economy more resistant to a downturn. The focus remains on getting inflation back to 2%.", "'QUESTION': Do the odds now favor a recession and is a job loss of 1.3 million acceptable?\n'ANSWER': There is a high likelihood of below-trend growth and slow growth in the coming years, which could lead to increases in unemployment. The goal is to address inflation and achieve a strong labor market, even though it may involve raising interest rates and potentially causing a modest increase in unemployment.", "'QUESTION': But how will you know, or will you know, if you've gone too far?\n'ANSWER': It's difficult to speculate on that question. Our main focus currently is on increasing interest rates to the appropriate level. The projections in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) provide an estimate of where we believe rates should be, but they will change as circumstances evolve.", "'QUESTION': What is the relationship between high inflation and the job market?\n'ANSWER': High inflation eats up wage increases, particularly affecting those with lower incomes. To combat inflation, the economy needs to be slowed down, which may lead to softening in labor market conditions. The goal is to achieve price stability, which has proven beneficial to society in the past. Delaying action on inflation only prolongs the pain.", "'QUESTION': How long should Americans be prepared for economic pain?\n'ANSWER': The duration of economic pain depends on how long it takes for wages and prices to decrease, leading to a decline in inflation. The Federal Reserve projects a significant decrease in inflation over the next two years, which will make people feel better as they experience lower inflation and an improving economy. However, this period of tight monetary policy is necessary to realign supply and demand and set the economy up for a long expansion.", "'QUESTION': What is the economic pain that the Federal Reserve is concerned about?\n'ANSWER': The economic pain includes higher interest rates, slower growth, and a softening labor market. However, the Federal Reserve believes that failing to restore price stability and allowing high inflation expectations to become entrenched would be even more painful in the long run. They aim to act aggressively now to avoid higher costs in the future.", "'QUESTION': What does Chairman Powell mean when he says \"reset\" in relation to the housing market and what is needed to achieve it?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Powell explains that the housing market needs to undergo a correction to address the imbalance between supply and demand and bring housing prices in line with market fundamentals. In the longer term, there are also challenges with finding suitable lots and resources for builders. Overall, the correction should help restore balance to the housing market.", "'QUESTION': Do you think shelter inflation will come down in the coming months or is there still an imbalance that needs to be addressed?\n'ANSWER': Shelter inflation is expected to remain high for some time and it is uncertain when it will come down. It may take some time, so it is best to hope for the best but plan for the worst. Therefore, it is safe to assume that shelter inflation will remain high for a while.", "'QUESTION': How restrictive is the expected 4.6 percent interest rate next year?\n'ANSWER': When we reach that level, it will be adjusted for forward-looking inflation measures, resulting in a positive real federal funds rate. The exact rate is uncertain, but it will be significantly positive and enough to restore price stability. The path of the rate will be determined based on incoming data and the evolving outlook."]}
