Thank you", "neutral"], [" Let me stop there", "neutral"], [" I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.", "neutral"]], "question_answer": [["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Chair Yellen, there was some debate going into this meeting about the phrase \u201cconsiderable time,\u201d and whether it would remain in the statement.  I want to know if you could tell me just a couple things about it.  First, was it debated at the FOMC as to whether or not it should be includ ed?  And, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019ve been over this before, but what does it mean timewise?  And that\u2019s just two questions.  I have ju st a couple more here.  Is the statement a form of forward guidance?  An d, finally, how do you square this idea of a date when you and others on the FOMC have continuous ly said that you\u2019re data dependent to the point where, if the data were to turn, would it not necessarily be a considerable time until you raise rates?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, of cour se, the Committee discussed its forward guidance today, and it discusses what the appropria te forward guidance is at every meeting.  This is part of our assessment of economic conditions and the appropri ate stance of monetary policy.  In terms of what the term \u201cconsiderable time\u201d means, th e Committee decided that, based on its assessment of economic conditions, that charac terization remains appropriate, a nd it was comfortable with it.  I think if you look, for example, at the projections of  individual participants that are revealed in the SEP\u2014well, that\u2019s the view of each participant, and, again, I\u2019d emphasize, not a Committee collective view\u2014there  is relatively little cha nge in the assessment of the outlook by participants between this meeti ng and the assessment in June.  So th e outlook is little changed\u2014a slight decline in the anticipated path of the unemploymen t rate and a very slight  uptick in the inflation projection, but really quite minimal.  So, the ou tlook hasn\u2019t changed that much from June, and the Committee felt comfortable with this characterization. Now, you said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this calendar-based guida nce?\u201d  I want to emphasize that there is no mechanical interpretation of what the term \u201cconsiderable time\u201d means.  And, as I\u2019ve said  repeatedly, the decisions that th e Committee makes about what is th e appropriate time to begin to raise its target for the federal funds rate will be data de pendent.  And in my opening comments just now, I again emphasized something I\u2019ve said prev iously, which is that if  the pace of progress in achieving our goals were to quicken, if it we re to accelerate, it\u2019s likely that the Committee would begin raising its target fo r the federal funds rate sooner th an is now anticipated and might raise\u2014might then raise the federal funds rate at a faster pace.  And the opposite is also true, if the projection were to change.  So there is no fi xed mechanical interpreta tion of a time period.   I think it would not be accura te to describe the Committee\u2019 s guidance about the timing of the federal funds rate and when it will move a bove zero as being calendar based.  The Committee has started with a broad general statement of wh at determines how long it will keep the federal funds rate target at zero.  It has said that it will be looking at  the actual and projected pace at which the gaps between our employment and infl ation, and our goals for those variables, are closing.  And then what the Committee does at ea ch meeting is\u2014after saying that the assessment will take into account many different indicators and take into account inflation pressures and other things\u2014it goes on to provide at that meeting its assessment of the im plications of its view of the data at that time.  And that assessmen t really hasn\u2019t change d over the last several meetings.  The Committee, based on its assessmen t at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying that, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to maintain the current target range for a consider able time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percen t objective.  So I wouldn\u2019 t describe that as\u2014I know \u201cconsiderable time\u201d sounds like it\u2019s a calendar concept, but it is highly  conditional, and it\u2019s linked to the Committee\u2019s assessment of the economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Howard Sc hneider with Reuters.  Thank you.  So if you would help us, I mean, square the circle a little bit\u2014because havi ng kept the guidance the same, having referred to signi ficant underutilization of labor, having actually pushed GDP projections down a little b it, yet the rate path gets steeper and seems to be consolidating higher\u2014so if it\u2019s data dependent, what accounts for the fa ster projections on rate increases if the data aren\u2019t moving in that direction\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, the grow th projections for 2014 are down a little bit, but the unemployment path is also marginally lower.  So  while the projected path of the labor market\u2014unemployment and other measures of the labor market\u2014of course is partly dependent on the growth outlook, it isn\u2019t totally dependent on th e growth outlook.  And the Committee assesses that the labor market is conti nuing to improve, and you see a sma ll reduction in the path of the unemployment this year and then over the rest of the projection period.   So, if you ask me\u2014you asked me, \u201cWhy has the projected funds rate path moved up?\u201d  Well, you know, each participant knows the reason th ey wrote down what they did.  But, as a guess, I would hazard\u2014first, I woul d say, there is relatively little  upward movement in the path, and I would view it as broadly in line with what  one would expect with a very small downward reduction in the path for unemployment and a very  slight upward change in the projection for inflation.  So, most participants, in deciding on the path, I think, look at, as our guidance says, how large is the gap between pe rformance of the labor market and that associated with our maximum employment objective, how large is the gap between inflation and our 2 percent objective, how fast will those gaps change.  And you see in the projections very modest reductions in the size of those gaps and modest\u2014ve ry small change of a slightly faster pace at which those gaps would change.  I would describe  the change in the projections, both for the  economy and the path of rates, as quite modest.  But the fact that they move does illustrate the data-dependence principle that I think is really so  important for market participants to keep in mind, that what we do will depend on how the data unfold.  There is uncertainty about that.  And as expectations and the actual performance of  the economy change, you should expect to see movements in the dots. I think it\u2019s also notable that the further you go out in the projection period, the wider the set of dots.  You see a big range out in 2017, and that reflects, in part , different forecasts by different members of the Committee about how rapid progress will be.  What you don\u2019t see in the dot\u2014so-called dot plot is also the uncertainty  that each individual, each participant, sees around their own projection.  So things will de pend on how the economy evolves.  That will change over time, and there\u2019s a good deal  of uncertainty a ssociated with it\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Madam Chai r.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Madam Chair, the economy has been growing now for five years, and some economists believe the expansion will last another five years.  W hy, in your view, is economic growth not creating more inflation in wages and in PCE?  Is this al l about remaining slack in the labor market, or are there other forces at play\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, to my mi nd, the very slow pace of wage increases does reflect slack in the labor market.  We had a very deep recession, as is perhaps to be expected in the aftermath of a very significant financial cr isis.  We\u2019ve faced headwinds in the economy recovering, so the recovery has be en slow.  Growth has been positive, and it\u2019s lasted for five years.  But it\u2019s nevertheless been slow relative to  past recoveries that have not been associated with financial crises.  And while unemployment has come way down from the slightly over 10 percent level it reached, at 6.1 percent, it remains significantly above the level that most  FOMC participants would regard as consistent with normal in the longer run, 5.2 to 5.5 percent.  So there is significant underutilizat ion of labor resources.  We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is  an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.  And, as I went into de tail in Jackson Hole and w on\u2019t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization\u2014high levels  that have come down only very marginally of part-time employ ment for economic\u2014or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of la bor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.  And so, I think there still is\u2014and the statement says it\u2014\u201csignificant underutilization of labor resources\u201d and a very modest pace of wage in creases that\u2019s picked up very little, I see as essentially a reflection of that\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, I want to come back to the interest rate projections  that the Fed put out today.  The public, I think, would be enlightened by knowing a bit more about where you stand in relation to these projections.  And with that in mind, and in th e name of transparenc y, I wonder if you could describe to us whether you\u2019re at the low end of those projections, within the central tendency, or at the high end.  I also want to ask you about a San Francisco Fed paper that came out recently, which suggested that market expectations have  been running below the Fed\u2019s own projections.  So I wanted to ask you if you see that as well, and whether it\u2019s at all troubling that market expectations might not be aligned with the central\u2014with what the Fed put out today\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, with respect to id entifying myself, the Committee has had discussions during the years that we have been pr oviding these forecasts of the participants to the public as to whether or not it\u2019s desirable fr om the standpoint of Committee functioning to identify who\u2019s who in these pictures.  And thus fa r, while occasionally an individual will indicate  in a speech what their personal views are, we ha ve not yet decided that it would be a desirable thing for the point of view of our decisionmaki ng process to identify individuals.  We have a subcommittee on communications that\u2019s now chaire d by Vice Chair Fischer, and they will be considering the SEP and whether or not some cha nges are appropriate.  Bu t until and unless there is some change in the Committee stance on this, I don\u2019t want to identify myself. You asked, second, about the San Francisco Fed paper that did point to a notable divergence between market views a nd the views of the Committee.  I\u2019d say that there have been any number of different analyses of this topic,  there are many different survey measures and interpretations of what the market thinks.  And I don\u2019t frankly think it\u2019s completely clear that there is a gap.  There are different views on whether or not such a gap exists .  To the extent that there is a gap, one reason for it could be that ma rkets and participants ha ve different views on the evolution of economic conditions.  For example, I think I\u2019d note that when the Committee participants write down their forecast for the fede ral funds rate, they are showing the funds rate path that they consider most likely.  Their ec onomic forecasts are of the conditions that they think are the most likely ones.  You don\u2019t see the full range of possibilities there.  And the path for the funds rate is the path that each individu al thinks is most likely.  Market participants, understanding that there are a range of po ssible outcomes, with upside and downside possibilities, are doing something slightly differe nt, I think, when they\u2019r e determining market prices.  They are taking into account the po ssibility that there can be different economic outcomes, including\u2014even if they\u2019re not ve ry likely\u2014ones in which outcomes will be characterized by low inflation or low growth a nd the appropriate path of rates will be low. So, differences in probabilities of different outcomes can explain part of that.  We, you know, want to learn, we\u2014market participants may have different views on the economy than the  Committee does, and that\u2019s something we want to try to infer and learn ma rket views, in part from information of this type.  What I can say is that it is important for market participants to understand what our likely response  or reaction function is to the data, and our job is to try to communicate as clearly as we can the way in which our policy stance will depend on the data, and I promise to try to do that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Ylan Mui, Washington Post .  My question is about the new exit principles.  You guys say that you don\u2019t plan to e nd reinvestments until after the first rate hike.  Can you give us a little bit of a sense of what are the condition s you\u2019re going to be looking for when you eventually begin to end the reinvestments?   It sounds like tapering the reinvestments is also on the table.  What might go into your deci sion on whether or not to end them altogether, whether or not to taper them?  And do you have  a general timeline for how long you think it will take to shrink the balance sheet once you actually start\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Okay.  All good questions.  So, I think the Committee would\u2014will be focused on\u2014we intend to use the path of short- term interest rates as our key tool of policy.  And, of course, market participan ts will be very focused, as we are, on what is the appropriate timing and pace of interest rate increases when  that time comes.  And I think the Committee would like to feel that it ha s successfully begun the normalization process and that we\u2019re successfully communicating with ma rkets about how that process wi ll be playing out over time.  And I think when the Committee is comfortable that  that process is established, is working well, and we\u2019re comfortable with the outlook, that they  will begin the process of ceasing\u2014or possibly tapering\u2014but eventually ceasing reinvestments. So, we say that it will depend on economic and financial conditions, but we want to make sure normalization is successfu lly under way.  If we were only to shrink our balance sheet by  ceasing reinvestments, it would probably take\u2014to get back to levels of reserve balances that we had before the crisis\u2014I\u2019m not sure we will go that  low, but we\u2019ve said that we will try to shrink our balance sheet to the lowest levels consistent with the efficient and effective implementation of policy\u2014it could take to the end of  the decade to achieve those levels\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: You said a few mo ments ago that there is perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor for ce participation as a result of cy clical factors.

And the second question\u2014in the statement of ex it principles, you said that the Committee will act as soon as economic conditions warrant.  Th ere had been an idea in circulation at some point that you might stay lower for longer as a means of compensating for some of the damage done during the recession.

By one technique that they used, th ey placed the estimate at \u00bc percent, but by another technique that they used it could be, I believe they  said, as large as 1 percent.  And so my own personal view is that there is some cyclical shortfall, and something certainly\u2014probably within that range.  But nevertheless, it\u2019s  a meaningful cyclical shortfa ll.  It\u2019s not completely\u2014so I\u2019m giving my own personal view, not a Committee assessment\u2014that, you know, I see the flat\u2014and given the underlying downward trend in labor force particip ation, we might interpret the flattening out of labor force par ticipation over the last year as  showing that that cyclical component has diminished somewhat.

Madam Chair, I want to come back to the forward guidance.  Quite a larg e part of the Committee has recently criticized the guidance as being calendar based.  But if I understood your comments earlier, that\u2019s not correct.  How should people understand it?  And if it doesn\u2019t have a defined meaning, what purpose is it actually serving?  And do you expect to  have to revisit it in the near future?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we are c onstantly discussing forward guidance and thinking about whether it\u2019s appropriate and how to revise it.  And we did do a major overhaul of our forward guidance in March.  I think the Committee part icipants who have spoken out on this topic recently want to make sure that we have the fl exibility\u2014that the Committee has the flexibility to respond to unfolding developments.  They want to ma ke sure that if progre ss really does turn out to be faster than we have\u2014we would expect, th at the Committee will be in a position to start sooner tightening monetary policy.  They do not wa nt to be locked into something that the markets see as a calendar-based and firm commitment.  And so they want to emphasize data dependence of our policy and make sure that we have appropriate flexibil ity.  But I agree with that.  And, as I said earlier, I think we do not ha ve any mechanical interpretation that applies to this.  It, of course, gives an impression about wh at we think will be appropriate, but there is no mechanical interpretation.  And I\u2019ve said repeat edly, and I want to say again, that if events surprise us, and we\u2019re moving more quickly to ward our objectives, and the Committee sees a need to move sooner or later depending on what th e data is, that we do f eel\u2014I do feel we have the flexibility to move.  And it is important fo r markets to understand that there is uncertainty, and this statement is not some sort of firm promise about a particular amount of time.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Good afte rnoon, Chair Yellen.  Getting b ack to the one aspect of the forward guidance is the statement, which you\u2019 ve reiterated about the funds rate probably needing to stay below normal for some time  after achieving mandate-consistent levels on unemployment, inflation, and so forth.  The SEP assessments of appropriate funds rate levels show the funds rate getting up to that 3.75 percen t normal level at the en d of 2017.  If you look at the SEP projections of unemployment, inflation, a nd so forth, they seem to get back to those mandate-consistent levels by the end of 2016, if not mu ch sooner.  So what is the justification for waiting that much longer to get back to normal, particularly when you have such a large balance sheet that you intend to reduce onl y gradually?  Is there a danger  of getting behind the curve? And, secondly, can I just ask, can you envision a time when, to reduce reserve pressures, you may have to resort to asset sa les that you don\u2019t anticipate doing now\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So on the first question of \u201csome time\u201d before rates return to normal levels, as I mentioned, you can see in the SEP that by the end of 2017, many participants are anticipating that rates will return to what they think ar e normal longer-ru n levels, but the economy, in their view, will have probably gotten back to normal levels of unemployment and near-normal levels of inflation sometime in 2016.  So that looks like a year or more in which rates would be below normal longer-run levels. We asked participants why they hold the view s that they do about appropriate policy, and there are a number of different e xplanations that participants give .  But a common view on this is that there have been a variety of headwinds resulti ng from the crisis that have slowed growth, led to a sluggish recovery from the crisis, and that  these headwinds will dissipate only slowly, that they are dissipating\u2014an example wo uld be the fact that mortgage credit really is, at this point, available really to those with pristine credit .  Credit conditions there are abnormally tight.   Another thing that we se e is that households\u2019 exp ectations about their likely income paths remain quite depressed relative to pre-crisis levels .  That\u2019s something that may be holding back consumer spending.  So the view would be that  those forces will dissipate over time, but only very gradually.  In addition, we have had slow  productivity growth, and a slow pace of potential output likely depresses the pace of investment sp ending.  And so, those are some of the things that participants mention as why it will take some time to get back. So the story is, it\u2019s not that the Fed is behind the curve in fa iling to return the funds rate to normal levels when the economy is recovered.  It is rather th at, in order to achieve such a recovery in 2016 or by the end, that it\u2019s necessary  and appropriate to have a somewhat more accommodative policy than would be normal in the absence of those headwinds\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Barnes of Fox Busi ness, ma\u2019am.  I would like to follow up on Greg\u2019s question about Europe, because to morrow Scotland is going to be voting on independence from Great Britain, and there\u2019s some  concern that if it do es vote to break from Great Britain, that this could cause some turmoil in global fi nancial markets and the global economy.

They made another reduction in asset purchases and maintained their accommodative stance, as the economy continues to make progress towards maximum employment.Despite a recent slowdown in job growth, the average monthly job gains over the past three months have exceeded 200,000. While there has been improvement in the labor market, there is still significant underutilization of labor resources and the economy is expected to continue growing at a moderate pace.The Committee expects inflation to gradually move back towards its 2 percent objective, as longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored and the economic recovery continues. Additionally, the likelihood of inflation persistently running below 2 percent has diminished, and the Committee will continue to assess incoming data to ensure policy consistency with its longer-run goals.The FOMC has projected that inflation will increase from 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014 to 1.9 to 2 percent in 2017. The Committee has decided to reduce the pace of asset purchases and will continue to monitor labor market conditions and inflation expectations before making any further changes to its policies.The FOMC anticipates that even after reaching mandate-consistent levels of employment and inflation, economic conditions may warrant keeping the federal funds rate below normal levels for some time. This guidance aligns with the participants' projections and the FOMC expects the federal funds rate to approach its longer-run normal level by the end of 2017 as the residual effects of the financial crisis continue to dissipate.The FOMC will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization to promote maximum employment and price stability, using nontraditional tools of monetary policy since the crisis. The Committee has been preparing for the normalization process and has released updated plans, intending to adjust the stance of monetary policy primarily through actions that influence the federal funds rate, not through active management of the balance sheet.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects that the federal funds rate may occasionally move outside of the target range, but this should not have a significant impact on the economy or financial conditions. The primary tool for adjusting the federal funds rate will be the interest rate paid on excess reserves, and the Committee will also use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility to help keep the federal funds rate within the target range.The Federal Reserve intends to hold only the necessary amount of securities, primarily Treasury securities, for efficient monetary policy implementation. The release of the Committee's updated normalization plans is not a signal of a change in monetary policy stance, but rather provides information on the process in light of recent economic and financial changes.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Was there debate about the phrase \"considerable time\" and what does it mean timewise? Is the statement a form of forward guidance? How does this square with being data dependent?\n'ANSWER': The Committee discussed forward guidance and decided that \"considerable time\" remains appropriate based on economic conditions. The term is not calendar-based and the timing of rate increases will be data dependent. The Committee's assessment of the economy determines the timing and it is highly conditional.", "QUESTION: What accounts for the faster projections on rate increases if the data aren't moving in that direction?\nANSWER: The projected path of the labor market is not solely dependent on the growth outlook. The Committee believes that the labor market is improving, with a small reduction in the path of unemployment this year. The slight increase in the projected funds rate path is in line with a small reduction in unemployment and a slight increase in inflation projections. The change in projections is modest and reflects the data-dependence principle. There is uncertainty in the economy, and as expectations and actual performance change, the projections will also change.", "'QUESTION': Why is economic growth not creating more inflation in wages and in PCE?\n'ANSWER': The slow pace of wage increases reflects slack in the labor market. The deep recession and slow recovery, along with underutilization of labor resources, have contributed to the modest wage increases. Other factors such as high levels of part-time employment and a shortfall in labor force participation also contribute to the underutilization.", "QUESTION: Can you clarify where you stand in relation to the interest rate projections and if market expectations align with the Fed's projections?\nANSWER: The Committee has not yet decided to identify individuals in the interest rate projections. There are different views on whether a gap exists between market expectations and the Committee's views. Differences in probabilities of different outcomes can explain part of the gap. It is important for market participants to understand the Fed's likely response to data.", "'QUESTION': What conditions will the FOMC be looking for when deciding to end or taper reinvestments and how long will it take to shrink the balance sheet?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC intends to use short-term interest rates as the key tool of policy and wants to successfully communicate the normalization process with markets. Once the Committee is comfortable with the process and outlook, they will begin the process of ceasing or tapering reinvestments. Shrinking the balance sheet to pre-crisis levels could take until the end of the decade.", "'QUESTION': Is it now the \"house\" view that labor force participation is essentially out of the equation when considering slack in the economy?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen asks for clarification on the first question, indicating uncertainty about whether labor force participation is considered in assessing slack in the economy.", "'QUESTION': The first question was.\n'ANSWER': Please.", "'QUESTION': Has the labor force participation changed?\n'ANSWER': Labor force participation has declined since the recession, partly due to demographic factors, but it is expected to stabilize as the economy improves.", "'QUESTION': Has labor force participation been removed from the slack equation?\n'ANSWER': The recent Brookings paper suggests that while there are structural reasons for declining labor force participation, there is still a cyclical shortfall. Estimates range from \u00c2\u00bc percent to 1 percent. While there is still some cyclical component, the flattening out of labor force participation over the past year suggests that it has diminished somewhat.", "'QUESTION': Is the debate about lower-for-longer essentially over?\n'ANSWER': The recovery has been slow and we have been using unconventional policies for a long time. We have been lower for longer than many standard policy rules would suggest. It will take some time for interest rates to return to normal levels, as projected by the end of 2017.", "'QUESTION': Do you see two dissents as a yellow-warning flashing light that policy may need to be moderated down the road? How should market participants read the dissents? Does it appear that potential is much lower than you thought, and therefore slack is closing more quickly than you thought?

Two dissents are not abnormal. Presidents Plosser and Fisher believe it is time to begin normalizing policy due to concerns about inflation and financial stability.

How concerned are you about events in Europe and especially the recent decline in inflation expectations there?\n'ANSWER': There has been a pattern of forecast errors where unemployment has come down faster than anticipated, but growth has consistently been lower than expected. This is due to disappointing productivity growth and downward revisions in potential output. The Committee's longer-run estimates are neither overly pessimistic nor overly optimistic.", "'QUESTION': What is the Committee's view on long-run growth and potential output?\n'ANSWER': The Committee has downgraded longer-run normal growth rates due to persistent forecast errors and disappointing productivity growth. There are a range of views on long-run growth, but the Committee's estimates are neither the most pessimistic nor the most optimistic.", "'QUESTION': How should people understand the forward guidance and what purpose does it serve? Will it be revisited in the future?\n'ANSWER': The Committee constantly discusses and revises forward guidance to ensure flexibility in responding to unfolding developments. The guidance is not calendar-based or a firm commitment, but rather emphasizes data dependence and allows for adjustments based on progress and market conditions. There is no mechanical interpretation, and if events surprise us, the Committee has the flexibility to move sooner or later towards its objectives.", "QUESTION: What is the justification for waiting longer to return to normal interest rates, especially when the economy is projected to reach mandate-consistent levels by the end of 2016?\n\nANSWER: The justification for waiting longer to return to normal interest rates is that there are still headwinds from the crisis that are slowing down the economy's recovery. These headwinds, such as tight credit conditions and depressed income expectations, are expected to dissipate gradually over time. Therefore, a more accommodative policy is necessary to achieve a full recovery by 2016.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about the impact of Scotland voting for independence on the global and American economy, and is the Fed doing anything to prepare for that possibility?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen does not want to weigh in on the topic of Scottish independence and its potential impact on the economy.", "'QUESTION': What are your views on whether a gradual approach to tightening is better than a more aggressive and less predictable one?\n'ANSWER': The Committee will have to discuss this when the time comes to normalize policy. While the predictable pace of 25 basis points per meeting may have contributed to diminished volatility, it is not the sole reason for the financial crisis. The Committee will consider whether a less mechanical pace would be better."]}
