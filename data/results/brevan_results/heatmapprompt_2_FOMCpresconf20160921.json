Madam Chair, critics of the Federal Reserve have said that you look for any excuse not to hike , that  the goalpost s constantly move.  And it looks , indeed , like there are new goalposts now  when you say looking for \u201c further evidence \u201d and\u2014and you suggest that it \u2019s evidence that labor \u2014labor market slack is \u201c being taken up.\u201d  Could you explain what \u201cfor the time being\u201d means , in terms of a time frame , and what that further evidence you would look for in order to hike interest rates?  And also, this notion that the goalpost s seem to move , and that you\u2019ve indeed introduced a new goalpost with this  statement.  Thank you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: I\u2019ll try to respond to those questions.  Let me try to set out again how the C ommittee sees the economy and what we\u2019 re looking for.  We\u2019 re generally pleased with how the U.S. economy is doing.  Growth was weak in the first half of the year ; we\u2019re seeing definite evidence that the economy is now expanding more strongly.  As I mentioned, payroll gains in recent months have been solid, averaging around 180,000 per month, which is less than the pace in 2015, but , as I mentioned, it \u2019s well above what \u2019s needed to provide jobs for new entrants into    the labor force over  time.  The unemployment rate is pretty close to most FOMC participants \u2019 estimates of its longer -run equilibrium value.  But , as I mentioned, that rate and other measures of labor utilization are little change d since the beginning of the year.  I don \u2019t see that as bad news, because it may reflect that the strong labor market is attracting people from outside the labor force back into employment.  The labor force participation rates increased on balance since late last year.  It has \u2014it is on a declining demographic trend, and the fact that it \u2019s increased shows a substantial number of people are being attracted into the labor marke t. The employment -to-population ratio has also continued to increase.  Now, we were not really certain that this is something that would happen as the labor market strengthened, a nd it\u2019s good to see that development has taken place.  And that is some news that we \u2019ve received in recent months , that the labor market does have that potential to have people come back in without the unemployment rate coming down.  So we \u2019re not seeing strong pressures on utilization suggesting overheating , and my assessment would be , based on this evidence , that the economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought .  That\u2019s good news.  Remember that inflation continues below 2 percent, although we expect it to move up over time.  So the Committee agrees that risks to the outlook have become roughly balanced.  We expect labor market conditions to continue strengthening.  And we are generally agreed that gradual increases in the federal funds rate to remove what is a modest degree of accommodation will be a ppropriate.  But we don\u2019 t see the economy as overheating now.  My colleagues and I exchanged views at this meeting on the appropriate timing of the next step in reducing policy stimulus.  Most of us judged that the case for an immediate increase in the fed eral funds rate is stronger, but that it would be sensible , given the finding of a bit more running room , to wait to    see some continued progress \u2014evidence that we continue to progress toward our objectives.  So, for the time being, we \u2019re going to watch incoming evidence , and you can see from the SEP that most participants do expect that one increase in the federal funds rate will be appropriate this year.  And I would expect to see that if we continue on the current course of labor market improvement and there are no major new risks that develop and we simply stay on the current course.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Chair, thanks for this.  I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the apparent tension between the stea dy drift down in the long -run rate and the steady drift down in some of the projections and the seeming march toward a rate hike.  If the neutral rate \u2019s coming down over time and continues coming down and you\u2019 re eating up accommodation that way anyway, why  not wait for the dust to settle on that before moving rates up \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So it is true that our estimates of the neutral rate are coming down , and that \u2019s what \u2019s largely responsible for that shift.  At the same time, we generally agree that the stance of monetary policy is somewhat accommodative.  So 180,000 jobs a month is a faster pace of employment growth than  is sustainable in the longer run.  Now, we have seen people come into the labor force and maybe more than would be expected, which is why the unemployment rate hasn \u2019t fallen.  But that \u2019s probably not something that is possible without the economy overheating on an indefinite basis.  So policy needs to be forward  looking.  We don\u2019 t want the economy to overheat and significantly overshoot our 2 percent inflation objective.  That\u2019s one risk that we need to address.  And I think we generally agree that some gradual increases to remove that accommodation will be appropriate if we stay on this course .      But, as I emphasized, it \u2019s not that much accomm odation, and the economy has shown evidence that there are more people who are being attracted back into the labor force.  So , in that sense, I would characterize it as , we found the economy has a bit more running room .  Nevertheless, we don \u2019t want the economy to overheat , and if things continue on the current course, I think that some gradual increases will be appropriate.  And, mainly , what we discussed today were issues affecting the timing of such increases.  MART IN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press.

So I think most of my colleagues agree\u2014agree with that assessment.  I think we a re trying to understand some difficult issues.  There is less disagreement among participants in the C ommittee than you might think, listening to speeches and commentary.  I think we all agree that the economy is making progress , that  we are close to an unemployment rate that is one that \u2019s sustainable in the longer run.  We all agree we are undershooting our inflation goal , and that we want to make sure we stay on a course that raises that to 2 percent.  And we \u2019re struggling with a difficult set of issues about what is the \u201c new normal \u201d in this economy and in the global economy more generally , which explains why we keep revising down the rate path.  And, you know, it \u2019s very important    that in a body like ours that a whole range of views a re expressed , that we have independent -minded people who gather together and discuss these issues.  My colleagues do explain , in their individual speeches , their own perspectives.  These are complicated , complex issues , and it just isn\u2019t straightforward ex actly how to interpret what is appropriate policy and exactly what is going on in the economy.  My \u2014my  sense is that market participants and the public more generally learn more about the issues that we\u2019 re grappling with as they listen to th is set of speech es.  And I think it \u2019s a very good thing that the FOMC is not a body that suffers from groupthink.

And we are debating and discussing issues pertaining to timing.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee , has charged that the Fed is keeping interest rates artificially low to support the Obama A dministration.  I\u2019d like to hear what you have to say to that charge.  And, on a related note, I wanted to ask you about the Fed \u2019s next policy meeting , which is in e arly November , a week before the next election \u2014given that the case for raising rates , you say today , has strengthened, should the public see that November meeting as a live meeting when a rate action could happen?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I think C ongress very wisely established the Federal Reserve a s an independent agency in order to insulate monetary policy from short -term political pressures.  And I can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate s tance of monetary policy.  We are trying to decide what the best policy is to foster price stability and maximum employment and to manage the variety of risks that we see as    affecting the outlook.  We do not discuss politics at our meetings , and we do not take politics into account in our decisions. As I said, we \u2019re generally pleased with the progress of the economy.  And the decision not to raise rates today and to wait for some further evidence that we \u2019re continuing on this course is largely based on the judgment that we \u2019re not seeing evidence that the economy is overheating , and that we are seeing evidence that people are being drawn in \u2014in larger numbers than at least I would have expected \u2014into the labor market , and that that \u2019s healthy to continue , but th at, nevertheless, we do need to be forward looking.  And if we continue along this course, it likely will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate.  And November you asked about as well.  Well, every meeting is live , and we will again assess , as we always do , incoming evidence in November and decide whether or not a move is warranted.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Madam Chair, Craig Torres from Bloomberg.  What observable data would convince you and the C ommittee that this neutral federal funds rate is starting to move up?  There\u2019 s a popular piece of research by one of your colleagues that suggests that it \u2019s at zero right now.  And , second, I \u2019m struck by your opening remarks that the economy is \u2014isn \u2019t overheating .  But does \u2014does that mean the C ommittee sees this global reach -for-yield going on right now as very low  cost to its policy?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So you asked, first :  What evidence would suggest that the neutral real rate is moving up ?  Well, I think if you saw us revising up our growth forecast s, revising down our estimates , well, with an unchanged path for policy, you know , if you saw this, you would see revisions in the funds rate path.  But if unemployment were moving down faster than we had anticipated , if we saw faster growth or upward pressure on inflation, that would be suggestive of the appropriateness of reevaluating whether or not the neutral funds rate had    increased.  I mean, the downward revisions reflect the fact that , while the economy has made a lot of progress, it \u2019s only made that progress in the context of a monetary policy that has been characterized by extremely low interest rates and negative real yields for a very long period of time.  Let\u2019s see, and then you asked about global factors.  So global factors, capital flows \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: \u2014about the global reach -for-yield and whether the C ommittee saw that as a cost to its accommodative policy right now.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, in most advanced nati ons now, we have highly accommodative policies , and they seem to be necessary for countries to be able to achieve their inflation and employment objectives.  And that \u2019s characteristic of a \u2014an environment in which the neutral rate\u2014interest rates both here and in advanced countries around the globe appear to be very low.  And that is an environment that, if we do have to live with that for a long time, we have to be aware that it does give rise to a reach for yield as individuals and investors seek to, perhaps, take on risk or lengthen maturities to seek higher \u2014to seek higher yields.  And I think we should be concerned about that to the extent it creates financial stability risks.  And we are very aware that those are possible.  We engage in regular assessments  of financial stability factors that bear on financial stability.  Overall, I would say that the threats to financial stability I would characterize, at this point, as moderate.  Not \u2014I mean \u2014so, I would characterize it as moderate.  In general, I would not s ay that asset valuations are out of line with historical norms, but there are areas my colleague President Rosengren has focused on:  commercial real estate, where price- to-rent ratios are very high or cap rates are very low.  And that \u2019s something that has caught our attention.  We have a variety of tools other than monetary policy to address such risks.  We\u2019ve recently issued new supervisory guidance pertaining to commercial real estate.  I would    say, in the area of commercial real estate , while valuations are high, we are seeing some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real estate prices.  But , more generally, we\u2019 re not seeing signs of leverage building up or maturity transformati on in the way that we saw in the run -up to the crisis , and we \u2019re keeping a close eye on it\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  Two quasi -related questions.  One, Bill Dudley earlier this year suggested that political uncertainty in the U .S. may be one of the depressants on business investment at the moment.  I wondered if you\u2019 d seen any furt her evidence that election risk  was one of the reasons that business es are holding back at the margin. A second was a follow -up on your Jackson Hole sp eech where you presented a fairly optimistic sense of the scope for further monetary  stimulus.  You did raise the question of automatic stabilizers  in the U.S., however .  Are you concern ed that there is in sufficient fiscal backup to the F ed, and too much is effectively being lumped on the shoulders of the central b ank if there is a fresh downturn?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, starting with the issue of political uncertainty and investment, investment spending really has  been quite weak for some time, a nd we \u2019re really not certain exactly what is causing that.  Part of it, of course, has been the huge contraction in drilling activity associated with falling oil prices, but the weakness in investment spend ing extends beyond\u2014beyond that sector, a nd I\u2019m not cer tain of exact ly what explains that, whether \u2014I\u2019m not aware of evidence that suggest s that it\u2019 s politica l uncertainty, but it certainly \u2014I would agree with the finding that it has been weak.  Consumer sentiment is perfectly solid.  We \u2019re seeing a lot of stren gth in consumer spending, and consumer sentiment certainly seems to be solid.    You asked about scope for further monetary policy action.  I was careful in Jackson Hole .  I indicated we have a number of tools that we \u2019ve used before and could use again.  I did indicate that I do have concerns about the scope for monetary policy.  N evertheless , at this po int our balance sheet is large, and we\u2019 re not at what we see a s the normal level \u2014longer -run level of interest rates.  S o, at the mom ent, the funds rate is very low.  It\u2019s below that normal level.  So , at the moment , I would say the zero lower bound is a concern, and we have less scope  than I would like to see or expect us to have in the longer run.  Now, I think it would be \u2014it would be  worthwhile for other policy makers to think about what role they could play  in addressing negative shocks should they come .  And I mentioned specifically automatic stabilizers because I think that \u2019s an important way in which fiscal policy serves to  cushion shocks to the economy .  And it would seem to me, without getting into specifics, that there are ways in which the response of fiscal  policy to shifts in the economy could be strengthen ed, which would help take s ome burden off monetary policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News.

And in terms of our overall supervisory responsibility for Wells and ot her large banking organizations, we are very focused , and this will be a particular focus of our supervision going forward over the next year or so on the compliance environment to make sure that the contr ols, that the senior management oversight, that the involvement of the boards of directors are appropriate to control these kinds of  risks.   We have been distressed to see banking organizations responding when a pa rticular problem arises, a nd what we \u2019d really want to see is robust procedures that ensure that employees are always acting in a legal and ethical manner , and that the incentives that are put in place in these organizations are appropriate and don\u2019 t serve to foster behav ior that could harm the public .

Back to a question about Wells or related to Wells.  One of the con cerns that has been raised \u2014that this scandal has    raised \u2014is that the bank itself says it doesn \u2019t know what was happening, a nd there are thousands of employees that were involved in this.  Some are calling for a breakup, saying that the banks are too big to manage.  Do you think that \u2014leaving aside the question of Wells specificall y, do you think that it \u2019s possible for a bank to get so big that it can\u2019 t be managed , and that perhaps the best prudential step would be to break it up?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we have hig h expectations for what we expect to  be in place in a large organization or in any banking organization.  We expect there to be robust systems of risk management, strong audit functions, a board of directors that is monitoring and supervising and holding s enior management accountable for things that happen throughout the organization in a strong c ompliance environment, a nd I don\u2019 t think that these are impossible standards to meet .  They may be challenging , but I wouldn\u2019 t at this point arrive at the conclusion that just because an organization is large , it can \u2019t live up to those standards .

I have a question about the rate trajectory  the Fed outline d today in the dot  plot.  While there is clearly a wide range, the median expectation is for the fed funds  target  to rise by \u00bd percentage point in 2017, \u00be of a point in 2018, and a further \u00be of a point in 2019, bringing us to 2\u00bd to 2\u00be percent , and then 2\u00be percent to 3 percent  in the long run.  At the same time, the    median forecast for  GDP growth is 2 percent for the next two years  and 1.8 percent  thereafter.  And, I should add, the most optimistic proje ction is for growth of just 2\u00bd percent  of all the projections outlined here.  So if economic growth is going to be that slow for that long, where will the inflationary forces emerge that would require tightening of 250 basis points from where we are now?  And if not inflation, is there some other explanation?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So the projections \u2014I agree , the projections for growth are slow.  We have further written down our estimate of the longer -run normal gro wth rate.  And what that reflects is  an assessment that productivity growth is likely to remain low for an extended time , although it does  embody an  expectation that it will pick up from the miserable \u00bd percent pace per year that we have seen over the last five years.  Now, why we would never \u2014and slow growth is a factor.  Slow productivity growth is a factor that influences the longer -run normal level of interest rates , and writing down the likely pace of productivity growth is one factor that is responsible for the downward shift in the path that you see for the federal funds rate.  That \u2019s an important reason for revising down the neutral rate. But now, let \u2019s go to your \u2014the part of your question about inflation.  In spite of having such slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated a n average of about 230,000 jobs a month a nd so far this year has been generating about 180,000 jobs a month.  And that is a  very solid pace of job growth and a pace that likely is not sustainable in the longer run, a lthough we \u2019ve been pleased to see people come back in the labor market.  So it certainly is sustainable for some further amount of time.  But I think what ultimatel y drives inflation, both wage and price growth, is that tightness in the labor market and pressure on resource utilization.  And the sad fact is that we are getting    that healthy pace of job market growth with very slow growth in output.  So this is \u2014I don\u2019 t think it bears on the inflation outlook.  I t has prompted a downward shift in the projected path for the neutral and actual federal funds rate, but it is a huge concern because slow productivity growth ultimately means slow growth in living standards.  An d that \u2019s a big concern that policymakers should be focused on.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  Back to Wells Fargo .  You know, obviously, this was more of a consumer finance kind of a question, but I \u2019m wondering if you think it does pos e safety and soundness questions, if  something like this is widespread ac ross a big bank.  And you had  mention ed that this is going to be a supervisory focus over the coming year.  Are there any adjustments that you can speak to that might be warranted , given these revelations?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, as I mentioned, we are going to be focusing on compliance ris k management and board oversight  not only  at Wells, but also across bank holding companies.  Of course, consumer issues and issues that involve harm of consumers can become safety and soundness issues.  And if there was \u2014at least one of the lessons from the financial crisis , I think, is that abuses of consumers of the  sort that we see \u2014saw in subprime lending ultimately did become\u2014become safety and soundness issues.  And so, of course, we need to have that concern, and we \u2019ll focus there.  I think\u2014 I can \u2019t really at this point give you specifics beyond that\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires.  A large number of congressional Democrats a s well as the campaign of Hillary Clinton would like bankers removed from the boards overseeing the regional F ed banks.  Also, other reformers would like to see the private ownership of the regional \u2014the bank ownership of the regional Feds ended and that the    regional F eds be brought fully into government , and I wanted to know what you thought of those two proposals\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we have a system that Congress did set up in the Federal Reserve Act in which the governance of the Reserve B anks involves banks contributing capital and serving on the boards of directors.  We have long recognized inside the Federal Reserve that when we \u2019re charged with supervision of banks , having banker s involved in that obviously presents conflict of interest.   And we have put in place very strong measures to ensure that those conflicts of interest are not allowed to play out in any \u2014in any way, that bankers are not allowed to be involved in supervision.  Dodd- Frank changed the arrangement so that only the C lass B and C, or nonbanking , directors can participate in the selection of the president as well.  So I think\u2014 I want to make sure the public has confidence that , in spite of the fact th at we do have this banker involvement in our boards of directors , that it is  not giving rise to any conflicts in our actual conduct of policy.  Now, that setup\u2014if that setup is changed, it raises  which \u2014it\u2019 s up to Congress to decide what to do here.  It raises complex issues about the governance \u2014the whole governance arrangement in the R eserve Banks in the Federal Reserve, and I would simply caution that if that is looked at, as Congress is entitled to do, that they think through carefully what the ramifications of making changes would be.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Karen Mracek  with Market News International.  You mentioned in a previous answer the need to be forward looking , but you\u2019 ve also pointed to the economy not overheating as a reason you could, you know, hold off on raising rates at this one.  Monetary policy ha s traditionally operated with long and variable lags.  Do you think this timeline has changed since the financial crisis or due to the u se of unconventional tools that the F ed used , and how does that factor into your decisionmaking?   \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I think the notion that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags \u2014that statement is due to Milton Friedman , and it is one of the ess ential things to understand about  monetary policy , and it ha s not fundamentally change d at all.  And that is why I believe we h ave to be forward  looking , and I \u2019m not in favor of a  \u201cwhites of their eyes \u201d sort of approach.  We need to operate based on forecasts.  But the global economy and the U .S. economy have changed a lot.  History doesn \u2019t always exactly replay itself.  Many of th e\u2014those of us sittin g around the table, we learned the  lesson that if policy is not forward  looking, that inflation can pick up t o highly undesirable levels , that inflation expectations can be dislodged upward, and the consequence of that can be that, endemically , higher inflation takes place , which \u2014it is very costly to reduce.  And absolut ely none of us want to relive a n episode like that.  And so I believe , and my colleagues , that it is important to be forward  looking.  We \u2019re not going to make that mistake again.  But the structure of the economy changes, things do change.  The nature of the inflation process ha s changed , I think , significantly  since the bad days of the \u2019 70s when the Fed had to face this chronic high -inflation  problem.  We \u2019ve seen infl ation respond less to the economy, to movements in the unemployment rate \u2014that \u2019s sometimes sa id, \u201cThe Phillips curve has become flatter. \u201d  So we \u2019ve seen less of a response .  That\u2019s something we need to factor into our decisionmaking.  Inflation expectations  appear to be better anchored, and perhaps that \u2019s been a result of a long period of low and stable inflation.  That\u2019s an asset .  It\u2019s something we didn\u2019 t have in the 1970s.  And , in addition, we have to be attentive to the fact there we \u2019ve now had a long period in which inflation is actually undershooting our 2 percent  objective.  And we see some signs that I \u2014we conclude  inflation expectations are reasonably well  anch ored at 2  percent.  But we are seeing signs suggesting possible slippage there , and we \u2019re a long way from being \u2014facing    the problems that Japan faces.  But there always a remi\u2014should be a reminder to us that we also would not want to find ourselves in a period where inflation is chronically low\u2014running below our objective , inflation expectations are slipping .  And with a low neutral rate , that becomes more important.

Chair Yellen, you just mentioned one of the economy \u2019s major problems :  low productivity growth.  And one of the solutions that \u2019s been proposed widely is better job skills.  Many economists  say that some workers are staying on the sidelines because they don\u2019 t\u2014they, you know, they lack new job skills, the ones that would help them obtain better employment.  The Fed doesn \u2019t have the authority to finance or run its own  job training program or apprenticeship, but would you want that authority from Congress ?  And is it at all frustrating that you know \u2014you and your colleagues know one of the solutions to fixing a major issue in the economy , but you can\u2019 t take the concrete steps to solving that issue \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well , I do think job training and job skills are important.  And we do work in community developme nt, trying to \u2014in the local  communities where the Reserve B anks operate, to try to foster broader understanding of what kinds of programs work and how community organizations in state and local governments can put in place programs that will be helpful.  I\u2019ve recently visited a program that was very impressive in Philadelphia .  I\u2019ve visited some in Chicago and other places.  So I do believe it \u2019s possible to design programs that will help people overcome obstacles in getting jobs that are available.  But I de finitely think that, you know, while we can play some role in facilitating understanding of what works and what doesn \u2019t work that can be helpful, it \u2019s certainly worthwhile for policymakers at the federal level, at state    and local levels , to be focusing on this , becau se I think it is an area that would be helpful in making progress\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Madam Chair, Mark Hamrick with B ankrate.com.

Job gains have remained solid, but measures of labor market slack have shown little change. However, more people are actively seeking and finding jobs, which is a positive development for individuals and the nation as a whole. Overall, labor market conditions are expected to strengthen further over time.Ongoing economic growth and an improving job market are supporting the inflation outlook, but overall consumer price inflation remains below the 2 percent objective due to previous declines in energy and import prices. However, as transitory influences fade and the job market strengthens, inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the next two to three years.The FOMC projects a lower growth rate of 1.8 percent for inflation-adjusted GDP this year due to weaker-than-expected growth in the first half. However, the growth projection for 2017 and 2018 remains unchanged at 2 percent, slightly higher than the estimated longer-run normal growth.

The Fed believes there is still room for the economy to grow and expects gradual rate increases. They will continue to monitor incoming evidence before making a decision.", "QUESTION: Can you comment on the tension between the decreasing neutral rate and the potential rate hike?\nANSWER: Our estimates of the neutral rate are decreasing, but we still believe that monetary policy is somewhat accommodative.

And does the Committee see the global reach-for-yield as a low cost to its policy?\n'ANSWER': If there are revisions in the growth forecasts, downward revisions in estimates, faster-than-anticipated decline in unemployment, faster growth, or upward pressure on inflation, it would suggest reevaluating whether the neutral funds rate has increased. The downward revisions reflect progress made in the context of low interest rates and negative real yields.

However, any changes to the current setup would raise complex issues regarding the governance arrangement, and Congress should carefully consider the ramifications before making any changes.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the timeline for monetary policy has changed since the financial crisis or due to the use of unconventional tools, and how does that factor into your decision-making?\n'ANSWER': The timeline for monetary policy has not fundamentally changed, but the global and U.S. economies have changed. We need to be forward-looking and operate based on forecasts. The nature of the inflation process has changed significantly since the 1970s, with inflation responding less to the economy. Inflation expectations are better anchored now, but we need to be attentive to signs of slippage. The principle of being forward-looking still holds.", "'QUESTION': Would the Fed want the authority from Congress to finance or run its own job training program?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen believes job training and skills are important and the Fed works in community development to foster understanding of effective programs. While the Fed can play a role in facilitating understanding, it is important for policymakers at all levels to focus on job training to make progress.", "'QUESTION': Is there better news on the horizon for wage growth and when can we expect it?\n'ANSWER': There has been a modest pickup in wage growth, running higher than the last two years. Income growth has also increased, with more jobs and higher-paying jobs benefiting families. The expectation is for further decline in unemployment rate and improvement in labor market conditions, leading to a further pickup in wage growth that will benefit American households."]}
