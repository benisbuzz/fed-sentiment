[["\nREPORTER: I\u2019m Marty C rutsinger, Associated Press.  Ma dam Chair, could you give us any insight int o the discussion and how it de alt with the major tax changes that Congress is considering now?  T here have been thoughts that wit h these changes happening at a time when the economy is already\u2014with unemployment so low\u2014that the Fed may be forced to increase its pace on rate hikes .  Did any of that discussion co me up in your meeting\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, yes, we did di scuss tax policy, and let me s ay that most of my colleagues factored in the prospe ct of fiscal stimulus along th e lines of what\u2019s being contemplated by Congress into the ir projections.  Now, I should  emphasize that some have been incorporating those expectations  into their projections through out the year, so changes to the projections that you see since Se ptember should not be viewed a s an impact\u2014an estimate of the impact of the tax package.  And, i n particular, broader expecta tions of changes to fiscal policy have been reflected in financi al market conditions, I think, ov er the past year.  For example, we have seen a significant increase in the stock market, and at le ast some portion of that, I would judge, likely partly reflected e xpected tax changes, and that e ffect\u2014along with other financial market effects, which affects, f or example, projected consumer spending and would have affected wealth\u2014that\u2019s been part  of participants\u2019 forecasts now  for some time.  I think my colleagues and I are in line wit h the general expectation among  most economists that the type of tax changes that are likely t o be enacted would tend to provide  some modest lift to GDP growth in the coming years, and you see that\u2014in part, that\u2019s one of th e reasons, I think, for the uptick you see in estimated growth and decline in the unemployment rat e.   The views of participants, I believe, have been informed by a w ide range of analysis, including that of the Joint Committee on Taxation and other out side evaluators, and my sense is that their estimates are essentially in the same ballpark, alth ough they recognize, as I emphasized, that there is consid erable uncertainty about the im pacts, and that will have to be monitored over time.  More spec ifically, they t end to see the p ackage as boosting both consumer spending and capital spending, to some extent. Now, to the extent that the c hanges do have positive impact on the growth of potential GDP and longer-run growth, let me just say that this is somethi ng that, should it occur, would be very welcome to participants, as long as it\u2019s consistent with t he attainment of our employment and inflation objectives.  I gue ss I would also urge you to rem ember that when you look at the projections, that there are ma ny factors that affect those proj ections, and changes in tax policy\u2014that\u2019s only one of a number of f actors, including incoming data  that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth and infla tion.  All of tha t factors into  the projections you see. But I think, bottom line, whe n you look at assessments of the f unds rate path, participants continue to see gradual increases  in the target r ange for the f ederal funds rate as being appropriate to sustain a strong l abor market and bring inflatio n back to 2 percent.  And, look\u2014importantly, there is a lot of uncertainty about what the likel y effects will be, and my colleagues and I will be committed, as alwa ys, to evaluating incoming data  and altering the outlook as appropriate\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Harriet  Torry with Dow Jones Newswires.  You an d others at the Fed have said that soft infla tion should be transitory.  Are yo u confident that tha t will still be the case, particularly regarding wag e gains?  They\u2019ve been pretty m oderate in recent months, yet the   economy is growing and confiden ce is high.  Is there something going on in the economy that\u2019s making it difficult for businesses to raise wages\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So it is true that i ncoming wage data suggests o nly modest upward pressure on wages.  That leaves  me\u2014that\u2019s one factor, along wit h the fact that inflation remains low\u2014with feeling that even though we have a 4.1 percent unemplo yment rate, that the labor market is not overheated at thi s point.  Remember, the modest p ace of wage gains also probably reflects slow productivity growth.  But when you ask me about t he outlook for  inflation, you know, I\u2019ve talked in detail abou t this in the past and recogniz e that there is uncertainty about what\u2019s holding inflation down.  But  my colleagues and I continu e to believe that th e factors that are responsible this year for hol ding inflation down are likely  to prove transitory.  That said, we all agree that our inf lation objective is extremely important.  We recognize that there\u2019s been a prolonged shortfall.  This is a s ymmetric 2 percent inflation o bjective, and we continue to indicate that we\u2019ll be monitori ng inflation developments closel y.  And so this is on the horizon and recognized to be one of  the risks facing policy\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Yellen, I wanted to follow up on the questi on about tax changes.  When yo u addressed it earlier today, and when you spoke to Congress last  month, you often describe that you would welcome higher growth in the context of the emp loyment and inflation mandate.  And I guess I wonder how you judge the major provisions of t he House and Senate tax plans:  the corporate rate cut, immediate expensing of big-ticket purchases , new rates for pass-throughs,  temporary rate cuts for individuals.  Do you see thos e, on balance, boosting the produc tive capacity of the U.S. economy as opposed to simply increasing aggregate demand?  And, related  to that, how would you view   the benefit of such tax changes  now, when the economy is nearin g full employment, versus at earlier periods when there was greater resource slack\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I think my colleagues and I mainly see the li kely tax package as boosting aggregate demand, but als o having some potential to bo ost aggregate supply.  So changes on the corporate tax sid e\u2014the reduction in the corporat e tax rate, expensing\u2014will lower the cost of capital.  And while there are a range of estimates and uncertainty about how much stimulus that will provide to investment, in general I would se e some stimulus to investment. In terms of aggregate supply effects, a stronger pace of invest ment could boost capital formation and thereby raise produ ctivity growth and potential G DP or output to some extent.  Exactly how large those effects might be remain uncertain, but that is a channel.  And I suppose it\u2019s also possible\u2014I\u2019m uncertain ho w significant this would be\u2014 that lower marginal effective tax rates for those groups that will see them could boost labor  supply.  And, again, there are a range of estimates in the literatures. I indicated I think participants  have reviewed a number of piec es of analysis, including the Joint Committee on Taxati on estimates, and the many outside  analysts who have weighed in on this and been influenced by tha t kind of analysis\u2014but there is a good deal of uncertainty about what the impacts would be.  And, to the extent that there  are larger impacts than those analyses assume on aggregate s upply or potential GDP, in the co ntext of an economy that has had disturbingly low productivit y growth, that would be welcome  and could support faster GDP growth, at least for some  period, without\u2014you know, without cre ating a need to tighten monetary policy to offset that. So there are potentially bot h demand and supply effects here.  So, importantly, you really don\u2019t, at the end of the day, see  very much change in the feder al funds rate path.  Participants do   recognize that the unemployment ra te is lower than their estima tes of its long-run sustainable rate, so I think we ar e in the vicinity of full employment\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Heather Long from the Washington Post.   You have mentioned that the Committee thinks there will be wage increases next year.  I \u2019m wondering if you could clarify if that is coming in part or mostl y from the changes to the tax  plan.  Is that what the expectation is, would drive the wage increas es?  And I was also wondering, I\u2019ve heard from so many female economists in academia and at the Fed about what an inspiration  you\u2019ve been to them and how melancholy they will be to s ee you go.  I was wondering if you just had any final words to young females and minorities who may be looking to enter economics or  a banking profession and rise to your level\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: I\u2019m sorry, remind me of the first part of your q uestion.  [Laughter\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Wages\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Wages, yes\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Is the tax policy dr iving wage increase expectat ions\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I think, gene rally, in a strong labor mark et where many firms are having difficulty finding quali fied workers, we would expec t, just through normal demand and supply channels, to see some  upward pressure on wage growth  over time.  And as the labor market is tightened, we\u2019ve seen s ome very gradual drift upward in wage gains.  They remain\u2014it remains at a low level, but I w ould expect, in the context of a n ongoing strong labor market, to see some upward pressure.  And I be lieve that\u2019s the main thing that my colleagues are factoring in. On your question on advice to women and minorities, in the Fede ral Reserve, my colleagues and I are very fo cused on wanting to see and do what  we can to foster greater   participation of women and minor ities in economics.  We would l ove to, if we could, increase our hiring ourselves of women and minorities, and we see that b oth women and minorities are studying economics in disproportiona tely and disturbingly low n umbers.  Although the women in STEM fields generally are abou t even with men\u2014represent abou t 50 percent\u2014in economics, women majors constitute somet hing like 30 percent of undergradu ate majors, and there is disproportionate low enrollment of minorities. I will just say, from my own experience, I think economics is a  terrific field.  I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed my career in economics and think there are m any different paths that people can follow that lead to satisfyi ng careers, and that there are very interesting and important questions that economics addresse s.  And it is a great field, a nd I would like to encourage greater involvement and think that peopl e will find that satisfying.  A nd, just in terms of the kinds of research that\u2019s done in the fi eld, I think also a greater diver sity, more women and minorities, may change the focus to some ext ent of the questions that peopl e choose to look at and the analysis that they bring and a r ange of thinking that bears on research.  And all of that would be a healthy development\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Liesman, C NBC.  Every day, it seems, we l ook at the stock market, it goes up triple digits  in the Dow Jones.  To what ext ent are there concerns at the Federal Reserve about current  market valuations, and do they no w or should they, do you think, if we keep going on this trajectory\u2014 should that animate monetar y policy?  Finally, maybe as a sign of what\u2019s been going on with va luations, this cryptocurren cy called bitcoin keeps going up every day.  What is the policy of t he central bank of the Unite d States of the introduction, use, and incredible rise i n popularity of bitcoin? \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Okay.  So let me star t, Steve, with the stock ma rket generally.  I mean, of course the stock mar ket has gone up a great deal this year, and we have in recent months characterized the general level of asset valuations as \u201c elevated.\u201d  What that reflects is simply the assessment that, looki ng at price/earnings ratios an d comparable metrics for other assets other than equities, we s ee ratios that are at the high end of historical ranges\u2014and so that\u2019s worth pointing out.  But economists  are not great at knowing wh at appropriate valuations are.  We don\u2019t have a terrific record, and the fact that those valuat ions are high doesn\u2019t mean that they are necessarily overvalued. We are in a\u2014I\u2019ve mentioned this in my opening statement, and we \u2019ve talked about this repeatedly\u2014likely a low interes t rate environment, lower than w e\u2019ve had in past decades.  And if that turns out to be the case, t hat\u2019s a factor that supports hi gher valuations.  We\u2019re enjoying solid economic growth with low inflati on, and the risks in the global  economy look more balanced than they have in many years .  So I think what we need to and a re trying to think through is, if there were an adjustment in ass et valuations or the stock marke t, what impact would that have on the economy, and would it provoke fi nancial stability concerns?   And I think when we look at other indicators of financial s tability risks, there\u2019s nothing flashing red there or possibly even orange.  We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system , and we\u2019re not seeing some worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive le vels.1  So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays  attention to, but if you ask me, i s this a significant factor shaping monetary policy now, we ll, it\u2019s on the list of risks, it\u2019s not a major\u2014it\u2019s not a major factor. And then you asked about bitcoin, a nd there I would simply say that bitcoin at this time plays a very small role in the payment system.  It is not a sta ble source of\u2014store of value, and it                                                  1 Chair Yellen intended to say that credit growth is not at excessive  levels.   doesn\u2019t constitute legal tender.  It is a highly speculative as set, and the Fed doesn\u2019t really play any role\u2014any regulatory role wi th respect to bitcoin other than  assuring that banking organizations that we do supervis e are attentive, that they\u2019re appropriately  managing any interactions they have with partic ipants in that market and app ropriately monitoring anti-money-laundering Bank Secrecy Act, you know, r esponsibilities that th ey have\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Has there been a  directive, or, more importantl y, has there been a directive about bitcoin to the ba nks and their dealings with bi tcoin from the Federal Reserve\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: I don\u2019t believe the re\u2019s been anything specific a bout that, just, generally, banks have Bank Secrecy  Act anti-money-laundering re sponsibilities, and this applies to bitcoin as it does i n every other realm\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Yelle n, Donna Borak with CNN.  To retur n back to the prospective tax bill questions, in y our view at all, is the Rep ublican tax bill an ill-timed fiscal stimulus, and are you concerned at all it will wind up squander ing the tools both the Congress and the Fed have when it comes time to dealing with a recession \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, look, I will just  say that it is up to the A dministration and Congress to decide on appropr iate fiscal policy, and our job is  to maintain our focus on employment and inflation.  We c ontinue to think, as you can see  from the projections, that a gradual path of rate increases remains appropriate even with al most all participants now factoring in their assessment of  the impact of the tax\u2014the tax policy. You know, it is projected that the tax cut package will lead to  additions to the national debt and boost, by the end of the hor izon, the debt-to-GDP rati o.  And I will say\u2014and this is nothing new, this is something I\u2019v e been saying for a long time \u2014I am personally concerned about the U.S. debt situation.  It\u2019 s not that the debt-to-GDP r atio at the moment is extraordinarily   or worrisomely high, but it\u2019s als o not very low.  And it\u2019s proj ected, as the population continues to age and the baby boomers retire, that that ratio will contin ue to rise in an unsustainable fashion.  So the addition to the  debt, taking what is already a  significant problem and making it worse, is\u2014it is of concern to me , and I think it does suggest t hat in some future downturn, which, well, could occur just for  whatever reason, the amount o f fiscal space that would exist for fiscal policy to play an active role, it will be limited\u2014may we ll be limited\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  A couple of longer-term questions.  First of all, midwa y through the year you talked ab out the issue of whether inflation targets might need to be raise d.  There\u2019s obviously been a lot more debate in the Fed\u2019s system since then about this.  It ma y not be an imminent issue, but do  you expect it to be something the Fed should be discussing over the coming years as some sort of change to the inflation target?  Second of all, the amount of stimul us tools that the Fed may ha ve at its disposal when the next downturn strikes are fairly limited.  One of the incoming gover nors, Marvin Goodfriend, has talked about the merits of negativ e interest rates.  I just won dered whether you see that as a potential\u2014or at least in theory, f or the Fed to consider should  it run out of other options.  Thanks\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So right now the F OMC is not discussing or consi dering its inflation target.  We do see inflation as likely moving up to target over  the next couple of years, and I would say\u2014you said our stimulus too ls are limited.  I would wan t to emphasize that if there were a negative shock to the econom y, we do have some scope to cut t he fed funds rate, and there are other tools available, ones that  we have used previously:  forw ard guidance and asset purchases.  So I think we\u2019re not\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re out of ammunitio n, but certainly it\u2019s been recognized\u2014and I\u2019ve emphasized mys elf that, in the longer run, we may be\u2014and we\u2019ll have to   see how this works out, but we ma y be in low interest rate envi ronments where it could prove useful to have additional scope  to conduct monetary policy.

Coul d you describe what has changed ab out your economic assessment so that everything has cha nged except inflation\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, you know, the proj ections that we\u2019re showi ng you today, many factors went into that, fis cal policy being one of a number of different factors.  And, you know,   you\u2019re looking at 16 participants w ho have made adjustments to their economic outlook for a whole variety of reasons, includ ing, in some cases, rethinking some of the fundamentals that went into their original forecast.  So there have been modifica tions in different directions by different participants.   So I  would caution you about the dang ers of looking at the median and acting like that is on e individual who has made a change to the ir forecast.  That\u2019s a leap that isn\u2019t quite justified. But, look, generally, you see modes tly faster growth over the n ext couple of years, which is consistent and, I said, I thi nk for most participants, refle cts partly an impact from taxes stimulating consumer and investment spending.  But it\u2019s not a g igantic increase in growth that since\u2014relative to September. You do see a lower path for unemployment, but remember that inf lation has also been running low on a persistent basis,  and the Committee does have a concern about inflation and wants to see it moving up.  And, on balance, you see only modes t changes, slight revisions to the path for the fed funds rate .  You might think, well, shouldn\u2019t I see more?  Well, okay, growth is a little stronger, the unemployment rate runs a little bit lower\u2014 that would perhaps push in the direction of slightly tighter  monetary policy.  But, again, cou nterbalancing that is that inflation has run lower than we expect , and, you know, it could take a lo nger period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve  the inflation objective\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Justine Un derhill, Yahoo Finance.

But I really want to caution that this is not s omething the Federal Reserve is seriously considering at this stage while we\u2019re looking at re search on this to pic.  There are , I think, to my mind, limited benefits from introducing it, a  limited need for it, and some s ubstantial concerns.

So you m entioned in response to Steve\u2019s question t hat asset valuations, you didn\u2019t think, were on the sort of high-priority risk list right no w.  So I\u2019m wondering, what do you th ink is on that risk list?  And, more broadly, what have you left undone ?  You\u2019ve gotten high marks f or bringing the economy back towards its goals, but are the re things that are going to nag y ou when you walk out of here in February and say, \u201cReally, I wis h I\u2019d seen this to completion\u201d?   I mean, we\u2019re not doing negative interest rates.  We\u2019re not doing i nflation framework.  What\u2019s a t your top of\u2014what\u2019s at the top of the to-do list that you are not  getting to see to bring to grou nd here\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So you asked about t he risk list.  There are alw ays risks that affect the outlook.  We tend to focus in our ow n evaluation on economic ri sks, and we\u2019ve characterized them as \u201cbalanced.\u201d  And I t hink they are balanced.  You know, I can always give you a list of, you know, potential troubles, interna tional developments that c ould result in downside economic risk.  But, look, at the moment t he U.S. economy is performing well.  The growth that we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s not based on, for ex ample, an unsustainable buildu p of debt as we had in the run-up   to the financial crisis.  The  global economy is doing well.  We \u2019re in a synchronized expansion.  This is the first time in many y ears that we\u2019ve  seen this.  Inf lation around the world is generally low.  So I think the risks are ba lanced, and there\u2019s less to lo se sleep about now t han has been true for quite some time, so I feel  good about the economic out\u2014the economic outlook. I feel, you know, good that th e labor market is in a very much stronger place than it was eight years ago.  We have created 17 million jobs.  We\u2019ve got a  good, strong labor market and a very low unemployment rate, and I  think that\u2019s been tremendousl y important to the well-being of American households and workers .  And I feel very pleased when I hear anecdotes from firms that tell me they\u2019re having a  hard time finding workers, and th ey talk about, given that they\u2019re taking on people with skills that don\u2019t quite match what they w ant, but they\u2019re training them, and, you know, giving them the traini ng that they need in order  to be able to fill jobs.  I think that\u2019s a development that is a  natural one that occurs in a str ong labor market that tends to build human capital and worker skills , and that that\u2019s a strong posit ive. As I mentioned, I think the finan cial system is on much sounder  footing, and that we have done a great deal to put in place gr eater capital, liquidity, a nd so forth that ma ke it less crisis prone, and that has been a n important objective. What\u2019s on my \u201cundone\u201d list, you ask?  We have a 2 percent symme tric inflation objective, and, for a number of  years now, inflation has been r unning under 2 percent.  And I consider it an important prior ity to make sure that inflation d oesn\u2019t chronically undershoot our 2 percent objective, and I wa nt to see it move up to 2 percent.   So most of my colleagues and I do believe that it\u2019s being held dow n by transitory factors, but th ere\u2019s work undone there, in the sense\u2014we need to see it move  up in line with ou r objective. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Chair Y ellen, what do you think will be  the drivers of inflation over the next couple of years, and how long will the Committee go with low unemployment, low inflation befo re you rethink monetary policy\u2014 this gradual rate hikes?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, you know, I think f or a number of years\u2014so w e\u2019ve had an undershoot of inflation for a numbe r of years.  We absolutely r ecognize that.  I think until this year, undershoot was understandab le.  First we had a good deal of slack in the labor market.  Then we had plummeting oil pr ices.  And, beginning in mid-2014,  there was a marked depreciation in the dollar.2  And those three factors hel d down inflation for a number of y ears.   Now, in 2016, core inflation came  very close to 2 percent.  We seemed to be on a path of inflation moving up, and this ye ar, beginning in March, there s eemed to be a sequence of negative surprises.  Some reflec t one-time factors that were ea sily identifiable, like a marked decline in quality-adjusted cel l phone plans.  There may be oth er factors that are not so easy to name, but we would judge\u2014you know, inf lation doesn\u2019t always fol low exactly.  There are errors and many factors that affect i t beyond the key influences of la bor market slack:  exchange rates and import prices and oil prices .  Those are three big ones.  B ut there are other factors that affect inflation too, and our judgment at  this point is that transitor y factors that are unrelated to the broader macroeconomic outl ook are holding inflation down. But I have tried to be straightfo rward in saying that this coul d end up being something that is more ingrained and tur ns out to be permanent.  It\u2019s ver y important to watch it and, if necessary, rethink what\u2019s determ ining inflation.

Glad to hear yo u\u2019re staying on the East Coast.  I\u2019m just curi ous, I wanted to follow up to the  bitcoin questions, but\u2014because you\u2019ve lived through what we a ll experienced in 2007, 2008, and \u2014should the Fed take a more active role in trying to iden tify who some of the counterparty and what the exposure is with bitcoin as a potential threat to f inancial stability?  Just\u2014the  best minds at the Fed can sometimes miss these kinds of threats.  Your predecessor, Mr. Bernanke, a ctually said in \u201907 that the contagion from subprime would not  affect the housing market or the economy.  So are we underestimating the potential threat from bitcoin as it runs up  in value\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I certainly a gree that it\u2019s important for the Fed to attempt to understand emerging risks to finan cial stability and to be look ing not just in the banking system but outside it for developments t hat could pose financial risks , and we are doing that.  And, I would say, one of the changes durin g my tenure is, we devoted\u2014d ecided in the aftermath of the crisis that we needed to devote considerable resources to finan cial stability to monitor for emerging threats, and now we have a t the Board a full-blown div ision of financial  stability that\u2019s involved in doing that. Now, when you ask about bitcoin, I  still see the financial stab ility risks from it as limited.  Often, risks threatening financial  stability arise when there\u2019s  exposure of the banking system to fluctuating asset valuations, a nd I really don\u2019t see any signif icant exposure of our core financial institutions to threats from b itcoin if its value were to fluct uate.  I don\u2019t see a threat to our core financial institutions.

President Trump, while you were speaking, jus t said that he thinks his ta x plan will produce 4 percent growth.  Do you think that is pos sible?  Second, do you think t hat there is any Fed blame or complicity in the flattening of  the yield curve, and are you wo rried that there might be some sort of policy mistake built into that that could slow the economy?  And the last question, which is a bit of a valedictory, is one that everybody on Wall Street has wanted to ask you for four years.  Since this is your last press conference, can you tell us which  dot is yours?  [Laughter\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I can answer the last question first.  The  answer is \u201cno.\u201d  I\u2019ve never been willing to reveal which dot is mine, and I\u2019m not goi ng to change that now. So, you know, my assessment, and I think most participants\u2019 ass essments, as I said, of the impact of the tax policy on grow th has been informed by work by  the Joint Committee on Taxation and other analysts.  A nd everyone recognizes that ther e\u2019s uncertainty about what the economic effects would be, and I w ouldn\u2019t want to rule anything  out.  It is challenging, however, to achieve growth of the level s that you mentioned.  Look, if t he package were to stimulate growth of that magnitude, let me just say again, the Federal Re serve would welcome that.  If it\u2019s a supply-side\u2014favorable supply-si de developments that would be compatible with the attainment of our employment a nd inflation objectives, that\u2019s s omething that would be very, very welcome.  But it would be challe nging to achieve numbers like t hat.   Let\u2019s see, I think you also then ask ed me about the yield curve , and\u2014I mean, there is much discussion about yield curve  inversions and whether or not  a flattening yield curve could signal a recession.  Is that t he brunt of your question\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And whether the F ed has made\u2014if there\u2019s a polic y mistake embedded in that\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: .  So this is somethi ng that we discussed and have looked at.  The yield curve has flattened some as we  have raised short rates.  It mai nly\u2014the flattening yield curve mainly reflects higher short-t erm rates.  The yield curve is no t currently inverted, and I would say that the current slope is we ll within its historical range.  Now, there is a strong correla tion historically between yield c urve inversions and recessions, but let me emphasize that correlation is not causat ion, and I think that there are good reasons to think that the relati onship between the slope of the  yield curve and the business cycle may have changed.  And one reason for that is that long-term in terest rates generally embody two factors.  One is the expected average value of short rates over, say, 10 years, and the second piece of it is a so-ca lled term premium that often reflects thi ngs like inflation\u2014inflation risk. Typically, the term premium historically has been positive.  So  when the yield curve has inverted historically, it meant that short-term rates were well  above average expected short rates over the longer run.  So with the positive term premium, that\u2019s  what it means.  And typically that means that monetary policy is restrictive, sometimes quite rest rictive, and some of those recessions were situations in which the Fed was consciously tig htening monetary policy because inflation was high and trying to slow the economy. Well, right now the term premiu m is estimated to be quite low, close to zero, and that means that, structurally\u2014and thi s can be true going forward\u2014tha t the yield curve is likely to be   flatter than it\u2019s been in the pa st.  And so it could more easil y invert.  If the Fed were to even move to a slightly restrictiv e policy stance, you could see an inversion with a zero term premium. So I think the fact the term pr emium is so low and the yield cu rve is generally flatter is an important factor to consider.  Now , I think it\u2019s also important  to realize that mar ket participants are not expressing heightened conc ern about the decline of the term premium, and, when asked directly about the odds of recession, they see it as low, and I  would concur with that judgment.

Economic growth has been solid, with household spending expanding and business investment picking up.The labor market has continued to improve, with a relatively steady participation rate and ample opportunities for workers, leading to a strong job market outlook. However, the pace of job gains is expected to moderate over time as monetary policy accommodation is gradually reduced to avoid the risk of an abrupt tightening and jeopardizing the economic expansion. Additionally, despite economic growth and a stronger labor market, inflation remains below the FOMC's target.The 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures increased slightly to 1.6 percent in October, but remains below earlier rates. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, followed a similar pattern and was 1.4 percent in October. The Federal Reserve expects inflation to rise and stabilize around 2 percent over the next few years, although their understanding of the factors driving inflation is imperfect. They will closely monitor inflation developments and adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve their goals. The median projection for real GDP growth is 2.5 percent this year and next, moderating to 2 percent by 2020.The FOMC projects that the unemployment rate will remain around 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and close to 4 percent over the next three years, slightly below its long-run normal rate. Inflation is expected to be 1.7 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020.The FOMC anticipates that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate will remain below previous levels, which aligns with participants' projections of appropriate monetary policy. The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of next year, 2.7 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.1 percent in 2020, with the median path unchanged through 2019 and slightly higher in 2020 compared to previous projections.The speaker announces that this will be their last scheduled news conference, but they will work to ensure a smooth transition to their successor, Jay Powell, who they believe is equally committed to the Federal Reserve's mission. They express gratitude to the attentive audience and remain open to taking questions.", "question_answer_summary": ["QUESTION: Could you give us any insight into the discussion on major tax changes and its impact on rate hikes?\nANSWER: Most participants factored in the prospect of fiscal stimulus into their projections, but changes in projections since September should not be seen as an estimate of the tax package's impact. The general expectation is that the tax changes would provide a modest lift to GDP growth and decrease unemployment. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the impacts, and the effects will be monitored over time. Participants continue to see gradual rate increases as appropriate.", "'QUESTION': Are you confident that soft inflation will still be the case, particularly regarding wage gains?\n'ANSWER': Incoming wage data suggests only modest upward pressure on wages, indicating that the labor market is not overheated. The modest pace of wage gains may also reflect slow productivity growth. While there is uncertainty about what's holding inflation down, we believe the factors responsible for holding inflation down are likely to be transitory. However, we recognize the importance of our inflation objective and will closely monitor inflation developments.", "QUESTION: How does the Federal Reserve view the major provisions of the House and Senate tax plans and their impact on the U.S. economy's productive capacity?\n\nANSWER: The likely tax package is seen as boosting aggregate demand and potentially boosting aggregate supply. Changes in the corporate tax rate and expensing could stimulate investment and raise productivity growth. Lower marginal effective tax rates could also potentially boost labor supply. However, there is uncertainty about the exact impacts and the Federal Reserve does not anticipate significant changes in the federal funds rate path.", "'QUESTION': Is the expectation of wage increases next year driven by changes to the tax plan?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen asks for a reminder of the first part of the question, indicating that she did not fully understand it.", "'QUESTION': Wages?\n'ANSWER': Yes, wages.", "'QUESTION': Is the tax policy driving wage increase expectations?\n'ANSWER': In a strong labor market, we would expect to see some upward pressure on wage growth over time. As the labor market tightens, we have seen gradual drift upward in wage gains. However, wage growth remains at a low level. The main factor my colleagues consider is the ongoing strong labor market. Additionally, the Federal Reserve is focused on fostering greater participation of women and minorities in economics, as their enrollment numbers are disproportionately low. Encouraging greater involvement in economics can lead to satisfying careers and bring diverse perspectives to research.", "'QUESTION': To what extent are there concerns at the Federal Reserve about current market valuations, and do they now or should they, if we keep going on this trajectory\u00e2\u0080\u0094should that animate monetary policy? What is the policy of the central bank of the United States of the introduction, use, and incredible rise in popularity of bitcoin? \n'ANSWER': The stock market has seen significant growth this year, and asset valuations are considered elevated. However, economists are not great at determining appropriate valuations. The current low interest rate environment and solid economic growth support higher valuations. The Fed is monitoring the impact of any adjustment in asset valuations on the economy and financial stability. Bitcoin plays a small role in the payment system and is a highly speculative asset. The Fed does not regulate bitcoin but ensures supervised banks manage their interactions with the market appropriately.", "'QUESTION': Has there been a directive about bitcoin to the banks and their dealings with bitcoin from the Federal Reserve?\n'ANSWER': I don't believe there's been anything specific about that. Generally, banks have anti-money-laundering responsibilities under the Bank Secrecy Act, and this applies to bitcoin as it does in every other realm.", "'QUESTION': Is the Republican tax bill an ill-timed fiscal stimulus and are you concerned it will squander the tools of Congress and the Fed in dealing with a recession?\n'ANSWER': It is up to the Administration and Congress to decide on fiscal policy. Our focus is on employment and inflation. The tax cut package will increase the national debt and debt-to-GDP ratio, which is already a concern. This limits the fiscal space for future downturns.", "'QUESTION': Do you expect the Fed to discuss raising inflation targets in the coming years? And would negative interest rates be a potential option if other tools are exhausted?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC is not currently discussing changing the inflation target. We believe inflation will reach target levels in the next few years. While our stimulus tools are limited, we still have the ability to cut interest rates and use forward guidance and asset purchases. However, in the long run, it may be useful to have additional options for conducting monetary policy, and further research is being done on this.", "'QUESTION': Do you believe that negative interest rates are possible in the U.S. at some point?\n'ANSWER': We have not studied negative interest rates extensively and have not seriously considered using them during the recent downturn. We have observed their implementation in other countries and believe it is an area that academics may explore in the future, but it has not been a priority for the Fed.", "'QUESTION': Are there any tweaks to Dodd-Frank that you think might still be beneficial, beyond the Senate bank regulatory reform bill?\n'ANSWER': I think the bill does address a wide range of issues that we've highlighted in the past, where additional flexibility to tailor our supervisory requirements would be worthwhile. I don't have additional things on the congressional list.", "'QUESTION': T oo big to fail.\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen acknowledges the concern about institutions being too big to fail.", "'QUESTION': Are there any banks that are too big to fail right now?\n'ANSWER': We continue to work on resolution plans and the structure of systemic firms to ensure they can be resolved under the bankruptcy code or the Orderly Liquidation Authority. We have learned more and detailed our expectations for firms with living wills, and they have made progress in adopting measures to enable successful resolution.", "QUESTION: Can you explain why the economic assessment has changed in various aspects except for inflation?\n\nANSWER: The economic assessment has changed due to factors such as fiscal policy, but it is important to note that the projections are based on the adjustments made by 16 participants with different reasons for their modifications. While there is expected to be modestly faster growth and lower unemployment, inflation has been persistently low, which is a concern for the Committee. Achieving the inflation objective may require a longer period of a strong labor market.", "'QUESTION': What use do you see a cryptocurrency could have for the Fed, and do you see the potential of a cryptocurrency that might be considered legal tender?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is not seriously considering adopting a digital currency at this stage. While there is a discussion among central bankers about the potential merits, there are limited benefits, limited need, and substantial concerns. However, central banks are exploring the topic to see if there could be benefits in the future.", "QUESTION: Chair Yellen, can you comment on the recent economic growth and its impact on families?\n\nANSWER: Chair Yellen, before I ask this question, thanks for your stewardship of the economy, the benefits of which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in some of the harder-hit parts of my own family, so\nCHAIR YELLEN: Thank you.", "'QUESTION': How does the appointment process for Federal Reserve Bank presidents align with the commitment to gender diversity, and should it be more transparent and accountable?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve Act gives nonbanking directors responsibility for conducting a search, with the Board of Governors approving the candidates. Efforts are made to create a diverse pool, but there is no guarantee of increased diversity. The appointed individuals are deemed qualified, but greater diversity is hoped for.", "'QUESTION': Should the process be more open somehow?\n'ANSWER': The process has become more open with public outreach, information on websites, acceptance of potential names and nominees, and meetings with community groups to enlarge the pool and get suggestions. It has moved in the direction of being more open.", "'QUESTION': Do you have any advice for incoming Chair Powell?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen expresses confidence in Chair Powell, stating that he understands the Federal Reserve well, shares its values, and is committed to its mission, independence, and nonpartisan approach. She highlights his long-standing participation in the FOMC and his alignment with the consensus, indicating that he is well-positioned and knowledgeable to lead the Federal Reserve in the future.", "'QUESTION': Do you have any reservations about the new leadership's ability to deregulate in a way that maintains financial system stability and the advances made from post-crisis regulation?\n'ANSWER': All of my colleagues on the Board are committed to keeping in place the core reforms that have strengthened the financial system. We are considering stronger capital requirements, stronger liquidity requirements, stress-testing, and resolution planning. We agree on tailoring regulatory requirements based on the systemic footprint of firms and relieving burdens on community banks.", "'QUESTION': Are there any important differences between your colleagues and your vision on regulatory reform?\n'ANSWER': So I have not seen anything emerge at this point that I would describe as a significant difference.", "'QUESTION': What is on the risk list and what is left undone?\n'ANSWER': The risk list includes potential troubles from international developments, but the US economy is currently performing well with balanced risks. The undone task is achieving the 2 percent inflation objective, as inflation has been running under 2 percent for years and needs to move up in line with the objective.", "QUESTION: What are the drivers of inflation and how long will the Committee wait before rethinking monetary policy?\nANSWER: Factors such as labor market slack, exchange rates, import prices, and oil prices affect inflation. Transitory factors unrelated to the macroeconomic outlook are currently holding inflation down, but it is important to monitor and potentially rethink inflation if necessary. The Committee believes they are on track to achieve their 2 percent objective.", "'QUESTION': What are Chair Yellen's plans when she steps down from the Fed and is she disappointed that she won't be continuing in this job?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen doesn't have any definite plans yet, but she expects to maintain her home in Berkeley and keep Washington as her base. She feels positive about her time at the Fed and believes it's the right time for her to leave, but she considers it an honor and privilege to have served in senior positions at the institution.", "'QUESTION': Should the Fed take a more active role in identifying the counterparty and exposure to bitcoin as a potential threat to financial stability?\n'ANSWER': The Fed recognizes the importance of understanding emerging risks to financial stability and has dedicated resources to monitor for such threats. However, the financial stability risks from bitcoin are seen as limited, as there is no significant exposure of core financial institutions to bitcoin's fluctuating value. While individuals may lose money, it does not pose a full-blown financial stability risk.", "'QUESTION': Do you think it is possible for President Trump's tax plan to produce 4 percent growth? Do you think the Fed is to blame for the flattening of the yield curve and is there a policy mistake that could slow the economy?\n'ANSWER': The impact of the tax policy on growth is uncertain, but achieving growth of that magnitude would be challenging. The Fed would welcome supply-side developments that are compatible with employment and inflation objectives. There is discussion about whether a flattening yield curve could signal a recession, but it is not clear if that is the main concern.", "'QUESTION': Is there a policy mistake embedded in the flattening yield curve?\n'ANSWER': The flattening yield curve mainly reflects higher short-term rates and is not currently inverted. The relationship between the slope of the yield curve and the business cycle may have changed due to the low term premium. Market participants do not express heightened concern about the decline of the term premium and see the odds of recession as low."]}
