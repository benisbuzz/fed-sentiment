Harriet Torry with the Wall Street Journal.  Why does the Fed now see three rate increases next year instead of two?  Is it because the economy is at risk of overheating , or is the Fed behind the curve , or is this a reaction to Donald Trump\u2019 s election?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I would like to emphasize that this is a very modest adjustment in the path of the federal funds rate and involves changes by only, you know, some of, you know, some of the participants.  So in thinking about the paths and the revisions, there are a number of factors that were taken into account by participants.  The unemployment rate is perhaps a touch, as I said, a touch lower than previously ; you\u2019ve seen some modest downward revisions in that \u2014in that  projection.  For this year, there was a slight u pward revision to inflation, and some of the participants , but not all of the participants , did incorporate some assumption of a change in fiscal policy into their projections.

It\u2019s the ultimate determination of the evolution of living standards.  Policies that would improve productivity growth would include policy changes that enhance education, training, workforce development ; policies that spur either private or public investment to enhance the quality of capital in the United States that workers have to work with;  and policie s that spur innovation or competition or the formation of new firms.  So tax policies can have that e ffect.  It really depends on the specifics.  I don\u2019 t think there \u2019s anything that I could say in general about what tax policy would do , but that \u2014and I really can \u2019t tell you what the F ed\u2019s response would be to any policy changes that are put into effect.

A quick follow -up\u2014 I\u2019m sorry , but if there was a rush of fiscal policy that did not increase the productive capacity of the economy, would that mean the Federal Reserve would have to move more quickly with raising rates?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: \u2014you know, it \u2019s some thing I really just can \u2019t generalize about because, w hile it would be desirable to have tax policies that do increase the productive capacity    of the economy , an increase in the pace of productivity change is one of the factors  that does affect the economy \u2019s neutral rate.  A  boost to prod uctivity could spur investment .  As we have been saying , we estimate that the value of the neu tral federal funds rate is quite  low\u2014has \u2014and one of the reasons for that is s low productivity growth.

For the average American, can you explain what the impact of this hike and three additional hikes will be next year?  And should they feel more confident in the economy now that you are raising rates at  a slightly faster pace?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So let me say that our decision to raise rates is \u2014should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confi dence we have in the pr ogress  the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue .  And the economy ha s proven to be remarka bly resilient.  So it is a vote of  confidence in the economy.  As you know, this was a decision that was well anticipated in markets , and I think it will have relatively small effect on market rates.  It could boost very slightly some short -term interest rates that could have an effect on borrowing costs that are linked to them, but , overall, I think that households and firms will see very  modest changes from this decision.  But , certainly, it\u2019 s important for households and businesses to understand that my colleagues and I have judged the course of the U .S. economy to be strong , that we \u2019re making progress toward our inflation and unemployme nt goals.  We have a  strong labor market , and we have a resilient economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.   Clearly, there\u2019 s been a lot of discussion already about fiscal \u2014fiscal policy.  But even if you discount or don\u2019 t know what the fiscal outlook is going to be next year, unemployment is already below the longer -run projection    under the policy rule you cited in your August speech.  That would suggest that policy ought to be tighter.   Is there a risk that the Federal Reserve is alread y behind the curve , even before any fiscal impact steps in next year?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I would agree that \u2014and as  we said in our statement \u2014policy remains accommodative.  The degree of accommodation I would characterize as moderate.  As I\u2019ve emphas ized and said in the statement, we currently judge the neutral level of the federal funds rate to be pretty low.  So there is some accommodation.  Remember that inflation is still below our objective.  The C ommittee projects \u2014at least the median projection shows a very modest undershoot of estimates  of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment.  The median unemployment rate here gets down to 4\u00bd percent, which is just a few tenths below the estimated longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate.  And we think that that \u2019s appropriate because we want inflation to rise to our 2 percent  objective in a timely fashion.  So there is not a substantial undershoot of the natural rate of unemployment.  We \u2019re not seeing evidence in labor markets of very substantial upward pressures on labor that could signify extreme shortages of labor that could propel inflation higher in a very rapid way, and inflation is still operating below our objective.  So I do not j udge  that we are behind the curve.  I\u2019ve\u2014my judgment is that we \u2019re on a good path  to reaching our objectives.  But , of course , the outlook is uncertain.  We recognize that there are many sources of uncertainty affecting the outlook.  And we will have to ad just our thinking as things evolve, as conditions \u2014conditions evolve, and we learn more about economic policy changes that could affect the outlook\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jim Tankersley , Washington Post.  I\u2019m curious, you and your predecessor had both at times c alled for more fiscal stimulus to help with the outlook, the growth outlook.  And I \u2019m wondering , how much do you judge the economy has capacity for fiscal    stimulus right now?  It\u2019s a version of Steve \u2019s question, but I think we \u2019re trying to get at, how much  can happen before we run that risk of overheating?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I believe my predecessor and I called for fiscal stimulus when the unemployment rate was substantially higher  than it is now.  So, with a 4.6 percent  unemployment and a solid labor ma rket, there may be some additional slack in labor markets , but I would judge that the degree of slack has diminished.  So I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment.  But , nevertheless, let me be careful that I  am not trying to provide advice t o the new A dministration or to Congress as to what is the appropriate stance of policy.  There are many considerations th at Congress needs to take account of and many bases for justif ying changing fiscal policy.  I\u2019ve continued to highlight the importance of spurring productivity growth, that I think that would be something that \u2019s beneficial for the economy.  Of course , it\u2019s also important for Congress to take account of the fact that , as our population ages , that the debt -to-GDP ratio is projected to rise , and that needs to continue to be taken into account.  And so there are many factors that I think should enter into such decisions\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Chair Yellen, you\u2019ve just spoken about some of the risks \u2014the inflationary risks of running in this expansionary fiscal policy.  But in October you were wondering whether it might be possible to repair some of the damage done to the labor force during the recession by running what you termed a \u201c high-pressure economy .\u201d  So I \u2019m wondering, why couldn\u2019 t fiscal policy serve the same end in seeking to run a high- pressure economy , hoping to draw more Americans off the sidelines and into the workforce?  Is there something necessarily riskier about approaching it    from the fiscal side , or perhaps have you become less enthusiastic about the idea of running a high-pressure economy?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I want to be clear that what I said in that speech in Boston is that an important research question is whether or not , in an economy with a very strong labor market , there might be changes that took place that permanently raised the labor force participation , training , and other thing s of the labor \u2014of the labor force that would be positives for the productive potential of our economy on a long -lasting basis.  I never said that I favor running a high-pressure economy.  And, you know, as you can see in the SE P projections of the particip ants\u2014and this has long been true not just in this forecast , but in earlier ones as well \u2014you see a modest undershooting.  The under \u2014unemployment rate is projected to modestly undershoot , for several years, levels that are deemed to be normal in the longer r un.  T hat\u2019s an appropriate policy  purely on the grounds that inflation is running below our objective.  And while we do n\u2019t want to overshoot our 2 percent  objective, we also don\u2019 t want a  persistent undershoot of our 2 percent  objective, and that does  invol ve a labor market that may succeed in attracting more people off the sidelines into the labor market.  I t\u2019s something we will see as we examine experience over the next couple of years.  We may adjust our views on this .

I\u2019m a strong believer in the independence of the Fed.

Yes.  So, okay, on financial regulation, I feel that we live d through a  devastating financial crisis that took a huge toll on our economy.  And most members of Congress and the public came away from that exper ience feeling that it was important to take a set of steps that would result in a safer and stronger financial system.  And I    feel that we have done that.  That has been our mission since the financial crisis for the last six or seven years.  That \u2019s what Dodd- Frank was designed to do. I think it \u2019s very important that we have reduced the odds that a systemically important firm could fail by requiring higher capital, higher liquidity , by performing stress tests that provide us another way of e nsuring that th e firms we count on to supply credit to households and businesses would be able to go on doing that even in the face of a severely adverse shock.  The firms \u2014the largest firms have a great deal more capital than they did before the crisis.  Those are import ant changes.  We have placed the toughest regulations on those firms that are systemically important.  I would advise that \u2014and we have been trying to do this \u2014that it\u2019 s important to look for ways to relieve regulatory burden on community banks and smaller i nstitutions , to tailor regulation so that it\u2019 s appropriate for the systemic risk profile of the particular institutions.  I think there was broad  agreement also that we s hould end \u201c too bi g to fail,\u201d  and that means not only reducing the odds of the failure of a systemically important institution , but also making sure that , should such a firm fail , that it could be resolved in an orderly way.  And the living wills process has been about that , and I think we \u2019ve made considerable progress in making sure that the  largest and most systemic firms conduct their businesses in a day -to-day way with some thought about \u2014with important  thinking in place about whether or not the way they are conducting their business would aid resolution in the event that they encountered a  severe negative shock.  So this is progress , I would say , it\u2019s very important not to roll back.  There may be some changes that could be made, and we \u2019ve suggested a few , like eliminating the burden of compliance with the Volcker  rule, or incentive compensation, regulations for smaller banks , or modestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to enhance d prudential supervision.  But I would urge that it \u2019s important to keep this in place.  \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Marty Crutsinger with the Associa ted Press.

And also, did you have any broader discussion about Trump\u2019 s economic plan and what it might do and how the Fed might have to react?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we did discuss the se topics in our meeting today.  I would simply summarize by saying that all the  FOMC participants recognize that  there is considerable uncertainty about how economic policies may change and what effect they will have on the economy.  And in so far as that  will affect monetary policy, of course we will have to factor those policies along with many other things, including the global environment and oil prices and other matters.  We will have to factor that into our outlook and figure out what is an appropria te response.  But we \u2019re operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment , and we have time to wait to see what changes occur and to factor those into our decisionmaking as we gain greater clarity.  You mentioned the market moves.  So I see the market mo ves as implicit forecast s about what impact these policies are likely to have on the economy.  The changes \u2014the financial market changes that you described, particularly the increase in stock prices, the increase in longer -term rates , and the strengthening of the dollar , suggest that many market participants anticipate expansionary fiscal policies that would raise interest rate s somewhat in the United States relative to abroad and would cause a  strengthening in the dollar.

One of the things we \u2019ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history and around the globe is that , very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a recession, that productivity doesn\u2019 t pick up to pre -recession levels and that there looks like there is a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy , which is called \u201c hysteresis. \u201d  And I raise d the question as to whether or not this might operate in the opposite direction as well.  We have seen quite a few people who lost their jobs duri ng the G reat R ecession drop out of the labor force  and, you know, lose their ties and become discouraged and not reenter.

And , as I indicated, I think the path that you see \u2014that the Committee has laid out in a tentative way that involves a modest degree of undershooting of normal longer -run levels of unemployment going down to around 4\u00bd percent would remain for a couple of years \u2014might provide some insight.  So I was not recommending a substantially easier policy in order to test that hypothesis\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Madam Chair.  I guess my question to\u2014that I had before that follow -up was, both times you\u2019 ve raised rates in this cycle, t he market expectations o f a rate hike have been over 50 percent.  The market has, you know, kind of priced it in.  Is that a prerequ isite going forward?  Will that have to happen as you go forward?   \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: It\u2019s not a prerequisite , but we do try to explain our evolving views  as clearly as we can.  It\u2019s important for market participants to have a sense of how we think about the economy and the appropriate path of policy , to look at incoming data , and to form their own judgments as to whether or not changes in policy would be appropriate.  And while  it\u2019s not a prerequisite , if we \u2019re in good sync in terms of explaining what goes into our policy judgments , it\u2019s not surprising that it would often be true that moves are well anticipated by the market.  As I said, in thinking about today \u2019s move, we \u2019ve indicated that we thought we  were making progress on our objectives.  We wanted to see some more.  I think anyone looking at incoming data can clearly see that we have enjoyed further progress both in the labor market and on inflation.  And , therefore, there are good reasons why the market should have antic ipated a moved today.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Yellen, Patrick Gillespie with CNN.  There \u2019s been a lot of discussion about manufacturing jobs and trade.  I\u2019m wondering, what do you think are two or three concrete steps that could be taken to increase manufacturing employment in the United  States?  And , separately, I \u2019ve asked you about the importance of job training program s, something that you\u2019 ve emphasized.  Specifically, what  do you think about the worker  assistance provided to workers who lose their jobs to trade, both the financial ass istance and the worker retraining programs?  Are they sufficient?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So , I don\u2019 t want to weigh in.  I don\u2019 t intend to weigh in.  I haven \u2019t weighed in on either fiscal policy , specifics of evaluating policies.  I\u2019m not going to weigh in either on the details of particular trade policies.  But, more generally, I \u2019d say , you asked me about manufacturing.  There were a lot of manufacturing jobs lost over a long period of time and particularly after \u2014during the G reat R ecession.  We\u2019ve had some recovery in manufacturing employment as the econom y\u2019s recovered.  So, to some extent, manufacturing employment    depends on the progress of the economy, and we have seen some recovery.  Over a long period  of time, technological change  is something that has been important in reducing manufacturing employment absolutely and as  a share of jobs in the economy.  For decades, the pace of technological change in manufacturing has outstripped that in the economy as a whole.  And , so, firms \u2014man ufacturing firms have found it easier to continue producing by \u2014with reducing their workforces.  And that \u2019s a change that I would expect to continue.  You mentioned worker assistance.  So some of the forces that are acting on manufacturing and other sectors , including technological change and globalization\u2014e ven though most economists would judge the overall consequences of these developments for the economy to be positive, certainly there are groups of workers who were harmed by developments pertaining to glo balization and technology.  And I think most economists and policymakers recognize that it \u2019s important to provide ways for workers who were harmed by these kinds of developments to be retrained for jobs so that they can succeed in the economy.  And so, I m ean, I would agree \u2014without getting into any particular program and whether it\u2019 s sufficient , I do think that it\u2019 s important to recognize there are those who were harmed by these developments , and their concerns, I think, need to be addressed by policymaker s, certainly.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Justine Underhill, Yahoo Finance.  So the F ed\u2019s balance sheet has grown to over $4 trillion.  And as the Fed begins removing policy accommodation, under what circumstances would you see the Fed removing or possibly winding down its  balance sheet  in either letting mature \u2014securities mature or possibly outright selling bonds from the  SOMA portfolio?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we \u2019ve indicated in our normalization principles that we expect to diminish the size of our portfolio over time l argely by ceasing reinvestments of principal rather    than by selling securities.  We \u2019ve indicated that once the process of normalization of the federal funds rate is well under way, we would probably begin to allow our portfolio to run off.  We \u2019ve not yet m ade any precise decisions about when that will occur.  We want to feel that if the economy w ere to suffer an adverse shock, that we have some scope through traditional means of interest rate cuts to be able to respond to that.  Now, there\u2019 s no mechanical r ule about what level of the federal funds rate we might deem appropriate to begin that process.  It\u2019s not something that only depends on the le vel of the federal funds rate .  It also depends on our judgment of the amount of momentum in the economy and poss ible concerns about downside risks to  the economy.  So we \u2019ve not yet made this decision, but it is something that we have long planned, to begin to allow our balance sheet to run off.  And then it would take several years.  And we would end up, if all goes well, with a  substantially smalle r balance sheet than we have at  present.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires.  I wonder ed if the unexpected outcome of the election and the sense that a lot of people are really upset with how the economy is performing despite having, you know, aggregate economic statistics that look pretty good\u2014i s that causing you in any way to think differently about how you evaluate the economy, like what sort of things you look for to get a sense of what \u2019s going on in the economy ?  Is\u2014you know, basically, did how things turned  out in  the election \u2014is it making you think differently about how you evaluate the economy \u2019s performance and how it \u2019s doing\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: .  Well, I mean, we \u2019ve long been aware, a nd I\u2019ve spoken about previously disturbing trends in the economy, particularly rising wage inequality, income inequality, and the fact that a significant share of our population hasn\u2019 t been enjoying significant real wage gains , if any.  And so these are long -standi ng concerns.  These are not new phenomenon, but the recession was very severe and probably exacerbated developments that had    long been affecting many American workers and households.  And I think they are quite disturbing. Now, the y\u2019re ones that the Fed is  not well  positioned\u2014 I think our policies can affect the general level of economic activity and slack in the labor market, the level \u2014the rate of inflation , which we focus on.  But I think it \u2019s important for policymakers more broadly to be attentive to these trends and to think about policies that could address them.  We \u2019ve been quite attentive with respect to particular demographic groups in the labor market .  Particularly , minorities tend to be very badly affected by downturns.  We \u2019ve discussed that .  We\u2019ve been focused on it \u2014it\u2019s not just since the election \u2014and are pleased to see that they are enjoying gains.  For example, the African  American unemployment rate at this point is no w rough\u2014 about back to 2007 levels as well.

They anticipate further strengthening of the job market and a rise in inflation to 2 percent over the next few years, while also acknowledging the moderate pace of economic growth and softness in business investment.Job gains have remained strong, averaging nearly 180,000 per month over the past three months, while the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since 2007. As labor market conditions continue to improve, the Federal Reserve expects job conditions to strengthen further and inflation to rise to its 2 percent objective over the next couple of years.The FOMC's inflation outlook is based on the belief that longer-run inflation expectations are stable, while market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased but remain low. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations have seen little change. The committee remains committed to their 2 percent inflation objective and will closely monitor progress towards this goal. The economic projections submitted by committee participants show a projected increase in GDP growth from 1.9 percent this year to 2.1 percent in 2017, with the unemployment rate projected to be 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and 4.5 percent over the next three years. The median inflation projection is 1.5 percent this year, rising to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.The FOMC's economic projections remain similar to those made in September, with slightly stronger GDP growth, a lower unemployment rate, and unchanged inflation. The Committee believes that a modest increase in the federal funds rate is appropriate given the progress towards their employment and inflation goals, and they expect gradual increases in the rate over time to achieve and maintain their objectives.Changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook, but it is too early to know how these policies will unfold. These changes are just one of many factors that can influence the outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy, which will continue to be assessed based on economic conditions and objectives.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Why does the Fed now see three rate increases next year instead of two? Is it because the economy is at risk of overheating, or is the Fed behind the curve, or is this a reaction to Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election?\n'ANSWER': The adjustment in the path of the federal funds rate is very modest and only some participants made changes. Factors considered include a slightly lower unemployment rate, slight upward revision to inflation, and some participants incorporating assumptions of fiscal policy changes. These shifts are very small.", "'QUESTION': Do individual and business tax cuts increase the productive capacity of the economy? And how would the Fed's reaction be different to fiscal policies that increase the productive capacity of the economy and those that don't?\n'ANSWER': Increasing the productive capacity of the economy is important due to low productivity growth. Policies that enhance education, training, workforce development, investment, innovation, competition, and the formation of new firms can improve productivity. The impact of tax policies on productivity depends on the specifics. The Fed's response to policy changes would depend on the details and their likely effect on the economy.", "'QUESTION': If fiscal policy does not increase the productive capacity of the economy, would the Federal Reserve have to raise rates more quickly?\n'ANSWER': It is difficult to generalize because tax policies that increase productivity can affect the economy's neutral rate. Boosting productivity could stimulate investment, but the neutral federal funds rate is currently low due to slow productivity growth. Therefore, the impact on the neutral rate would need to be considered.", "'QUESTION': What will be the impact of the rate hike and three additional hikes next year for the average American, and should they feel more confident in the economy?\n'ANSWER': The rate hike reflects our confidence in the economy's progress and its resilience. It will have a relatively small effect on market rates and could slightly increase short-term interest rates and borrowing costs. Overall, households and firms will see modest changes, but it's important to understand that the US economy is strong, making progress towards inflation and unemployment goals, with a strong labor market and resilience.", "'QUESTION': Is there a risk that the Federal Reserve is already behind the curve, even before any fiscal impact steps in next year?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve believes that policy remains accommodative, but only moderately so. Inflation is still below the objective and the unemployment rate is projected to be just slightly below the estimated longer-run normal level. There is no substantial evidence of upward pressures on labor or extreme labor shortages that could rapidly increase inflation. The outlook is uncertain, and adjustments will be made as conditions and economic policy changes evolve.", "'QUESTION': How much fiscal stimulus does the economy have capacity for right now without risking overheating?\n'ANSWER': With a low unemployment rate and a solid labor market, fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus for full employment. However, the appropriate stance of policy should consider factors such as spurring productivity growth and the rising debt-to-GDP ratio due to an aging population.", "'QUESTION': Why couldn't fiscal policy serve the same end as running a high-pressure economy in terms of drawing more Americans into the workforce?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen clarified that she never advocated for running a high-pressure economy. She mentioned that the research question is whether a strong labor market could lead to long-lasting improvements in labor force participation and productivity. The current projections show a modest undershooting of normal unemployment levels, which is appropriate to address inflation and attract more people into the labor market.", "'QUESTION': How comfortable are you with possible interference on Fed policy by the incoming President and do you feel that his tweets about individual companies could distort corporate decision-making?\n'ANSWER': I'm not going to offer the incoming President advice on policy conduct. I believe in the independence of the Fed, given to us by Congress to make decisions on monetary policy. We will stay focused on our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and inflation.", "'QUESTION': Has the Fed been asked to provide advice on overhauling financial regulation and what advice would you give to the President-elect?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has been in touch with the Trump transition team and shares the objective of ensuring a smooth transition. Chair Yellen has not been in touch beyond that and does not expect to be.", "'QUESTION': What advice would you give about how the system should be improved?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen did not provide a direct answer to the question.", "'QUESTION': What is the Federal Reserve's stance on financial regulation?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve believes that the steps taken since the financial crisis have resulted in a safer and stronger financial system. They have increased capital and liquidity requirements, performed stress tests, and placed tough regulations on systemically important firms. They also aim to relieve regulatory burden on community banks and smaller institutions while ensuring an orderly resolution process for any failures. Some changes could be made, but it is important to keep the current regulations in place.", "QUESTION: Did the FOMC discuss the reaction of financial markets to the election of Donald Trump and how it might affect the economy and monetary policy?\n\nANSWER: The FOMC did discuss the reaction of financial markets to the election of Donald Trump. There is considerable uncertainty about how economic policies may change and what effect they will have on the economy. The FOMC will factor these policies, along with other factors, into their outlook and determine an appropriate response. The market moves suggest that many anticipate expansionary fiscal policies, higher interest rates, and a stronger dollar. However, changes in understanding may also affect market prices in the future.", "'QUESTION': When do you think the slack in the labor market will have worked its way through so we're no longer talking about it at press conferences and it's not such a big issue?\n'ANSWER': It is difficult to judge precisely when the slack in the labor market will be fully resolved. The unemployment rate is currently slightly below the estimated normal longer-run rate of 4.8 percent. Broader measures of slack, such as the U-6 measure, have also decreased considerably. Overall, the labor market is comparable to pre-recession levels in terms of job openings, hires rate, quits rate, and difficulty of hiring workers.", "'QUESTION': Given President-elect Trump's criticism of your low-rate policy, would you like another term as Fed Chair and would you stay on the Committee if you were not Fed Chair?\n'ANSWER': I was confirmed by the Senate to a four-year term and I intend to serve it. The term of the Fed Chair was not meant to coincide with that of the President to ensure the independence of the Fed. I haven't made any decision about the future and I recognize that I might or might not be reappointed.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about the possibility of a bubble in equity prices and the potential financial instability it could create?\n'ANSWER': I don't want to comment on the level of stock prices, as they may have been influenced by expectations about tax policy and economic growth. Market participants are considering these factors along with interest rates when valuing stocks, but I won't offer an opinion on whether they are appropriate.", "'QUESTION': Is the Dow 20,000 within historical norms and are you comfortable with it?\n'ANSWER': Considering the low level of interest rates, rates of return in the stock market remain within normal ranges.", "'QUESTION': Does the feeling of progress in making banks more secure extend to the culture of the banks and do you think more needs to be done in that area?\n'ANSWER': There have been compliance failures at large organizations, leading to enforcement actions by banking regulators. The importance of a culture of compliance has been emphasized and the Board will be reviewing compliance and management of compliance risk in the largest corporations. There is room for improvement in this area.", "'QUESTION': Are you distancing yourself from the idea of running the economy hot?\n'ANSWER': I didn't draw any policy conclusions from the idea of running the economy hot. I raised the question of whether hysteresis could operate in the opposite direction and it was a research question for economists to investigate. The Committee's current path involves a modest degree of undershooting of normal unemployment levels.", "'QUESTION': Is it a prerequisite for the market to anticipate rate hikes before they happen?\n'ANSWER': It is not a prerequisite, but the Federal Reserve tries to explain their views clearly to market participants. While it is not necessary, if there is good communication between the Fed and the market, it is likely that rate moves will be well anticipated. In this case, the market correctly anticipated the rate hike based on progress in the labor market and inflation.", "'QUESTION': What are two or three concrete steps that could be taken to increase manufacturing employment in the United States? And what do you think about the worker assistance provided to workers who lose their jobs to trade?\n'ANSWER': Manufacturing employment depends on the progress of the economy, and there has been some recovery in this sector. Technological change has also played a role in reducing manufacturing employment. It is important to provide ways for workers harmed by globalization and technology to be retrained for new jobs, although the sufficiency of specific programs is not addressed.", "'QUESTION': Under what circumstances would the Fed remove or wind down its balance sheet?\n'ANSWER': The Fed plans to diminish the size of its portfolio by ceasing reinvestments of principal rather than selling securities. Once the normalization of the federal funds rate is well underway, the Fed would likely allow the portfolio to run off. The decision depends on the economy's momentum and possible downside risks. The process would take several years and result in a substantially smaller balance sheet.", "'QUESTION': Is the unexpected outcome of the election causing the Fed to think differently about how they evaluate the economy?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has long been aware of disturbing trends in the economy, such as rising wage and income inequality. These trends are not new, but the recession exacerbated them. While the Fed's policies can affect economic activity and inflation, policymakers should also address these trends and think about policies to address them."]}
