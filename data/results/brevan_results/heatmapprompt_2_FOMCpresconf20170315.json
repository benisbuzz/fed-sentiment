Jason Lange with Reuters.   You mentioned that you don\u2019t\u2014that you don\u2019 t\u2014you want to not have to raise rates rapidly if you were to fall behind the curve.  In the current context, \u201c gradual \u201d has been very, very gradual.  Could you describe what a rapid rate of increases should be\u2014how that should be understood? \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I \u2019m not sure that I can tell you what \u201c a rapid rate of increases \u201d is.  I think the trajectory that you see is the median in our projections , which, this year, looks to a total of three increases.   That certainly qualifies as gradual.  My comfort in using the term \u201cgradual \u201d comes back, in part, to my judgment that the neutral  level of the federal funds rate\u2014namely , the level of the federal funds rate that would  keep the economy operating on an even    keel, that it\u2019 s a rate where we neither are pressing on the brake nor pushing down on the accelerator \u2014that level of interest rates  is quite low.   So, at present, I see monetary policy as accommodative\u2014namely, the current level of the federal funds rate is below that neutral rate, but not very far below the neutral rate.  We\u2019re closing in, I think, on our employment objective.  We \u2019re coming closer on our inflation objective.  As we reach those objectives, and particularly in light of the fact that we see the risks to  the outlook as roughly balanced at this point \u2014and that \u2019s been our assessment for the last several meetings \u2014it looks t o us to be appropriate to gradually raise the federal funds rate back in the direction of neutral.  And exactly how many increases is that?  You know, the SEP gives you a sense of what Committee participants envision in a concrete sense .  But, you know, if it\u2019s one more or one less, I think that  still\u2014that  still qualifies to my mind as gradual, I think , if you compare it with any previous tightening cycle .  I remember when rates were raised at every meeting starting in mid -2004.  And I think people thought that was a gradual pace, a measured pace.  And we \u2019re certainly not envisioning something like that.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Both the OECD and the IMF have raised their forecast s, in part because of \u2014for the U.S. growth\u2014in part because of the p olicies expected from the new A dministration , yet the Fed has not .  And I take it from your comment at the very beginning that this \u2014these forecasts today represent no reassessment.  Has the Committee discussed what policy might look like in the event that there are large tax cuts passed or infrastructure spending passed?   And what might policy look like if those policies become law?   Finally, why did you remove the word \u201conly\u201d before the word \u201cgradual \u201d when you talked about future rate increases?            \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we have not discussed in detail potential policy changes that could    be put into place, and we have not tried to map out what our response would be to particular policy measures.  We recognize that there is great uncertainty about the ti ming, the size, the character of policy changes that may be put in place a nd don\u2019 t think that that\u2019 s a decision, or a set of decisions, that we need to make until we know more about what policy changes will go into effect.   So I do want to emphasize that, while some participants have penciled in some fiscal policy changes into their projections, that the basis for today \u2019s decision is simply our assessment of the progress of the economy against our long -established goals of maximum employment and price stabi lity.  There \u2019s nothing that we  have done or anticipate that is a speculation.  I think it \u2019s fair to say , there\u2019 s nothing that \u2019s a speculation about preemptive responses to future policy moves.  We have plenty of time to see what happens.  We did remove the word \u201conly\u201d in the statement today from \u201c gradual. \u201d  I think this is something that shouldn\u2019 t be overinterpreted.  I regard it as a relatively small change and think it\u2019s appropriate for you to consider it in the context, for example, of t he fact that our economic projections are virtually identical to those that we issued in December.  They \u2019re essentially unchanged both in terms of the path of the economy and the path of the federal funds rate.  So we have carried out a modest adjustment o f the federal funds rate because we\u2019 ve seen the economy progressing over the last several months in exactly the way that we anticipated.  We haven \u2019t in any way changed our view about where the economy is heading or the risks.  We had long said that if the economy progressed, and\u2014it\u2019 s, you know, it \u2019s been doing nicely, I think, in making progress, in showing resilience , and we have, you know, have some confidence in the path the economy  is on.  And if we continue to feel that, we will likely regard it a s app ropriate to make some further moves to scale back accommodation to move toward neutral , along the lines in the SEP.    Now, obviously, there are surprises.  Our economic forecast s can change.  But the word \u201cgradual, \u201d I think, emphasizes that if things continue in the manner that we\u2019 ve been going, as we have said now for quite some time, we think that  gradual \u2014some gradual increases in the federal funds rate \u2014will be appropriate.

Speaking of fiscal policy, have you had a chance to meet with the new Treasury Secretary yet, Mr. Mnuchin?  If not, when will you meet with him?  What do you want to talk to him about?  And, separately, have you had a chance to talk to President Trump yet or meet with him?  And, if not, would you like to, and would you, and what would you talk about?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: I\u2019ve met a couple of times with the Treasury Secretary, and I \u2019m getting to know him.  And I think, you know, it \u2019s traditional for F ed Chairs and Treasury Secretaries to meet on a regular basis , and I fully expect to have a strong relationship with Secretary Mnuchin.  We  have had very good discussions about the econom y, about regulatory objectives, the work of the FSOC, global economic developments , and I look forward to continuing to work with him.  I was introduced to the President.  I had a very brief meeting and appreciated that as well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Ana Swanson, the Washington Post.  You said that the neutral level of the federal funds rate is quite low.  How close do you judge it to be to the inflation rate?  And what do you anticipate will be the force pushing up the neutral interest rate over the next few years ?  Could fiscal policy be among those?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  So I \u2019ve given a number of recent speeches on this topic where I \u2019ve developed my views more fully.  I would say, over the longer run\u2014that means going several    years out \u2014I think the evidence suggests that the neutral rate may be something , in real terms , that might be close to 1 percent or a little bit under that.  That would be consistent with the median longer -run value of the federal funds rate in our economic projections for the last several meetings.  Three percent is the longer -run normal federal funds rate that participants estimate .  In real terms , with a 2 percent inflation objective \u2014that \u2019s 1 percent in real terms.  And I \u2019ve indicate d\u2014why is it so low?  Well, I think there \u2019s very strong evidence tha t\u2019s accumulated that this rate has been falling not just in the United States, but in many advanced nations , and the decline probably predates the financial crisis.  I think in part it reflects slowing population growth and also slow productivity growth he re and in many other advanced nations.  But some recent work suggests that, at the present time, the neutral real rate is yet lower than that , and some estimates place it around zero in real terms.  So I think the lower current rate arguably reflects headw inds that are left over from the financial crisis.   One form of headwind, I think, has been caution and restraint and risk aversion on the part of households and businesses that \u2019s held back spending decisions.  And, I suppose, my judgment that it \u2019ll move u p over time reflects a notion that part of that will gradually dissipate over the years.  So that \u2019s a sense of where I think \u2014now , there is uncertainty about the neutral rate.  And, as you mentioned, it is \u2014it can be affected by shifts in fiscal policy.  How the neutral rate i s affected by fiscal policy \u2014that really depends importantly on the nature, the size of the fiscal shift and the effect it has both on demand and supply in the economy.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, between the release of the minutes of the previous meeting late last month and your speech in Chicago earlier this month, market expectations about an increase in rates today changed quite dramatically.  What happened over the course of thos e two weeks to make officials far more    interested in signaling the idea of raising rates at today \u2019s meeting?  And why do you think the market was so out of sync with where the central bank was?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  So, when I look at our sequence of communications, they seem to me to have been reasonably consistent over this entire period.  We had indicated in December that we expect \u2014we saw the risks as balanced , and if the economy continued to progress along the lines we expected, that several rate increases wou ld likely be appropriate.  The minutes of our January meeting indicated that many participants thought that an increase in the f unds r ate would be appropriate fairly soon if things continued along those line s.  I indicated in my c ongressional testimony tha t I thought that, indeed, the economy was progressing in line with our expectations.  And, as I think all of us \u2014having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progress along the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced \u2014do regard it as appropriate to gradually remove accommodation that \u2019s in place by  having several interest rate increases this year .  As we saw the data continue to come in in line with our expectations , my colleagues and I spoke out and indicated that, indeed, that had been and continued to be our expectations.  Now, you know, when you ask me, how did we get out of sync with the market, this is something I tried to reflect on a bit in the remarks I made in Chicago.  And, of course, it is true that in 2015 and in 2016 each, we raised the federal funds rate only once , and perhaps market participants have been influenced by that pattern.   I did try to explain the reasons why we had moved so slowly during those two years.  And it reflects, I think, a set of s hocks partly emanating from the global economy and risks that we saw to the outlook as well as more fundamental assessments \u2014reassessments pertaining to the neutral level of the federal funds rate and the longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate.  S o I think there are reasons, but it is    important for the public to understand that we \u2019re getting closer to reaching our objectives ; that policy is accommodative ; that although the level of the neutral federal funds rate is probably quite low, we nevertheless have an accommodative stance of policy ; and it will be appropriate to gradually move toward a neutral stance if we continue on the path we \u2019re on.

So I think the higher level of stock prices is one factor that looks like it \u2019s likely to somewhat boost consumption spending.  We also noticed that, in the last several months, that risk spreads , particularly for lower -grade corporate issuers , have narrowed, which is another signal that financial conditions have become somewhat easier.  Now,  on the other side, longer -term interest rates are up some in recent months, and the dollar is a little stronger.   How does that net out?   There are private- sector analysts that produce financial conditions  indices that attempt to aggregate all these diffe rent factors affecting financial conditions.  And for some of the more prominent analysts and indices, I think the conclusion they  have reached is that financial conditions , on balance , have eased , and that\u2019s partly driven by the stock market.

You said you and your col leagues aren \u2019t making assumptions about stimulative fiscal policies, but many other people are.  Business and consumer confidence has jumped since the election.  Homebuilder sentiment today was at its highest level since 2005.  Are you concerned about the effects on the economy if some of these policies, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending , don\u2019 t get enacted or are delayed?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we recognize\u2014our statement actually last time noted that there had been an improvement , a marked improvement  in business and household sentiment.  It\u2019s uncertain just how much sentiment actually impacts spending decisions.  And I wouldn\u2019 t say at this point that I have seen hard evidence of any change in spending decisions based on expectations about the future.  We exchange around the table what we learn from our many business contacts, and I think it \u2019s fair to say that many of my colleagues and I note a much more    optimistic frame of mind among many \u2014many businesses in recent months.  But , I\u2019d say , most of the bus iness people that we \u2019ve talked to also have a wait -and-see attitude and are very hopeful that they will be able to expand investment and are looking forward to doing that but are waiting to see what will happen.

Oh, excuse me, Kathleen Hays from Bloomberg.  I\u2019m going to try to take the opposite side of this because \u2014on this question about market expectations and how the markets  got things wrong, and then how you say the Fed suddenly clarified what it already said.  But, for example, if the \u2014if you look at the Atlanta Fed \u2019s latest GDP tracker for the first quarter, it\u2019 s down to 0.9 percent.  We had a retail sales report that was m ixed.  Granted the, you know, upward revisions  of previous months make it look better,    but the consumer does not appear to be roaring in the first quarter, kind of underscoring the wait -and-see attitude you just mentioned. If you look at measures of labor compensation, you note in the  statement that they \u2019re not moving up, a nd, in fact, they are .  And if you look at average \u2014there are so many things you can look at.  And you yourself have said in the past that the fact that that is happening is perhaps an indication there \u2019s still slack in the labor market.  I guess my question is this :  In another sense, what happened between December and March?  GDP is tracking very low.  Measures of labor compensation are not threatening to boost inflation any time fast.  The  consumer is not picking up very much.  Fiscal policy \u2014we don\u2019 t know what \u2019s going to happen with Donald Trump.  And yet you have to raise rates now.  So what is the \u2014what is the motivation here?   The economy is so far from your forecast in terms of GDP, why does the Fed have to move now?  What does  this signal, then, about the rest of the year?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  So GDP is a pretty noisy indicator.  If one averages through several quarters, I would describe our economy as one that has been growing around 2 percent per year.  And as you can see from our projections, we \u2014that \u2019s something we expect to continue over the next couple of years.  Now, that pa ce of growth has been consistent with a pace of job creation that is more rapid than what is sustainable if labor force participation begins to move down in line with what we see as its longer -run trend with an aging population. Now, unemployment hasn\u2019 t moved that much, in part because people have been drawn into the labor force.  Labor force participation, as I mentioned in my remarks, has been about flat over the last three  years.   So, in that sense, the economy has shown over the last several years that it may have had more room to run than some people might have estimated, and that \u2019s been    good.  It\u2019s meant we \u2019ve had a great deal of job creation over these years.   And there could be \u2014there could be room left for that to play out further.  In fact, look, policy remains accommodative.  We expect further improvement in the labor market.  We expect the unemployment rate to move down further and to stay down for the next several years.  So we do expect that the path of policy we think is appropriate is one that is going to lead to some further strengthening in the labor market.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: [Inaudible]  Just quickly , then, I just want to underscore \u2014I want to ask you, so following on that, you expect it to move.  But w hat if it doesn \u2019t?  What if GDP doesn\u2019 t pick up?  What if you don\u2019 t see wage measures rising?  What if you don\u2019 t\u2014what if the core PCE gets stuck at 1.7  percent ?  W ould you\u2014 is it your view, perhaps, that if there \u2019s a risk right now in the median forecast for dots, that it \u2019s fewer hikes this year , rather than the consensus , or more?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, look, our policy is not set in stone.  It is data dependent , and we\u2019re\u2014we \u2019re not locked into any particular policy path.  Our \u2014you know, as you said, the data have not notably strengthened.  I\u2014there  is noise always in the data from quarter to quarter , but we haven \u2019t changed our view of the outlook.  We think we \u2019re on the same path , not\u2014we haven \u2019t boosted the outlook, projected faster growth.   We think we \u2019re moving along the same course we\u2019ve been on, but it is one that involves gradual tightening in the labor market.  I would describe some measures of wage growth as having moved up some.  Some measures haven \u2019t moved up, but there \u2019s some evidence that wage growth is gradually moving up, which is also suggestive of a strengthening labor market.  And we expect policy to remain accommodative now for some time.  So we \u2019re\u2014we\u2019re talking about a gradual path of removing policy accommodation as the economy makes progress    moving toward neutral.

A  regulatory question, if I may.  The Administration  has recently reiterated its support for a reinstatement of Glass -Steagall.  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has called for a \u201c21st century Glass -Steagall. \u201d  Keeping in mind that there  are no specifics on this proposal, is the fundamental idea of separating commercial banking from investment banking a fruitful line of inquiry?  Is this the right path to be pursuing? \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I \u2019ve not seen any concrete proposals along this line.  I don \u2019t really know what a \u201c 21st century Glass -Steagall\u201d  would look like.  I think my reading on the financial crisis is that that wasn \u2019t the major source of the financial crisis.  In fact, many of the problems emanated from firms that were investment banking units.  To me, an important reform in the aftermath of the crisis was to make sure that investment banking activities where \u2014that were a core part of the shadow banking system where leverage had built \u2014that those were appropriately capitalized, had appropriate liquidity , and their management was strengthened, and  that\u2019s what we have tried to do.  But, obviously, we would look at any proposals that are put forward.

I just want to know, what message are you trying to send consumers with this particular rate hike? \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: I think that \u2019s a great question .  I appreciate your asking it.  And the simple message is , the economy  is doing well.  We have confidence in the robustness of the economy and its resilience to shocks.  It\u2019s performed well over the last several years.   We  have created, since the trough in employment after the financial crisis, around 16 million jobs.  The unemploym ent rate has moved way down, a nd many more people feel optimistic about their prospects in the labor market.  There i s job security.  We \u2019re seeing more people who are feeling free to quit their jobs, getting outside offers, looking for other opportunities.  So I think the job market, which is an important focus for us, is certainly improving.  That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019 s a\u2014good labor market conditions for every individual in the United States.  We know there are problems that face, particularly , people with less skill and education and in certain sectors of the economy, but many Americans are enjoying a stronger labor market and feel better \u2014feel very much better about that.   And inflation is moving \u2014moving up, I think, toward our 2 percent objective.  And we \u2019re operating in an environment where the U.S. economy is performing well and risks seem  pretty balanced.  So I think people can feel good about the economic outlook.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News.  You emphasized in the statement that the Fed \u2019s inflation target is \u201c symmetric. \u201d  Would you be able to expand a little bit on why you did that, why it was included, how much of an overshoot would the Fed be willing to tolerate, and for how long?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, a couple of years ago, we included the word \u201csymmetric \u201d in our statement of longer -run goals , and this seemed like an appropriate time to introduce that    word into the statement because we had previously indicated that there was a shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent objective.  Now, headline inflation has moved almost back up to 2 percent.  As I indicated, a better forward -looking measure of inflation, core inflation\u2014t hat\u2019s not our target, but I think it \u2019s worth looking at because it \u2019s a better f orward -looking predictor of headline inflation \u2014I think that \u2019s still running a little bit under 2 percent, but we expect it\u2019 s going to move up to 2.  And this seemed like a good time to remind Americans that what our objective is is 2 percent inflation.  Inflation is not always going to be at 2 percent.  It\u2019s\u2014like all economic variables, it fluctuates.  Sometimes it\u2019 s going to be below 2 percent , sometimes it\u2019 s going to be above 2 percent.  We \u2019ve had a long period in which inflation has run under 2 percent.  As we move back to 2 percent, which is where we \u2019re heading, there will be some times when it \u2019s above 2 percent as well.   And it \u2019s a reminder \u20142 percent is not a ceiling on inflation, i t\u2019s a target.   It\u2019s where we always want inflation to be heading.  And t here will be some times when inflation is above 2 percent, just like it \u2019s been below 2 percent.  We \u2019re not shooting for inflation above 2 percent , but it\u2019 s a reminder that there will be deviations above and below when we \u2019re achieving our objective.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: How well can you tolerate an overshoot?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  Well, we would\u2014if there were an overshoot and it appeared to be persistent, we would put in place policies to try to bring inflation back to 2 percent.  That \u2019s the core set of princip les that we have adopted in our statement on longer -run goals and strategy.  And exactly how long it would take to get back to 2 percent would depend, in part, on what was happening with respect to employment and our other objectives.  So there \u2019s no hard a nd fast answer to that.    \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Yellen, Patrick Gillespie with CNN.   Some fiscal policy proposals, such as the border adjustment tax, would cause the dollar to strengthen significantly over a short period of time.  I realize you can \u2019t comment on the specific policy proposal, but if the dollar were to strengthen quickly over a short period of time, perhaps some 20 percent for whatever reason, what would\u2014what do you think the impact would be on the U.S. economy, particularly in exports and manufacturing?   And what do you think would be any implications for U.S. monetary policy ?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So that \u2019s a\u2014that \u2019s a difficult question to answer.  You asked that question not in an isolated way :  What would the impact of a large appreciation of the dollar be? But, as I understand it, you asked about it in the context of a border tax adjustment.  Is that right? Because the argument that is made is that what a border tax would do without an exchange rate adjustment is to raise the price of imported  goods into the United States.  And that large movement in the dollar that analysts claim would occur would essentially \u2014if it were complete, would fully offset the impact of the border tax on U.S. import goods.  So, it wouldn\u2019 t end up having an impact on U .S. inflation or GDP growth. But a question that \u2019s a very different \u2014that \u2019s a very different matter than if, suddenly , for some reason, the dollar were simply to begin appreciating by a large amount, say, because there were flight -to-safety flows into the dollar.   I mean, if \u2014if the latter were to occur, there were just a big boost in the dollar, it would tend to put downw ard pressure on inflation and would have a negative effect on U.S. export growth and tend to boost imports.  But that \u2019s a, that\u2019s a  different \u2014that\u2019s a different exercise.  I would just say , it\u2019s very uncertain exactly what would happen to the dollar.

Some Fed critics have said it \u2019s too soon to raise interest rates because wages haven \u2019t risen enough to justify a rate increase.  What would you say to that?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: .  Well, I don \u2019t\u2014I would like to see wages increase and think there \u2019s some scope for them to increase somewhat further.  But our objectives are maximum employment and inflation , and we need to consider what path of rates is appropriate to foster    those objecti ves.  Unfortunately, one of the things that \u2019s been holding down wage increases is very slow productivity growth.  And I think we are seeing some upward pressure as the labor market tightens.  I take that as a signal that we \u2019re coming closer to our maximum employment objectives.

The economy is continuing to expand at a moderate pace, with solid income gains and favorable business sentiment.Job gains have remained strong, averaging about 200,000 per month over the past three months, while the unemployment rate remains near its recent low at 4.7 percent. Broader measures of labor market underutilization also remain low, and although participation in the labor force has been relatively unchanged for three years, this steady rate is seen as a positive sign of improving conditions in the labor market. Looking ahead, it is expected that job conditions will continue to strengthen. In terms of inflation, the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose to nearly 2 percent in January, primarily driven by increasing energy prices. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, has remained stable at about 1\u00c2\u00be percent, indicating a steady outlook for future inflation.The FOMC expects inflation to stabilize around 2 percent over the next few years, in line with their objective. Economic projections show modest growth in GDP and a stable unemployment rate, while the Committee judges a modest increase in the federal funds rate to be appropriate in light of the economy's progress.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain their objectives, as the neutral nominal federal funds rate is currently low by historical standards. They anticipate that additional rate hikes will be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion, but the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is still likely to remain below previous decades' levels.The FOMC acknowledges that it is too early to determine the outcome of current policies and recognizes that fiscal policy is just one factor affecting the economic outlook. They will continue to assess economic conditions in relation to their dual mandate and emphasize that policy is not predetermined. Additionally, they will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing securities to maintain accommodative financial conditions, but have discussed potential changes to this policy in the future. No decisions have been made, and more information will be provided as it becomes available.I am available to answer any questions you may have.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Can you describe what a rapid rate of increases in interest rates would be?\n'ANSWER': I cannot provide a specific definition of a rapid rate of increases. The current trajectory, with a total of three increases this year, is considered gradual. The term \"gradual\" is based on the belief that the neutral level of the federal funds rate is low, and the current rate is below that level but not significantly. As we approach our employment and inflation objectives, it is appropriate to gradually raise the rate back towards neutral, even if it is one more or one less increase. This pace is still considered gradual compared to previous tightening cycles.", "'QUESTION': Has the Committee discussed potential policy changes in response to large tax cuts or infrastructure spending, and why was the word \"only\" removed from the statement about future rate increases?\n'ANSWER': The Committee has not discussed specific policy changes or mapped out a response to potential measures. They believe it is unnecessary until more is known about the policies that will be implemented. The removal of the word \"only\" should not be overinterpreted, as it is a small change and does not indicate a significant shift in policy.", "'QUESTION': Have you met with the new Treasury Secretary, Mr. Mnuchin? When will you meet with him? Have you talked to President Trump or met with him? Would you like to meet with him and what would you talk about?\n'ANSWER': I've met with the Treasury Secretary a couple of times and I'm getting to know him. It's traditional for Fed Chairs and Treasury Secretaries to meet regularly and I expect a strong relationship with Secretary Mnuchin. We've had good discussions about the economy, regulations, FSOC's work, and global economic developments. I had a brief meeting with the President and appreciated it.", "'QUESTION': How close do you judge the neutral level of the federal funds rate to be to the inflation rate? What will be the force pushing up the neutral interest rate over the next few years, could fiscal policy be among those?\n'ANSWER': Over the longer run, the neutral rate may be close to 1 percent or slightly lower in real terms. The decline in the neutral rate is due to factors such as slowing population growth and slow productivity growth. The current rate reflects headwinds from the financial crisis, but it is expected to gradually increase over time. The neutral rate can be affected by shifts in fiscal policy, depending on the nature and size of the fiscal shift and its impact on demand and supply in the economy.", "QUESTION: What caused the change in market expectations regarding an increase in rates and why was the market out of sync with the central bank?\n\nANSWER: Chair Yellen states that the central bank's communications have been consistent, indicating that rate increases would be appropriate if the economy progressed as expected. The market may have been influenced by the slow rate increases in 2015 and 2016, but it is important for the public to understand that the central bank is getting closer to its objectives and policy remains accommodative.", "'QUESTION': How concerned are you about the elevated level of stock prices and asset price inflation?\n'ANSWER': We do consider financial conditions, including stock prices, in our outlook. The higher stock prices are likely to boost consumption spending. Risk spreads have also narrowed, indicating easier financial conditions. However, longer-term interest rates have increased and the dollar is stronger, so the net effect is that financial conditions have eased.", "'QUESTION': What do you expect to find at the G-20 meeting in Germany? Will the group assessment be that the world economy is doing better or are there still worries about risk, such as the Fed raising rates too quickly?\n\n'ANSWER': I will exchange views on the economic outlook and explain U.S. monetary policy. The global economy is doing better and risks are more balanced, but there are still significant medium-term risks that will be discussed.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about the effects on the economy if some of these policies, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending, don't get enacted or are delayed?\n'ANSWER': We recognize the improvement in business and household sentiment, but it's uncertain how much sentiment actually impacts spending decisions. Most businesses have a wait-and-see attitude and are hopeful to expand investment, but are waiting to see what will happen. If there is a major shift in spending reflecting those expectations, it could affect the outlook, but I'm not seeing it at this point.", "'QUESTION': Is there a potential conflict between the Fed and the new Administration's economic growth policies?\n'ANSWER': The Fed does not see it as a conflict. They welcome stronger economic growth and support policies that boost productivity and raise the economy's potential to grow. They would like to see such changes implemented.", "'QUESTION': What is the motivation for the Fed to raise rates now, given that GDP is tracking low, labor compensation is not boosting inflation, and the consumer is not picking up much?\n'ANSWER': GDP is a noisy indicator and the economy has been growing around 2% per year, which is consistent with job creation. The economy has shown more room to run than estimated, and there could be further room for job creation. Policy remains accommodative and the Fed expects further improvement in the labor market.", "QUESTION: What if GDP doesn't pick up, wage measures don't rise, and the core PCE remains at 1.7 percent? Is there a risk of fewer rate hikes this year?\nANSWER: The policy is not set in stone and is data dependent. While the data haven't notably strengthened, the outlook remains the same. There is evidence of gradual wage growth and a strengthening labor market. Policy will remain accommodative for some time, allowing the economy to grow and improve the labor market.", "'QUESTION': Is separating commercial banking from investment banking a fruitful line of inquiry?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen has not seen any concrete proposals for a \"21st century Glass-Steagall\" and believes that separating commercial and investment banking was not the major source of the financial crisis.

The U.S. economy is performing well and risks are balanced, so people can feel good about the economic outlook.", "'QUESTION': Why did the Fed include the word \"symmetric\" in their statement and how much of an overshoot in inflation would they tolerate?\n'ANSWER': The word \"symmetric\" was included in the statement to remind Americans that the Fed's objective is 2 percent inflation, which is not a ceiling but a target. Inflation fluctuates and there will be times when it is above or below 2 percent, but the Fed is not aiming for inflation above 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': How well can you tolerate an overshoot?\n'ANSWER': If there were an overshoot and it appeared to be persistent, we would implement policies to bring inflation back to 2 percent. The time it would take to achieve this would depend on factors such as employment and other objectives, so there is no fixed timeline.", "'QUESTION': What would be the impact on the U.S. economy if the dollar were to strengthen quickly over a short period of time, particularly in exports and manufacturing, and what would be the implications for U.S. monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': The impact of a large appreciation of the dollar would depend on the context. If it is due to a border tax adjustment, the movement in the dollar would offset the impact on U.S. import goods. However, if the dollar were to appreciate for other reasons, it would put downward pressure on inflation, negatively affect export growth, and boost imports. The outcome is uncertain and complex.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide an update on the current state of the economy?\n'ANSWER': The economy is showing signs of improvement, with strong job growth and a decline in unemployment rate. However, inflation remains below the target rate and there are still risks to the economic outlook.", "'QUESTION': Some critics argue that it is too early to raise interest rates due to insufficient wage growth. What is your response to this?\n'ANSWER': While I acknowledge the need for wage growth, our main objectives are maximum employment and inflation. Slow productivity growth has been a factor in suppressing wage increases. As the labor market tightens, we are seeing some upward pressure on wages, indicating progress towards our employment goals. However, productivity is also crucial for wage growth."]}
