the Associated Press.   I guess the word is \u201cfinally.\u201d  The\u2014we have a sked you for so long, \u201cWhy were you  delaying?  Why were you delaying?\u201d  So, I\u2019ll ask, given de velopments around the world t hat still\u2014there is still weakness, and the inflation is still nowhere near your target.  What made  you say \u201cDo it now\u201d?  Some have   said it was because you feared a lack of credibility if you did n\u2019t move.  Did that play a role in your decision?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: We decided to move a t this time because we feel the conditions that we set out for a move\u2014namely, furth er improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation woul d move back to 2 percent over the  medium term\u2014we felt that these conditions had been satis fied.  We have been concerned, a s you know, about the risks from the global economy, and those risk s persist, but the U.S. econo my has shown considerable strength.  Domestic spending that accounts for 85 percent of ag gregate spending in the U.S. economy has continued to hold up.  It\u2019s grown at a solid pace.  And while there is a drag from net exports, from relatively wea k growth abroad, and the apprec iation of the dollar, overall, we decided today that the risks t o the outlook for the labor marke t and the economy are balanced.  And we recognize that monetary po licy operates with lags.  We w ould like to be able to move in a prudent and, as we\u2019ve em phasized, gradual manner.  It \u2019s been a long time since the Federal Reserve has raised inter est rates, and I think it\u2019s pru dent to be able to watch what the impact is on financial conditions and spending in the economy, and moving in a timely fashion enables us to do this.  Again, I think it\u2019s important not  to overblow the significance of this first move.  It\u2019s only 25 basis points.  It\u2014monetary policy remains accommodative.  We  have indicated that we will be watching what happens very c arefully in the economy in terms  of our actual and forecast\u2014our projected conditions relative to our employment and inflati on goals and will adjust policy over time as seems appropriate t o achieve those goals.  Our exp ectation, as I\u2019ve indicated, is that policy adjustments will be gradual over time, but, of course, t hey will be informed by the outlook, which in turn will ev olve with incoming data.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Madam Chair , thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Under the old regime, before you were raising r ates, it was easy to understan d within your mandate what you wanted to do.  You wanted the unempl oyment rate to fall, you wa nted inflation to rise, and it was easy for the public to judge the  success or failure of your pol icy.  Could you explain under the new regime what you\u2019re looking for?  Do you want the unemployme nt rate to stop falling?  Do you want it to rise?  And what i s it you hope for from inflatio n, which I think is a little more understandable, or is \u201cneutral \u201d itself now a policy goal?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: \u201cNeutral\u201d is not a policy goal.  It is an assess ment.  It\u2019s a benchmark that I think is usual\u2014is usefu l for assessing the stance of pol icy.  Neutral is essentially a stance of policy, a level of short-term r ates, which, if the economy w ere operating near  its potential\u2014and we\u2019re reasonably not quite a t that, but reasonably close to  it\u2014it would be a level that would maintain or sustain those condi tions.  So, at this point, polic y we judge to be accommodative.  The Committee forecasts that the  unemployment rate will continu e to decline, and I think that\u2019s important and appropriate for tw o reasons.  First of all, as I\u2019 ve indicated, I continue to judge that there remains slack in the econom y, margins of slack that are n ot reflected in the standard unemployment rate, and, in partic ular, I\u2019ve pointed to the depr essed level of labor force participation and also the somewhat abnormally high level of pa rt-time employment.  So a further decline in the unemploy ment rate and strengthening of l abor market conditions will help to erode those margins of slac k.  But also we want to see infla tion move up back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term , and so seeing above-trend growt h and continuing tightness\u2014greater tightness in labor and pr oduct markets\u2014I think that wil l help us achieve our objective as well with respect to inflation.  \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Just to follo w up, how does raising rates help get you to either of those goals?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: We have kept rates  at an extremely low level and  had a high balance sheet for a very long time.  We ha ve considered the risks to th e outlook and worried about the fact that with interest rates at zero, we have less scope to re spond to negative shocks than to positive shocks that would call for a tightening of policy.  Th at is a factor that has induced us to hold rates at zero for this long.  B ut we recognize that policy  is accommodative, and if we do not begin to slightly reduce the amount of accommodation, the odds are good that the economy would end up overshooting both our employment and inflation obj ectives.  What I\u2014we would like to avoid is a situation whe re we have waited so long that we\u2019re forced to tighten policy abruptly, which risks aborting w hat I would like to see as a ve ry long-running and sustainable expansion.  So to keep the econom y moving along the growth path  it\u2019s on with improving and solid conditions in labor marke ts, we would like to avoid a sit uation where we have left so much accommodation in place for so long that we overshoot these obje ctives and then have to tighten abruptly and risk damaging\u2014damaging that performance.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Yelle n, Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  In the sentence in your statement about g radual increases, in that sec tion, the Committee says that it \u201cwill carefully monitor\u201d progress\u2014actual and expected progress on inflation.  That\u2019s going to read like some kind of code to a l ot of people on Wall Street.  Can you describe\u2014what do you mean when you say \u201ccarefully mon itor\u201d?  And, speci fically, with  regard to what you do next, do you need to see inflation actuall y rise at this point in order to raise interest rates again?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, we recogni ze that inflati on is well below our 2 percent goal.  The entire Committee is comm itted to achieving our 2 percent in flation objective over the   medium term, just as we want to make sure that inflation doesn\u2019 t persist at levels above our 2 percent objective.  The Comm ittee is equally committed\u2014this i s a symmetric goal\u2014and the Committee is equally committed t o not allowing inflation to per sist below our 2 percent objective.  Now, I\u2019ve tried to explain\u2014and many of my colleagues have as we ll\u2014why we have reasonable confidence that inf lation will move up over time, an d the Committee declared it had reasonable confidence.  Nevertheless, that is a forecast, and w e really need to monitor over time actual inflation performance to m ake sure that it is conforming , it is evolving, in the manner that we expect.  So it doesn\u2019t mean t hat we need to see inflation re ach 2 percent before moving again, but we have expectations for how  inflation will behave.  And we re we to find that the underlying theory is not bearing out, tha t it is not behaving in the manne r that we expect, and that it doesn\u2019t look like the shortfall is tra nsitory and disappearing with tig hter labor markets, that would certainly give us pause.  And we have indicated that we\u2019 re reasonably close\u2014not quite the re, but reasonably close\u2014to achieving our maximum em ployment objective, but we hav e a significant shortfall on inflation.  And so we\u2019re calling a ttention to the importance of  verifying our\u2014that things evolve in line with our forecasts\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Just to fo llow up, do you need to see it rise?   Not necessarily get to the 2 percent goal, but in orde r to move again, do you want to see inflation measures actually moving higher?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: I\u2019m not going to gi ve you a simple formula for w hat we need to see on the inflation front in order t o raise rates again.  We\u2019ll al so be looking at the path of employment as well as the pat h for inflation.  But if incoming data were\u2014led us to call into   question the inflation forecast that we have set out, and that could be a variety of different kinds of evidence, that would certainly give the Committee pause.  Bu t I don\u2019t want to say there\u2019s a simple benchmark.  We\u2014you know, the C ommittee expects inflation \u2014over the next year, the median expectation is for in flation to be running about 1.6 per cent, and\u2014both core and headline.  So we do expect it to be moving up, but we don\u2019t expect it to r each 2 percent.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Madam Chair, C raig Torres from Bloomberg.  I \u2019d like to follow Jon\u2019s question.  The way the Com mittee describes inflation\u2014well , there\u2019s this \u201ctransitory\u201d language.  I\u2019d like to point out tha t oil prices today are at 3 6, and on June 15, they were $60.  So, this \u201ctransitory,\u201d which first  appeared in the statement in Dec ember, I believe, is lasting a long, long time, maybe longer than ma ny people\u2019s definition of \u201ctrans itory,\u201d and it could go on.  And, second, I really wonder if the Committee knows how quickly wage  increases or labor market tightness transfers into higher  prices, and that too is also a forecast.  So, my question:  What will you be willing to do if you don\u2019t see  progress toward 2 percent  inflation?  We missed the target for three years, and, you know, w hat would you be willing to do ?  And, second, would you allow inflation to bounce around betw een 2 and 3 percent the way you\u2019 ve allowed it to move under 2 percent over the past several years?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: First, let me say w ith respect to oil prices, I have been surprised by the further downward movement  in oil prices, but we do not need  to see oil prices rebound to higher levels in order for the impact on inflation to wash out.   So all they need to do is stabilize.  I believe there is some limit  below which oil prices are unlike ly to rise.  If we look\u2014to fall.  If we look at market expectations, mar ket expectations are for sta bilization and then some gradual upward movement.  So I certainly g rant that we\u2019ve had a series of shocks pushing them down,   but we\u2019re not looking for them t o revert back to the\u2014to higher levels that they were at merely to stabilize. We\u2014I would point out, you asked me , would we tolerate overshoot s.  For a number of years between 2004 and 2008, we had a s eries of increases in oi l prices that for a series of years raised inflation above\u2014again, we  didn\u2019t have a 2 percent object ive then, but\u2014raised it above 2 percent, and we judged those incr eases to be transitory as we ll and looked through them.  We do monitor inflation expectations  very carefully.  If we saw in  a meaningful way that inflation expectations were either movi ng up in a way that made it\u2014them s eem unanchored or down, that would be of concern.  And we have called attention to some slig ht downward movements in survey measures.  We are watchi ng that, but I still judge that inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored.  So, yes , we have tolerated inflation  shortfalls that we thought would disappear over the medium term j ust as we did overshoots of inf lation that we also judged to be transitory.  But we do need to mon itor inflation very carefully  because if energy prices and the dollar were to stabilize, impor t prices, our expectation is tha t both headline and core inflation would move up.  And if we failed t o see that occurring in the m anner that we expect, of course we need to take further action to reconsider the outlook and to  put in place appropriate policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: What woul d that action look like?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, you know, if the economy were disappointin g, we\u2014you know, our actions wouldn\u2019t purely be  based on inflatio n, we would als o take employment into account.  So I can\u2019t give you a simple an swer, but we would pursue a more  accommodative policy because we do\u2014certainly are committed to achieving 2 percent over the m edium term.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times .  Bill Dudley has talked about the need for the F ed to adjust policy based on the  responsiveness of financial   markets as you begin to increase rates.  You didn\u2019t talk about that today.  Is it a point that you agree with?  And, if so, what is  it that you\u2019re looking for?  H ow will you judge whether financial markets are accepting and transmitting these changes?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, there are num ber of different channels thr ough which monetary policy is transmitted to spending decisions.  The behavior of l onger-term\u2014longer-term interest rates, short-term interest rate s matter.  The value of asset pr ices and the exchange rate, also\u2014these are transmission channels.  We wouldn\u2019t be focused on sho rt-term financial volatility, but were there unanticipat ed changes in financi al conditions that w ere persistent and we judged to affect the outlook, we would of cour se have to take those into account.  So we will watch financial developments, but what we\u2019re looking at here is the l onger-term economic outlook:  Are we seeing persistent changes in financial market conditions  that would have a bearing, a significant bearing, on the outlook that we would need to take account in formulating appropriate policy?

So it\u2019s not as though I\u2019m expecting to see a marked, immed iate reaction in financial mark ets.  Expectations about Fed policy have been built into the str ucture of financial market p rices, but we obviously will track carefully the behavior of both s hort- and longer-term interest rates, the dollar, and asset prices, and if they move in persistent a nd significant ways that are ou t of line with the expectations that we have, then of course we will take those into account.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News.  Histori cally, most economic expansions fade after this long.  How confident are yo u that our economy won\u2019t slip back into recession in the near term?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So let me start b y saying that I feel confident about the fundamentals driving the U.S. economy, the  health of U.S. households, and do mestic spending.  There are pressures on some sectors of the  economy, particularly manufact uring and the energy sector, reflecting global developments and developments in commodity ma rkets and energy markets, but the underlying health of the U.S . economy I consider to be quit e sound.  I think it\u2019 s a myth that expansions die of old age.  I do not  think that they die of old  age.  So the fact that this has been quite a long expansion doesn\u2019t l ead me to believe that it\u2019s one  that has\u2014its days are numbered.  But the economy does get hit  by shocks, and there are both posi tive shocks and negative shocks.  And so there is a significan t odd, you know, probability in any  year that the economy will suffer some shock that we don\u2019t know about  that will put it into reces sion.  And so I\u2019m not sure exactly how high that probability is i n any year, but maybe at least on  the order of 10 percent.  So, yes, there is some probability tha t that could happen, and of course  we\u2019d appropriately respond, but it isn\u2019t something that is fated to happen because we\u2019ve had a lon g expansion, and I don\u2019t see anything in the underlying stren gth of the economy that would l ead me to be concerned about that outcome.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: In the event of  an outcome like that, in the m ost negative of scenarios, are there other polic y measures outside of interest rates, outside of traditional quantitative easing, that you ins ide of the Fed have discussed and contemplated for another environment like something whic h we saw throughout the Great Re cession?  Have you talked about anything that would be mor e direct to the economy?  \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, during the years in which we were\u2014you know , the economy was recovering from the Great R ecession and we put further poli cy and measures in place, we studied our policy op tions quite carefully.  As you know, commu nications policy to affect market expectations about the path of int erest rates played an importa nt role.  That\u2019s something we did in conjunction with asset purchases .  Obviously, we lowered our  overnight interest rate effectively to zero.  Now, we have  seen some foreign central ba nks, Europe\u2014the ECB and others\u2014that have taken their ove rnight rate int o negative terri tory, and that\u2019s something that\u2014I don\u2019t contemplate that we will need to do this, but it is somet hing that we could study.

What does \u201cwell under way\u201d mean in terms of normalization?  And, longer term, what are your view s on the idea that the Fed might need to have a larger balance sheet tha n historically over t he longer term?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, in our normali zation principles, which are  in effect, the Committee stated that we eventua lly want to operate with a much  smaller balance sheet of\u2014than we have at present.  The\u2014we woul d reduce the size of the balanc e sheet to essentially whatever size we needed to manage moneta ry policy effective\u2014in an effect ive and efficient way.  Now, a lot has changed since pre\u2013financia l crisis in term s of the fina ncial system, and we are studying\u2014we are engaging in a project at th is time to consider what our long-run operating framework should look like.  So I can\u2019t te ll you exactly what size of bal ance sheet we will determine is the   best to operate in an efficient and effective manner.  It might  be somewhat larger than the very tiny quantity of reserves that we had in pre-crisis.  We have n ot determined that.  We have also said that we will\u2014we expect to reduce the size of our balance s heet over time by cease\u2014diminishing or ceasing entir ely reinvestments.  And, beyond tha t, we haven\u2019t given additional guidance other than to say tha t the timing of reductions in rei nvestment will depend on economic and financial conditions.  And I s uppose the additional guidanc e we\u2019re giving today, when we say \u201cwell under way,\u201d we want to s ee\u2014as I mentioned, there are number of considerations, and the Committee has made no further  decisions about this, but as we\u2019ve discussed, the factors that will be relevant to the decision\u2014on e factor that we\u2019ve talked a bout is the desirability of having some scope to respond to an adve rse shock to the economy by low ering the federal funds rate.  And so it would be nice to have a  buffer in terms of having rai sed the federal funds rate to a certain extent to give us some meaningful scope to respond.  No w, I don\u2019t have in mind any particular level of the feder al funds rate.  It would depend on  the entire economic outlook, how robust the economy is.  But that is an important consideration for the Committee, and it means that this is not something that we expect to be turning to, to cease reinvestment very quickly.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Barnes at Fox Business, ma\u2019am.  On financi al market conditions, is there a problem  developing in the high-yield sec tor of the bond market, the junk bond sector?  As you know, last week  a mutual fund, Third Avenu e Management, halted redemptions so that it wouldn\u2019t have to\u2014because of a sharp sell off in these kinds of bonds.  Are you concerned at all, and did you di scuss in the meeting, any r isk to the financial system, a systemic risk, because of the conditions in the junk bond marke t?  And, you know, individual investors and institutions hol d trillions of dollars of these b onds, which were sold heavily   because of low rates, and did the  Fed\u2019s low interest rate polic y help lay\u2014sow the seeds for this development?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, risk spread s in the high-yield bond market  have been widening since last year, partly refl ecting falling oil prices\u2014only part ly, but partly\u2014and redemptions in high-yield bond funds have been inc reasing in recent months.  B ut Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund was a rather unusual open- end mutual fund.  It had very co ncentrated positions in especially risky and illiqui d bonds, and it had been facing ver y significant redemption pressures.  My understanding is that the SEC i s in touch with Third Avenue.   And, as you probably know, the SEC has proposed some reforms to address what\u2019s a structura l problem of liquidity mismatch in open-end mutual funds. So we continue to believe that f inancial conditions are support ive of economic growth.  We will be\u2014we have been and will c ontinue to track developments  in financial markets very carefully.  I would sa y that I think we have  a far more resilie nt financial system now than we had prior to the financial crisis and highly capital[ized] banks th at are well situated to support corporate lending.  I\u2019d also point out that many corpor ations during these years ha ve reduced their interest payments and extended their de bt profiles, and I think that sho uld help to mitigate spillovers, but we will be evaluati ng this carefully.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Ylan from the Washington Post .  You said earlier that expansions don\u2019t die of old age, but I think the ot her half of that is that it\u2019s  often central banks that kill them off instead.  So I\u2019m wondering how worried you are about the possib ility that the Fed will have to turn around after hiking rates.  O ther central banks that have tried to raise rates have had to do just that.  And how damaging you think t hat might be to the Fed \u2019s credibility?  \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, whe n you say that central banks often kill t hem, I think the usual reason that that has been true wh en that has been  true is that central banks have begun too late to tighten policy, and they\u2019ve allowe d inflation to get out of con trol.  And at that point, they have had to tighten policy very abrupt ly and very substantially, and  it\u2019s caused a downturn, and the downturn has served to lower  inflation.  So, if you don\u2019t mind my flipping the question on you, I would point out that it is because we don\u2019t want to cause a rec ession through that type of dynamic at some future date that it is prudent to begin early a nd gradually. Now, it is true that some centr al banks have raised rates and l ater turned around.  Not in every case has that reflected a  policy mistake.  Economies are subject to shocks.  Sometimes when they have raised rates, it  hasn\u2019t been the wrong thing to do, but conditions have changed in a way that they have had to rev erse policy to respond to shocks . I\u2019m not denying that there are situations where central banks h ave moved too early.  We have considered the risk of that .  We have weighed that risk ca refully in making today\u2019s decision.  I don\u2019t believe w e\u2019ll have to do it.  But, look, you  know, as I\u2019ve\u2014as the Committee has said, we\u2019re watching economic  developments closely, and we will adjust policy in whatever way is necessary to support the attainment of our objectives.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A.

Ca n you explain to average Americans what if anything might be different in the next few weeks or few mont hs for them because of this in terest rate hike?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I think the first \u2014the first thing that Americ ans should realize is that the Fed\u2019s decision today ref lects our confidence in the U. S. economy, that we believe we have seen substantial improveme nt in labor market conditions, a nd while things may be uneven   across regions of the country a nd different industrial sectors,  we see an economy that is on a path of sustainable improvement.  S o, in thinking about their labor market prospects and their financial prospects going forw ard, I hope they will take this d ecision as one that signals the FOMC\u2019s confidence that conditions will continue to strengthen a nd job market prospects will be good. It is a very small move.  It wil l be reflected in some changes in borrowing rates.  Longer-term interest rates\u2014loans that  are linked to longer-term intere st rates are unlikely to move\u2014to move very much.  Some\u2014for example , some corporate loans are lin ked to the prime rate, which is likely to move up with the fe d funds rate, and those interes t rates will adjust.  There are some consumer borrowing rates, I think c redit card rates, that are l inked to short-term rates that might move up slightly.

Is that a factor in d ecisions going forward?  Is it something that you\u2019re concerned about?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Interest rate ris k at banks is something that we  have been monitoring very carefully for quite a long time.  The community banks and smaller banking organizations that we work with\u2014part of our supe rvision has been ensuring tha t they manage appropriately for interest rate risk.  And the lar ger banking organizations that are subject to the stress tests and capital planning\u2014the scenarios t hat we have presented in each o f the last three years look at their ability to withstand what would be  much sharper increases in in terest rates than we\u2019re envisioning would happen.  But we want to make sure that if the re were sharper increases\u2014unlike our expectati ons\u2014that they would be well positioned to h andle it.

You keep  saying that the things holding back inflation are t ransitory, and yet every day  there seems to be new impulses from outside that look that they  could drive prices lower.  I g uess my question is, if in a year\u2019s time inflation remains where i t is today, would you see that as  a defeat for your theory?  And is that part of the reason why the la nguage has been upgraded in t he statement to say that you want to see actual progress towa rds your 2 percent target\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, we have sai d that we will carefully monito r both actual and expected progress.  You know, I t hink that standard Fed policy has been to look through shocks that are transitory.  Occasionall y, there are sequences of tran sitory shocks.  We have had some further declines in energy pr ices, and, you know, as I said pre viously, I do expect there is a bottom to that.  I expect we w ill be seeing it.  If we\u2014if we an alyze inflation data and conclude that, clearly, transitory inf luences are holding down inflation , I do not want to say that we would respond to that.  But if we concl uded that there were structura l factors or that there were a problem with our theory or some gl obal deflationary force that were simply persistently holding down inflation in a way that was  not transitory \u2014and I don\u2019t wan t to attach any simplistic meaning to what we would need to s ee to conclude that in the in flation data, but if we concluded that, we certainly would take ac tion to make sure we adjusted p olicy so that we attain our 2 percent objective.

There\u2019s been a lot of talk today and a lot of discussion about the downside risks facing the economy from,  you know, the global   environment, but you say in your state ment that the risks are n early balanced.  So should\u2014could you talk more about the upside ri sks that you see t o the econom y?  And, just briefly, the\u2014some Fed officials have been emphasizi ng lately the median CPIs from  Dallas and Cleveland.  How much weight do you put on those measures\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, starting wit h the median CPIs, we look at a range of statistics that bear on the inflation outl ook, and the median CPI has been  somewhat more stable and running closer to 2 percent than t he PCE, but there is a system atic gap between these two measures, and our objective is 2 per cent on the PCE price index , and so there\u2019s no simple translation.  We do have a PCE i nflation objective.  Sorry, let \u2019s see, the other\u2014the upside risks.  So I\u2014there are upside risks to the economy, and I think, you kn ow, we tend to focus on the downside risk.  It\u2019s right to do so.  We want  to be careful abo ut downside risks.  But consumers are in much healthier financial condition.  Their income prospe cts have improved.  We see them buying a lot of cars.  Housing has  been recovering very slowly,  but the demographics would point to considerable upside for  residential investment.  My ma inline forecast is for gradual recovery, but there is upside r isk there.

You just mention ed that it may be possible that structural f actors are holding down inflation as well, and the dynamic that\u2019s happening in top-line inflation i s happening in core as well.  In September, the median projection was revised down.  Again today, t he median projection was revis ed down, and this is happening at other central banks as well .  Additionally, markets see much  lower inflation in the future than central bank models do.  Within the Fed, how are you adapting y our models to look at what is now\u2014seems to be a new reality, a nd what are you learning as you  do that\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, so the reas on\u2014the main reason that we revi sed down our projection ever so slightly\u2014it\u2019s  hardly revised f or core inflat ion\u2014is because we have seen further appreciation of the dolla r that\u2019s holding down import p rices that spills over into core inflation.

There are various idiosyncratic factors that affect  core inflation\u2014for example, n onmarket price increases, which are a little bit hard to underst and, have been running at a slo w pace.  There were factors that have   been affecting inflation in medi cal care prices that may change  over time.  So there is some idiosyncratic factors.  But I pe rsonally don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a  world where inflation is being determined in a different way t han it has historically.  I see import prices and energy prices as holding down headline but also core, and I do believe it will p ick up.

Do you fear it could trigge r some financial turbulenc es abroad that could eventually hit the U.S.?  \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we are consta ntly monitoring foreign economic  developments, including those in emerging mar kets.  We understand that in the  global economy, with integrated product and capital markets, that  our fates are very much linke d, and that the performance of the U.S. economy has important spillo vers onto emerging markets and  vice versa.  We have been trying very carefully\u2014we\u2019ve made a commitment to emerging marke t policymakers that we would do our best to communicate as  clearly as we could about o ur policy intentions to avoid spillovers that might result from abrupt or unanticipated polic y moves.

The process of normalizing interest rates will proceed gradually, dependent on future economic progress towards maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.The FOMC has determined that the criteria for maximum employment have been met, as the labor market has shown significant improvement with the addition of 2.3 million jobs this year and a decrease in the unemployment rate. However, there are still some areas of weakness, such as low labor force participation and limited wage growth.Continued job gains and increased disposable income have supported household spending, particularly in the purchase of new motor vehicles. Residential investment is rising at a faster pace, although new homebuilding remains low. Business investment, excluding the drilling and mining sector, has shown solid gains. The Committee expects economic activity to continue expanding at a moderate pace with gradual adjustments in monetary policy, while labor market indicators strengthen. Although risks from developments abroad still exist, they have lessened since last summer. The Committee sees balanced risks for both economic activity and the labor market. The anticipation of ongoing economic growth and improved labor market conditions supports the Committee's confidence in inflation returning to the 2 percent objective over the medium term. Consumer price inflation has been low, but much of the shortfall from the 2 percent objective is due to energy price declines, which should dissipate over time.The appreciation of the dollar has kept import prices low, impacting inflation. However, as temporary factors fade and the labor market strengthens, the Committee expects inflation to reach 2 percent in the medium term.The FOMC projects a decline in economic growth towards its long-term rate, with the unemployment rate expected to decline slightly and then level out. Inflation is projected to be very low this year but is expected to rise in the coming years as transitory factors abate and labor market conditions strengthen. The Committee is raising the federal funds rate target due to the expectation that inflation will increase over time, and they recognize that monetary policy actions take time to affect future economic outcomes. Delaying policy normalization for too long could result in the need for abrupt tightening to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting the objective.The abrupt tightening of monetary policy could increase the risk of recession, but the initial increase in the federal funds rate should not be overstated as the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, supporting labor market conditions and inflation. The neutral federal funds rate is currently low due to persistent economic headwinds, but as these effects decline, the rate should gradually increase over time.The FOMC projects a gradual increase in the federal funds rate, reaching 2.5% by late 2017 and 3.25% by the end of 2018. Participants' individual projections may vary, but the actual path of the rate will depend on incoming economic data.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released an implementation note detailing the tools being used to raise the federal funds rate, including an increase in the interest rate paid on reserves and authorization of overnight reverse repurchase operations. These changes will take effect tomorrow, and while the aggregate cap on reverse repurchase transactions has been suspended for now, the Committee remains confident in the smooth progress of the normalization process, but will closely monitor financial market developments and make adjustments if necessary.\"The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\" \n\nSummary: The Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low until the labor market improves and inflation reaches and exceeds 2 percent. They will also continue to buy Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities until there is significant progress towards their employment and price stability goals.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': What made you decide to raise interest rates now, despite the global weakness and low inflation?\n'ANSWER': We decided to raise rates because the conditions we set for a move have been satisfied, including improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence in inflation returning to 2 percent. While there are risks from the global economy, the US economy has shown strength, and we want to move gradually to assess the impact on financial conditions and spending.", "'QUESTION': What is the Federal Reserve looking for under the new regime?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve wants to see the unemployment rate continue to decline to erode the remaining slack in the economy, such as low labor force participation and high part-time employment. They also want to see inflation move up to their 2 percent objective, which can be achieved through above-trend growth and tightness in labor and product markets.", "'QUESTION': How does raising rates help achieve the goals of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)?\n'ANSWER': Raising rates is necessary because keeping rates at zero for a long time limits the ability to respond to negative shocks. By slightly reducing accommodation, the FOMC aims to prevent the economy from overshooting employment and inflation objectives and avoid abrupt tightening that could harm economic performance.", "'QUESTION': Can you describe what you mean by \"carefully monitor\" progress on inflation and do you need to see inflation actually rise in order to raise interest rates again?\n'ANSWER': We recognize that inflation is below our 2 percent goal and the Committee is committed to achieving that objective. While we have reasonable confidence that inflation will move up over time, we need to monitor actual inflation performance to ensure it aligns with our expectations. We don't need to see inflation reach 2 percent before raising rates, but if inflation doesn't behave as expected, it would give us pause.", "'QUESTION': Do you need to see inflation measures actually moving higher in order to raise rates again?\n'ANSWER': We'll be looking at the path of employment as well as the path for inflation. If incoming data calls into question our inflation forecast, that would give the Committee pause. The median expectation is for inflation to be running about 1.6 percent, but we don't expect it to reach 2 percent.", "QUESTION: What will you be willing to do if you don't see progress toward 2 percent inflation and would you allow inflation to bounce around between 2 and 3 percent?\nANSWER: We do not need oil prices to rebound for the impact on inflation to wash out, they just need to stabilize. We have tolerated inflation shortfalls and overshoots in the past, but if inflation does not move up as expected, we will take further action to reconsider the outlook and implement appropriate policy.", "'QUESTION': What would that action look like?\n'ANSWER': If the economy were disappointing, our actions wouldn't solely be based on inflation, but also take employment into account. We would pursue a more accommodative policy to achieve 2 percent inflation over the medium term.", "'QUESTION': Is the Fed considering the responsiveness of financial markets when adjusting policy and how will they judge if the changes are being accepted and transmitted?\n'ANSWER': The Fed considers various channels through which monetary policy is transmitted, including interest rates, asset prices, and exchange rates. They focus on longer-term economic outlook and persistent changes in financial market conditions that would significantly affect the outlook, rather than short-term volatility.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that if markets don't tighten sufficiently, you may need to do more?\n'ANSWER': We have been explaining our policy strategy and do not expect an immediate reaction in financial markets. However, we will closely monitor interest rates, the dollar, and asset prices. If they deviate significantly from our expectations, we will take that into account.", "'QUESTION': How confident are you that our economy won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t slip back into recession in the near term?\n'ANSWER': I feel confident about the fundamentals driving the U.S. economy and the health of U.S. households. While there are pressures on certain sectors, I consider the underlying health of the U.S. economy to be quite sound. While there is a probability of a recession in any year, I don't see anything in the economy that would lead me to be concerned about that outcome.", "'QUESTION': Are there other policy measures outside of interest rates and traditional quantitative easing that the Fed has discussed for a more direct impact on the economy?\n'ANSWER': During the Great Recession, the Fed carefully studied policy options and used communication policy and asset purchases to affect market expectations. While the Fed doesn't anticipate the need for negative interest rates, they have considered studying it. They also have balance sheet policies and a range of direct policies as options.", "'QUESTION': Why do you anticipate keeping a large balance sheet until normalization is \"well under way\" and what are your views on the idea of a larger balance sheet in the long term?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve eventually wants to operate with a smaller balance sheet, but the size will depend on what is needed to effectively manage monetary policy. The financial system has changed since the pre-financial crisis, and the Fed is currently studying what the long-run operating framework should look like. The decision on the size of the balance sheet has not been determined yet, but it may be somewhat larger than pre-crisis levels. The timing of reducing reinvestments will depend on economic and financial conditions. The idea of having a buffer to respond to an adverse shock to the economy by lowering the federal funds rate is an important consideration for the Committee.", "'QUESTION': Is there a problem developing in the high-yield sector of the bond market, and is there a systemic risk to the financial system?\n'ANSWER': Risk spreads in the high-yield bond market have been widening, partly due to falling oil prices. Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund, the mutual fund that halted redemptions, had concentrated positions in risky and illiquid bonds. The SEC is in touch with them and has proposed reforms to address liquidity mismatch in open-end mutual funds. The financial system is more resilient now, with well-capitalized banks and corporations reducing interest payments and extending debt profiles.", "'QUESTION': How worried are you about the possibility that the Fed will have to turn around after hiking rates and how damaging do you think that might be to the Fed's credibility?\n'ANSWER': Central banks have killed expansions in the past by tightening policy too late, causing inflation to get out of control. The Fed wants to avoid causing a recession through abrupt tightening, so it is prudent to begin early and gradually. While some central banks have raised rates and later reversed, it doesn't always reflect a policy mistake. The Fed has considered the risk and believes it won't have to reverse its decision, but will adjust policy as necessary to support objectives.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain to average Americans what if anything might be different in the next few weeks or few months for them because of this interest rate hike?\n'ANSWER': The interest rate hike reflects the Fed's confidence in the US economy and its sustainable improvement. While there may be regional and sectoral variations, the overall job market prospects are expected to strengthen. Borrowing rates may see some changes, but the impact on longer-term interest rates is likely to be minimal. Some consumer borrowing rates, such as credit card rates, may increase slightly, but the overall move is small due to the already low rates.", "'QUESTION': How concerned are you with interest rate risk in banks now that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ended the zero-rate era and began the 0.25 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0093rate era? Is that a factor in decisions going forward? Is it something that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re concerned about?\n'ANSWER': Interest rate risk at banks is something that we have been monitoring very carefully for quite a long time. We ensure that community banks and smaller banking organizations manage appropriately for interest rate risk. Larger banking organizations are subject to stress tests and capital planning to withstand sharper increases in interest rates. We have concluded that their capital positions are sufficient to handle it.", "'QUESTION': If inflation remains where it is today in a year's time, would you see that as a defeat for your theory?\n'ANSWER': We will carefully monitor both actual and expected progress. Standard Fed policy is to look through transitory shocks, but if we conclude that there are structural factors or a persistent global deflationary force holding down inflation, we would adjust policy to attain our 2 percent objective.", "'QUESTION': Could you talk more about the upside risks to the economy and how much weight you put on the median CPIs from Dallas and Cleveland?\n'ANSWER': There are upside risks to the economy, such as consumers being in healthier financial condition and improved income prospects. Residential investment also has considerable upside potential. While the decline in drilling has been depressing investment spending, there is upside risk there as well. Additionally, growth in emerging markets has strengthened recently. The Federal Reserve pays attention to both upside and downside risks, but overall, they regard the risks as balanced.", "'QUESTION': How will the Fed avoid the perception of being mechanical if the data warrants successive rate hikes?\n'ANSWER': The Fed will try to avoid being perceived as mechanical by emphasizing that \"gradual\" does not mean evenly timed or equally sized rate changes. The Committee does not intend to follow a mechanical formula and will instead respond appropriately to the evolving outlook, taking into account the data.", "QUESTION: How is the Fed adapting its models to account for the lower inflation projections and the discrepancy between market expectations and central bank models?\n\nANSWER: The Fed revised down its inflation projection slightly due to the appreciation of the dollar, which affects import prices and spills over into core inflation. The Chair believes that core inflation will pick up, but there are idiosyncratic factors at play. If inflation does not unfold as expected, the Fed will make adjustments to its policy.", "'QUESTION': Are you looking into these models to see whether they need to be adapted?\n'ANSWER': We have many people studying inflation models, but I don't think they're perfect. Economic forecasting is based on theories that are not perfect and subject to uncertainty. We constantly change and improve our models, but I'm not aware of a superior model. We need to verify inflation and adjust policy accordingly.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about the negative impact that your decision could have on the emerging markets? Do you fear it could trigger some financial turbulence abroad that could eventually hit the U.S.?\n'ANSWER': We understand the interconnectedness of the global economy and the potential spillovers between the U.S. and emerging markets. We have made efforts to communicate our policy intentions clearly to avoid abrupt or unanticipated moves. While there may be negative spillovers, a strong U.S. economy also has positive spillovers. Many emerging markets are in a stronger position now, but we will monitor the situation carefully to avoid unnecessary negative impacts.", "'QUESTION': Wage growth is not quite where you would like it to be?\n'ANSWER': Chair Yellen seemed surprised by the question and did not provide a direct response.", "'QUESTION': How will wage growth impact the decision to raise interest rates next year?\n'ANSWER': Wage growth is expected in a strengthening labor market, and there is room for it to be higher. There are some signs of faster wage growth, but it is not a definitive factor in determining policy. However, it does affect the inflation outlook and the assessment of labor market slack."]}
