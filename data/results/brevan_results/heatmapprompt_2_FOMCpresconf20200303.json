Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal.  Two questions .  First, w hat changed between last week , when many of your colleagues seemed to indicate it was still too soon to tell how this might influence the outlook \u2014what changed between last week and today?  And then, how much confidence do you have that there wi ll be a quick and relatively complete recovery of economic activity after the peak of this virus has passed\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, what changed?   Of course, we \u2019ve been carefully monitoring the situation since it first became known and waiting to see how it would evolve .  And I think we \u2019ve come to the view now that this \u2014that it is time for us to act in support of the economy.  A nd once you reach that decision, we decided to go ahead.  So what changed, really , was, I would say, over the course of the last coup le weeks, we\u2019 ve seen a broader spread of the virus\u2014we \u2019ve seen it begin to spread a bit here in the United States .  But, for us , what really matters , of course , is not the epidemiology, but the risk to the economy.  So we saw a risk to the outlook for the e conomy and chose to act.  In terms of my confidence that we will return to \u2014what was your question?  Was that a question?\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: How do you expect this to \u2014the economy to recover from this ?  Do you see it as a persistent decline in activity or somet hing that will be relatively temporary and short  lived?  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: I don\u2019 t think anybody knows how long it will be.  I do know that the U.S. economy is strong, and we will get to the other side of this.  And I fully expect it will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Tankersley, New York Times.   You said that \u201c the ultimate solutions \u201d will come from others, and I have two questions about that.  First, is this a coordinated\u2014part of a coordinated action with other central banks , and should we be expecting to see more as part of that?  And , second, what would you like to see from American fiscal policymakers in response to these new threats\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Okay .  So, first question .  We\u2014we\u2019 re in act ive discussions with central banks around the world on an ongoing basis , as you would guess.  I\u2019ve been in regular contact with central bank leaders from around the world.  That will continue.  Central banks are doing what makes sense in their particular i nstitutional context s, but we \u2019re all talking to each other on an ongoing basis.  And our action today represents what we think is the right policy for us in our particular institutional context under our domestic mandate.  You saw this morning\u2019 s G-7 statem ent of finance ministers and governors , and I think that statement does reflect coordination at a high level in the form of a commitment to use all available tools, including health -care policy, fiscal policy, and monetary policy as \u201c appropriate. \u201d  So, in terms of fiscal policy, again , not our role .  We have \u2014we have a full plate with monetary policy.  N ot our role to give advice to the fiscal policymakers , but you saw the mention in the G -7 statement \u2014as \u201c appropriate \u201d as well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: The G -7\u2014Heather  Scott with AFP.  The G -7 statement seemed to indicate that \u2014I\u2019m sorry .  I was away from the mic.  Sorry, Heather Scott with AFP.  The G -7 statement seemed to indicate that \u2014that policymakers would use tools but were not going to do   anything imminent.  Does this contradict that , or is this in keeping with the action\u2014the statement by the G -7 this morning?  And , can I ask , what would cause you to make \u2014take another step?  What would you be looking for , in terms of the economic outlook or data?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So t he sense of the G -7, you know, is to \u2014we have seven countries, obviously, and different policies, different situations, different mandates \u2014a lot of overlap .  And the sense of that is to get together as a group and say at a high level  that \u201cThese are the th ings we\u2019re going to do.  W e are going to use our tools \u2014all of our tools in a strong way to\u2014to  try to support the economy.\u201d   So that \u2019s a statement of general support.   I think within that you will see actions.  Y ou\u2019ve seen our action.  And I think it \u2019s up t o individual countries \u2014individual fiscal policies and individual central banks \u2014to do what they \u2019re going to do.  I would think it will be \u2014it\u2019s possible there will be some more\u2014 more  formal considered coordination as we move forward. In terms of\u2014in terms of  moving forward, I would say that we do like our current policy stance.  We think\u2014we think it \u2019s appropriate to \u2014to support achievement of  our dual -mandate goals.  But as I said in my \u2014in my  statement, we\u2019 re prepared to use our tools \u2014tools  and act appropriately, depending on the flow of events\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: But any thing you\u2019ll be  particular ly watching that would change  that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I can \u2019t point to any one thing.  It\u2019 s always a range of things.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Heather Long from the Washington Post.  There \u2019s been some rising concern about credit markets and possible insolvencies and defaults either from businesses or individuals from the coronavirus.  Can you speak to\u2014is the FOMC talking about this?  Are we   likely to see any emergency provisions from the CRA activated or things that you normally do during, you know, a hurricane or that type of disruption to the economy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019t  see any of that happening yet.  Of course, we are\u2014we are thinking about what we  can do should those things happen.  There \u2019s no evidence of it yet.  The economy continues to perform well \u2014perform well.  As I mentioned, we do hear concerns, particularly from those most directly exposed, but there \u2019s nothing in that nature :  Financial markets are functioning in an orderly manner and all that sort of thing.  I think when it\u2014when it  comes to those sorts of issues, though, we will be \u2014the supervisors will be working with banks to assure that they work with their \u2014with their borrower s and that sort of thing.

Has the Committee discussed any other monetary policy tools , in addition to rate cuts , and the pacing and timing of when they might be appropriate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, as you know, we \u2019re in the middle of a review of all of our tools.  So if you go back a few meetings , we\u2019ve talked about what our toolkit is , and we \u2019ve put that in the minutes.  But in the current context, no.  What we discussed is the current stance of policy, is it appropriate \u2014came to the view that it was appropriate to make a change and went ahead and did that today.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Rich Miller wi th Bloomberg.  Thank you very much for having a press conference.  Can you take us  a little \u2014through the reasoning behind the rate cut a little bit more in depth?  You know, w as there a discuss\u2014 some economists say this is a s upply -side shock, you know, rate  cuts are not particularly suitable for this .  Others say , well, the supply   shock may morph into a demand shock.  I wonder if you c ould just  give us a little bit more depth on the reasoning behind the rate cut.  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure, I \u2019d be glad to.  So t he virus outbreak is something that will require a multifaceted response.  And that response will come , in the first instance, from health -care professionals and health policy experts.   It will also come from fiscal authorities should th ey determine that a response is appropriate.  And i t would be \u2014come from many other public - and private -sector actors:  businesses, schools, state and local governments.  But there\u2019s also a role for monetary policy.  Monetary policy can be an effective tool  to support overall economic activity.  We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection .  It won \u2019t fix a broken supply chain.  We get that.  We don\u2019 t think we have all the answers.  But we do believe that our action will provide a mea ningful boost to the economy.  More specifically, it will support accommodative financial conditions and avoid a tightening of financial conditions which can weigh on activity , and it will help boost household and business confidence.  That \u2019s why you\u2019re seeing central banks around the world responding as they see appropriate in their particular institutional context.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks.  Ylan Mui from CNBC.  Can you tell us what you would do if the virus ends up being contained fairly quickly?  Would you envision the Fed actually raising rates in short order if the economic damage doesn \u2019t occur the way that you potentially fear ?  And I have a second question, which is, President Trump was just tweeting about you this morning and talking about the Fed\u2019s need t o cut rates.  Did you feel any political pressure to make this move\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, on your first question, we \u2019re always going to set monetary policy at a given time in a way that we think best serves our dual -mandate goals, and it \u2019s as simple as that.  So , you know, we\u2019ll \u2014if we get to a place where we think it \u2019s an appropriate time to change   the stance of monetary policy , we won \u2019t hesitate to do that.   I would also say that it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s  very important that people understand that we wil l always make our decisions based on the best thinking we have, based on our\u2014what we learned from our outreach to businesses, nonprofits, educational institutions that we get every cycle through the Reserve B anks, and the best analysis, the best research .  We\u2019re always going to make our decisions in the interests of the American people to carry forward and try to achieve the mandates that Congress has given us.  And we \u2019re never going to consider any political considerations whatsoever.  We will not do that,  and it \u2019s very important that the public understand that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  I know \u2014you mentioned a little bit of outreach.  Some of the Fed B ank presidents were talking about last week how much they were going to listen to their contacts.  Have you gotten reports sort of from the ground from your business contacts, nonprofits , and so forth that have affected your decisionmaking?  What are\u2014what are  you hearing from all those folks?   Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: .  So we\u2019re \u2014we are hearing \u2014I would just say , the effects are at a very early stage.  But you are hearing concerns from people \u2014for example, in the travel business or the hotel business and things like that.  That\u2019s \u2014that\u2019s  what you are hearing.  But you don\u2019 t see things showing up in actual data.  You do see them showing up in, sort of , sentiment forecast indicators and things like  that.  We expect that will continue.   It will probably grow.  And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we \u2019ve come to the view that it would be appropriate for us today to move to support the economy.
