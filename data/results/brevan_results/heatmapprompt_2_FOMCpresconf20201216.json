Thank you, Michelle.  I wonder if I could start with the , the SEP.  We have \u2014unemployment now is at 6.7 , the SEP median sees, sees it falling to 5.  Headline inflation is one time 1.2, t he SEP median sees it rising to 1.8 .  And core inflation is 1.4 , and the SEP sees it rising to 1.8 likewise.  Would that constitute \u201c substantial further progress \u201d toward the C ommittee \u2019s maximum -employment and price -stability goals?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes.  Well, so we \u2019re not \u2014we\u2019re not  going to be identifying specific\u2014associating that test with , with  specific numbers at this point.  So, really, the question is, what do we mean by, by that language ?  And, really, the overarching message, Rich, is that our guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policy accommodative until our maximum -employment and price -stability goals are achieved , and that\u2019s, that\u2019s  a powerful message.   So \u201c substantial further progress \u201d means what it says.  It means we\u2019ll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum level and inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent  longer -run goal before we start making adjustments to our purchases.  I would also point out that by increasing our asset holdings, we see ourselves as adding policy accommodation.  There will come a time when the economy does not require increasing amounts of policy accommodation.  And when that time comes\u2014and that will be uncertain and, in any case, is, is some ways off.  So I can \u2019t give you an exact set of numbers.  We will\u2014of   course, as we approach that point, we \u2019ll be evaluating that.  And when we see ourselves on a path to achieve that goal, then we will \u2014we will  say so undoubtedly well in advance of any time when we would actually consider gradually tapering the pace of purchases\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Very quickly on, on  that.  You, you mentioned the next couple months are going to be very chal lenging.  And regarding asset purchases, why not increase the duration of the asset purchases at this time, given what you see as a very challenging period ahead\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, you know, again, I would start with what w e actually did at the meeting, w hich, which was, we provided this , this  guidance about the path of asset purchases.  And I just went through what, what they\u2014what they\u2014the guidance that we put forward.  And, you know, so I guess since September we \u2019ve now adopted a flexible average inflati on-targeting framework.  We have provided rate guidance that is tightly linked to the goals as expressed in that new framework.  And now we \u2019ve done the same for , for asset purchases.  So, you know, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve  been sort of \u2014as, as  the future has become clearer and as we \u2019ve absorbed new developments in medical \u2014in the medical  sphere and also in , in the economy, we have \u2014began to be able to see further.  So we \u2019ve, we\u2019ve  started to be able to provide further important guidance.  And we think that the \u2014that the  asset purchase guidance, guidance  is very important.  We think that the , the prior language of \u201cin coming months \u201d was obviously temporary.  This links that guidance, those purchases , to actual \u201csubstantial further progress \u201d toward our , our mandated goals.  We think that \u2019s important.  And we think that that is important to have done.  I, I would just add, though, that we also continue to think that our current policy stance is appropriate.  We think it \u2019s providing a great deal of support for the economy.  Fi nancial conditions are highly accommodative.  And, you know, we monitor a range of financial condition indexes.  There are many of them, and they\u2019 ll, they\u2019ll all pretty much tell you that.    You can\u2014you can also look at the interest sensitive parts of the economy \u2014for example, housing, durable sales, vehicle sales \u2014those parts of the economy are, are  performing very, very well.  The parts of the economy that are weak are the service -sector businesses that involve close contact.  Those are not being held back by financial conditions, but rather by the spread of the virus.  And I \u2019ll close by , by just saying, we do have the flexibility to provide more accommodation through the channel you mentioned and through other channels.  And we recognize that circumstances co uld shift in a way that warrants our , our doing that, including by adjusting purchases.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the  U.S. economy to achieve our goals.  We will continue to use our tools to support the economy for as long as it takes until the job is well and truly done.  No one should doubt that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Nick Timirao s, the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, a two-part question.  What , if anything, would prompt the Fed  to shift Treasury purchases toward the longer end of the curve as you did with your prior QE programs?  And does your guidance today on asset purchases  foreclose the possibility that you could, at some point , lengthen maturities while simultaneously tapering the monthly purchas e amounts \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, Nick, I\u2014on, on the first part of the question, I , I don\u2019t \u2014I wouldn\u2019 t want to sort of talk about hypothetical situations.  You know, we , we look at our overall stance of policy, w e look at overall financial conditions , we look at what \u2019s going on in the economy\u2014different parts of the economy, and w e ask ourselves, should we change our policy stance?  We do that at every meeting .  And we look at where financial conditions are now ,   and, and we , we feel that they are appropriate for now.  Anytime we feel like the economy could , could use stronger accommodation, we would be prepared to provide it.  We\u2014but r ight now, we\u2019re providing a great deal, a nd we think\u2014we happen to think it \u2019s the right amount. And, you know, you, you mentioned \u2014I think you\u2019 re referring to the idea of maintaining the duration but , but reducing the quantity, which is sort of what the Bank of Canada did.  And that, that  is something that we \u2014you know, that we talked about in the last meeting and was addressed in the minutes.  And I would say, the views on that were mixed :  Some thought it was an interesting idea, others not so much.  I , I wouldn\u2019 t say that that \u2019s something that \u2019s, that\u2019s  high on our list of , of possibilities.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Victoria Guida  with Polit ico.  I want ed to ask about the 13(3) facilities.  Chair  Powell, you\u2019 ve said that you accept Treasury Secretary Mnuchin \u2019s interpretation of the statute of the CARES Act on , on what should happen with those programs.  So, first of all, I \u2019m curious whether under a new Treasury S ecretary you will accept whatever legal interpretation they put forward for those programs.  And then, also, given that there isn \u2019t a statutory requirement for you to have financi al backing from Treasury for 13( 3) facilities, do you have any plans for any future facilities that don \u2019t requir e Treasury backing?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So on your \u2014on your  first question, we really have not thought about that.  We \u2019re, we\u2019re  very focused on\u2014we have a lot to do now.  We, we have  not focused on, on that question , and I , I really have nothing to add on that.  Your second question is \u2014sorry.  Oh, if there were no \u2014ye s.  No, we, we would have the ability\u2014certainly, we would have the ability to do facilities under 13( 3) in some cases with no backing.  But we can \u2019t do any 13( 3) faciliti es   without the approval of the  Treasury S ecretary , right?  But we did some facilities \u2014I think one of our facilities this time didn \u2019t have any Treasury backing.  And I think some in the \u2014in the  round of\u2014during the G lobal F inancial C risis also didn \u2019t have any.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: So do you have any plans \u2014like, would you consider doing more facilities if that became necessary without Treasury backing\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I would say that we are\u2014you know, we \u2019re\u2014we  have the authorities we have.  We will use them if , if they\u2019 re needed and if \u2014and if  the law permits us to do so.  We would\u2014we would  always do that.  We, we do not have any plans for , for the future about this.  We\u2014we \u2019re very focused on, on getting through year -end.  We\u2019ve been very focused on, on the issues that are right in front of us.  A nd, honestly, we \u2019re not \u2014we\u2019re not  planning on anything or having any discussions about what we might do down the road\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and happy New Year.  I know how much you enjoy talking about fiscal stimulus , so let me ask you directly about fiscal stimulus.  There \u2019s talk right now of a $900 billion fiscal stimulus program in Congress.  Is , is that sufficient?  Is that what you\u2019 re looking for?  Do you think that \u2019ll be sufficient for helping the economy?  Finally, you talked about the idea of how concerning the recent surge is.  I wonder if you can put some detail on that.  How much concern do you have in terms of , where could employment go?  What could happe n to GDP in the first quarter as a result of this  surge ?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Okay .  So on, on fiscal policy, I would just say a couple of things.  The case for fiscal policy right now is , is very, very strong.  And I think that is widely understood, I would say,  now.  The details of it are entirely up to Congress.  But with the   expiration of unemployment benefits \u2014some of the unemployment benefits, the expiration of eviction moratoriums with the virus spreading the way it is , there \u2019s a need for households and businesses to have , have  fiscal support.  And I do think that \u2014again , I think that is widely understood.  So I think it would be \u2014I, I certainly would welcome the work that Congress is doing right now.  It\u2019s not up to us to judge that work.  It \u2019s really, really theirs.  And I , I don\u2019 t have a view for you on, on the size of it.  It \u2019s\u2014you know, it\u2019s  obviously a substantial bill.  On the surge, you know, so it \u2019s a really interesting question.  We have , and others too, have consistently expected there to be more economic\u2014that , that cases would hold\u2014 growth in cases would hold back the economy more than it actually has.  So we \u2019ve overestimated the, the  effects on the economy of , of these spikes we\u2019 ve been having.  Now, this spike is so much larger that I thin k\u2014and I think forecasters generally do think that there \u2014that this will have an effect on suppressing activity, particularly activity that involves people getting together in bars and restaurants, on airplanes and hotels and things like that.  And you\u2019re starting to see that.  In the \u2014in the  high -frequency data, you\u2019 re now beginning to see that show up.  And I think if this is \u2014the case numbers are so high and so widespread across the country that  that, that  seems like it must happen.  Now, how big will it  be?  We don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019t  really know.  You know, there are \u2014there are a lot of estimates.  The general expectation is , you\u2019 re seeing some slowing now.  And you\u2019 ll see the first quarter could well be\u2014 what , what  we said is that coming months are going to be challenging.  The first quarter will, will certainly show significant effects from this.  At the same time, people are getting vaccinated now.  They \u2019re getting vaccinated.  And by the end of the first quarter into the second quarter, you\u2019 re going to be seeing significant numbers of people vaccinated.  And so then what will be \u2014how will that play into economic   activity?  Again, we don\u2019 t have any experience with this.  You have to think that sometime in the middle of next year, you will \u2014you will  see people feelin g comfortable going out and engaging in a broader range of activities.  And some people will be probably quick to do that.  Some are doing it now without a vaccine \u2014right ?\u2014in many parts of the country.  So, nonetheless, my expectation\u2014and I think many people have the expectation that the second half of next year should\u2014the economy should be performing strongly.  We should be \u2014you know, we should be getting people back to work.  Businesses should be reopening and that kind of thing.  The issue is more the next four or five months \u2014getting through the next four, five, six months.  That is key.  And , and, you know, clearly there \u2019s going to be need for help there.  And, and, you know, my sense and hope is that we \u2019ll be getting that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our  questions.  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about house prices.  They were mentioned in the most recent minutes as, you know, potential ly a valua tion concern, especially as it related to your mortgage -backed security purchases.  And you mentioned earlier today that the housing market looks more or less fully healed.  And so I guess I wonder, are you worried about valuation pressures there?  And , if so, what can the Fed  do to contain those?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, so we monitor basically just about every asset price in the economy, and housing prices are something that we \u2019ve been monitoring.  And you see them moving up.  You see very high demand.  T his, this  is the housing market that people have been expecting since , you know, 2010.  And , and then, you know , not many, when the \u2014when the  pandemic hit , thought, \u201cOh, this is what \u2014this is what  will produce that housing market ,\u201d but it has.    Now, I would say, from a financial stability standpoint, housing prices are not \u2014are not  of a level of concern right now .  That\u2019s just reflective of a lot of demand.  And, you know, builders are going to bring forth supply.  There \u2019s also a sense that this\u2014some of this may be pent-up demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand\u2014once that demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable. So it\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s a  healthy economy now.  We, we met recently with a bunch of homebui lders , and many of them in the business 30, 40 years said they \u2019ve never seen the likes of it.  But , no, housing prices themselves are not \u2014are not  a financial stability concern at the moment.  We will watch that carefully.  But in the near term, I wouldn \u2019t think that that \u2019s an issue that we \u2019d be concerned about\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman.  So with the actions that you\u2019ve  currently taken, how do you\u2014how do you further fight a slowdown that you\u2019re seeing?  We \u2019ve talked about the retail sales numbers are a little bit sluggish this month, the unemployment, the job growth has slowed down.  Is there more the Fed  can do to fight this?  Or is it now squarely in the  Congress \u2019s realm\n\nCHAIR POWELL: T here is more that we can do, cer tainly.  We can \u2014we can  expand our, our asset purchase programs .  We can focus them more on the longer end.  There are a number of options we would have to provide more support to the econom y. So I would\u2014I would say , though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn\u2019 t just from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable lags.  It\u2019s really support.  As the\u2014as\u2014we\u2019ve, w e\u2019ve talked about this as all of these government   policies trying to work together to create a bridge across this chasm, economic chasm that was created by the pandemic.  And for many Americans, that bridge is there and, and they \u2019re across it. But there \u2019s a group for , for which they, they don\u2019 t have a bridge yet.  And that \u2019s who we\u2019re talking about here.  It\u2019 s, it\u2019s the 10 million people who lost their jobs.  It\u2019 s people who may lose their homes.  It\u2019s \u2014you know, you see the, the \u2014many, many millions of America ns are, are  waiting in food lines in their cars these days all over the country.  So we know there \u2019s need out there.  We know there are small businesses all over the country that , that  have been basically unable to really function , and they\u2019 re just hanging  on.  So \u2014and, and they \u2019re, they\u2019re  so critical to our economy.  So \u2014and , by the way, now that we can\u2014we can  kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel, it would be \u2014it would be  bad to see, you know, people losing their business, their life\u2019s work in many cases, or even generations \u2019 worth of work, because they couldn \u2019t last another few months, which is what it amounts to.  So we have more we can do.  And we\u2019ll \u2014I, I think more the issue is , we\u2019re going to need to continue to provide support to this economy for quite a period of time, because the , the economy will be growing in expectation.  We should be growing at a fairly healthy clip by the second half of next year.  But it\u2019 s going to be a while before we really are back to the levels of , of labor market \u2014the, the sort of conditions in the labor market that we had in early this year and for much of the last couple of years.  So that \u2019s how I think about it.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chai r Powell.  Thanks for doing this.  And thanks, Michelle.  Two , two  quick questions.  One, on the vaccine, do you have, or has the Fed  modeled, sort of a working estimate of when the  U.S. might reach something approaching herd immunity?  And, secondly, if you could, please connect with me the lack of movement on the decision to maintain th e current pace and quantities of  bond purchases with the fact that the SEPs  are showing three years with inflation not reaching 2 percent .  Some might argue that you need to do more to start fixing those expectations, and to let this drift and say \u201c We\u2019re going to miss our target for another three years \u201d doesn \u2019t show a very firm commitment to the new framework\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , in terms of the vaccine, ye s, you know, we do estimates of , of when the United States would reach herd immunity, and they\u2019 re, they\u2019re  going to be similar to what other people think.  You know, i t depends on your assumptions, such as how many people will actually take the vaccine a nd how fast will the rollout be .  So it\u2019 s assumption based on assumption based on assumption.  But , you know, sometime \u2014it\u2019 s possible sometime in the middle or second half of next year.  I \u2019m not going to try to be precise , because it \u2019s just another estimate.  You know, our people are very good, but they \u2019re looking at , at the same data as other people are.  And so, you know, all the estimates are \u2014it depends on what your assumptions are.  But under a normal set of assumptions, it could happen as , as soon as the middle of next year . In terms of the , you know, inflation, a couple things \u2014your second question.  You know, we\u2019re \u2014I think you have to be honest with yourself about , about  inflation these days.  There are\u2014there are  significant disinflationary pressures around the world, and there ha ve been for a while , and they persist today.  It\u2019s, is  not going to be easy to have inflation move up.  And it isn \u2019t going to be just a question\u2014it\u2019 s going to take some time.  It took a l ong time to get inflation back to 2 percent  in the last crisis.    And, you know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  honest with ourselves and with you in the SEP that even with the very high level of accommodation that we \u2019re providing both through low rates and very high levels o f asset purchases, it will take some time, because that \u2019s what we believe the underlying inflation dynamics are in our economy.  And that \u2019s sort of why we \u2019re\u2014one reason why we \u2019re concerned about inflation is that we see that.  And , and that \u2019s why we have a dopted the flexible average inflation -targeting framework.  That \u2019s why we \u2019re aiming for an overshoot.  But we \u2019re, we\u2019re  honest with ourselves and with the public that it will take some time to get there.  In terms of, you know, would, would it really speed it up a lot to , to move asset purchases, y ou know, I don\u2019 t think that would really be \u2014I think it \u2019s going to take a long time however you do it.  And, you know, we \u2019ve been having very long expansions since\u2014 in, in the last several decades because inflation has not \u2014really , the old model was , inflation would come along and the Fed  would tighten, and we \u2019d have a recession.  Now inflation has been low, and we haven\u2019 t had that dynamic.  And the result has been three of t he four longest expansions in, in modern history, in recorded history.  So, you know, we\u2019re, we\u2019re  thinking that this could be another long expansion, a nd that we \u2019ll keep our \u2014what we\u2019re saying is, we \u2019re going to keep policy highly accommodative until the e xpansion is well down the tracks.  And we \u2019re not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actually reaching 2  percent  and being on track to exceed 2 percent .  That \u2019s a very strong commitment , and we think that \u2019s the right place to be.  HOWAR D SCHNEIDER.  Thank you\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Chris Rug aber.  I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Chair.  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: I \u2019m just going to add, markets have actually found this fairly credible.  If you look at what \u2014at inflation  compensation and at the survey measures of , of when the Fed will lift off , everything has moved.  There have been significant movements since we announced the framework in the direction that is consistent with the \u2014with the  framework being credible to market participants.   So I , I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s something that \u2014I, I mean, I \u2019m actually pleased by , by the reception it\u2019 s gotten in markets.  And markets have moved in ways that suggest it is credible.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, thank you.  Yesterday, I guess, the Fed  said that it is joining the international financial g reening group.  And I just wanted to see if you could expand on how the Fed  is thinking about climate change and how it might affect Fed  policy going forward.  Specifically, I think Janet Yellen drew a distinction between considering climate change when it comes to financial regulation.  But how do you see that also potentially affecting monetary policy?  Obviously, there have been criticisms of the Fed  for buying bonds of oil and gas companies.  But  leaving that specific case aside, I mean, are there\u2014 is there any way that climate change considerations could affect monetary policy going forward?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So the \u2014you\u2019 re, you\u2019re  talking about the \u2014sorry, the Network [of Central Banks and Supervisors ] for Greening the Financial System,  which we joined this week.  And I \u2019ll just \u2014I\u2019ll just say a couple things about that.  So , first, I \u2019ll just start by saying that we \u2019re going to move carefully and thoughtfully on developing an understanding of how climate  change affects our work, including the areas you mentioned.  We\u2019re going to do so with a great deal of engagement with all of our external constituencies, including the public and their elected representatives who are charged with our oversight.  We \u2019ll do it with great transparency.    Remember that we are a nonpolitical agency whose goals and authorities to achieve those goals are set by Congress.  We have great responsibilities and strong authorities that we\u2019 ll use vigorously.  We\u2019re not the forum where all the great issues of the day are to be hashed out, debated , and addressed unless and only to the extent that those issues are directly relevant to our statutory goals and are addressable through our legal authorities.  And because we have a narrow remit, a nd because we stick to it, Congress has given us a precious grant of independence from direct political control.  So society\u2019 s broad response to climate change is for others to decide\u2014 in particular, elected leaders.  But\u2014so let me \u2014let me get to your question.  What does all that mean for an issue like climate change?  And why did we join the NGFS?  So Congress hasn\u2019 t explicitly assigned us or other financial regulators a role , and we \u2019re not among the agencies who contribute to the National Climate Assessment \u2014Climate Assessment , for example.  But climate change is nonetheless relevant to our existing mandates under the law.  And let me tell you why. One of our jobs is to regulate and supervise banks and to look after the stability of the financial system.  That \u2019s a responsibility we share with other agencies.  The public will expect that we will \u2014we will  do that.  So we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll  expect that , that  those important institutions will be resilient against the many resists \u2014risks that they fake\u2014face:   credit risk, market risk, cyber risk.  Climate change is an emerging risk to financial institutions, the financial system , and the economy.  And we are, as so many others are, in the very early stages of understanding what that means, what needs to be done about it, and by whom.  That \u2019s why 83 central banks have joined together to share research and identify best practices in this important emerging area.  We\u2019ve been attending NGFS meetings as an observer for more than a year, taking part in the w ork.  We had discussed that it was probably time to join as a member.    I\u2019ll just say that the financial system is really a global one.  It \u2019s important that we work and discuss best practices with peer agencies around the world , especially in a field where w e\u2019re just beginning to develop our , our understanding. You asked about monetary policy.  You know, I \u2014I\u2019ll say  this.  We, we have historically shied away strongly from taking a role in credit allocation.  In fact, our agreement with Treasury during the financial crisis from back in 2009 or \u2019 10 says that we will avoid credit allocation.  It\u2019s something we \u2019ve carefully avoided.  So I , I would be very reluctant to see us move in that direction, picking one are a as creditworthy and another not.  So you asked about monetary policy.  Y ou know, it\u2019s , it\u2019s\u2014for now , I would say the real\u2014the real  concern is \u2014the real place to focus,  for me , is supervision of financial institutions and then financial stability concerns.  You can see a connection there.  Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices \u2014it\u2019 s less obvious to me.  I can \u2014I can, you know \u2014I can make the argument, but it \u2019s less obvious to me that those should be first -order things that we would look at in conne ction with climate change.  But I think there \u2019s\u2014I think there\u2019s  work to be done to understand the connection between climate change and the strength and resilience of financial markets and financial institutions.  I think that work is in its early days.  A nd, again, we\u2019ll be careful .  We\u2019ll be thorough and transparent and, and engage with the public on all that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  And thank you, Michelle.  I wanted to ask specifically about state and local aid.  J ust as one example, the governor of Illinois announced roughly $700 million in early anticipated budget cuts to close the budget d eficit , and the latest bipartisan stimulus proposal that \u2019s being debated this week   seems to be leaving out state and local aid at this point.  And I \u2019m just curious if you can give some detail about the damage that these budget deficits or the lack of aid s pecifically to state and local governments will have on the recovery  and, specifically , with the m unicipal l ending f acility set to expire, what more the Fed  might be able to do to fill that specific hole.  Thanks very much.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Okay.  So the sta te and local governments, they provide important critical services:  safety, fire, police, health, all kinds of things like that.  They \u2019re, they\u2019re  really involved in people \u2019s lives, state and local governments are, to , to a large extent.  The decision whether to , to provide more fiscal support to them is entirely in the hands of Congress.  And , you know, they\u2019 re in th e middle of these discussions, a nd, and those , those  are issues for them to decide.  I would say that the picture is mixed.  What \u2019s happened is, if you\u2019 re a state that has a significant exposure to tourism or to extracting energy from the ground\u2014 oil from the ground, or gas\u2014you are probably, at least in those industries , feeling a significant loss of revenue.  A number of other states have been surprised on the upside, where \u2014and that \u2019s because goods  sales, for example\u2014property taxes are\u2014don\u2019 t move much year to year.  And, you know, the kind of sales taxes on goods \u2014goods  sales have been very high.   Income has been more or less replaced by, by  the CARES Act \u2014fully replaced , more than, in many cases.  So the concerns that we had at the very beginning of really serious , deep shortfalls and massive budget cuts on the part of state and local governments have not yet \u2014have not yet  occurred.  What w e\u2019re seeing is, is that it\u2019 s different state to state.  And some states are having significant difficulties, others not so much.  The real concern , though , that still emerges is , state and local governments are very large employers, and\u2014one of the largest.  And so far, since the pandemic began, employment has   dropped by 1.3 million in\u2014of  state and local government.  So it \u2019s, it\u2019s a very large number of people to be \u2014to be  out of work from just that one source.  It\u2019s actually significantly more than lost their job s during the Global F inancial C risis.  So that is \u2014that is  a significant \u2014a significant  part of that group is , is in education.  So when the schools reopen, a significant part of that 1.3 million would go back to work.  Nonetheless, it \u2019s a concern.  We\u2019re, we\u2019re watching carefully to understand why that \u2014why that  many people have been let go and what are \u2014really are the sources.  So we \u2019re monitoring it carefully, and it \u2019s a mixed picture.  And I , I just have to leave the question of what to do with fiscal policy  on this to Congress.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell.  You and the Fed  have consistently said that the Fed  is ready to provide the economy with more monetary support if needed a nd really stressed to policymakers generally that the dangers of not doing enough outweigh the risks of doing too much in a situation where there \u2019s so much suffering in the economy.  The guidance today sort of cements asset purchases for a longer period of  time but is  not a big new easing step.  Why was now , with the short -term outlook deteriorating due to the new coronavirus surges, not the moment for a big new easing step?  And is it because of the medium- term outlook improving?  Or is it because the Fed  just doesn\u2019 t have the capacity to sort of build that bridge over the next four to five months for the \u2014for the  people who are struggling?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Right .  So I, I could go back, James, to what I said earlier, which is , this is \u2014this is  a very, very lar ge asset purchase program.  It\u2019 s providing a tremendous amount of, of support for the economy.  If you look at the interest- sensitive parts of the economy, they\u2019 re performing very well.  The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from high   interest rates.  They \u2019re struggling from exposure to, to COVID, i n a sense .  These are \u2014these are the businesses that , that  are really hit hard by people \u2019s reluctance to gather closely . So, so we , we do have the ability to \u2014you know, to buy more bonds or to buy longer -term bonds.  And , and we may \u2014we may  use it.   I\u2019m not saying we won\u2019 t\u2014we won\u2019t  use that .  It may well come to , to using that.  But also, I would remind \u2014I would  also note , though, monetary policy works with \u201c long and variable lags, \u201d is the famous statement.   So we think that the big effects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future.  So this looks like a\u2014you know, it looks like a time when what is really needed is fiscal policy.  And , and that\u2019s why it is , is a very positive thing that, that  we\u2019re getting that.  So we , we remain open to doing\u2014you know, to, to either increasing the size of our asset purchases, if that turns out to be appropriate, or to just moving the maturities, moving to buying longer maturities , because that had \u2014that also increases accommodation by taking more duration risk out of the market.  But we think our current stance is appropriate.  And we think that our \u2014you know, that our , our guidance on asset purchases today will also provide support to the economy over time.  Again, what we \u2019ve\u2014what we\u2019ve  done is , we\u2019ve laid out a path whereby we\u2019re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until \u2014really until we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know , not really the way it \u2019s been done in the past.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  providing significant support for the economy now. We don\u2019 t think the economy suffers from a lack of , of highly accommodative financ ial conditions.  We think it \u2019s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity.  And we expect that , that  with the virus, that that will improve \u2014that condition will improve.  Nonetheless, again, we will\u2014ar e prepared to use our   tools , and we will use them at such time and in such amounts as we\u2014as we think would, would help.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Some forecasters have suggested that there is  a lot of pent -up demand for travel and entertainment and, and services and the like that might stop being pent up in a hurry if we do get to a point where the vaccine is widely distributed, a nd that the beaten -down service sector might have trouble meeting that demand in, in a hurry.  How might that affect inflation , in your mind?  And would that be just a transient problem or , or something that might warrant closer scrutiny?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So that , that  has all the markings of a transient  increase in the price level.  So you can imagine that as people really want to travel again\u2014let \u2019s say, you know , that airfare, airfares \u2014I\u2019m just imagining this, right ?\u2014that they go up.  But what inflation is, is a process whereby they go up year upon year  upon year upon year.  And if \u2014given the inflation dynamics that we \u2019ve had over the last several decades, just a single, single  sort of price -level increase has not resulted in ongoing price -level increases.  And that , that  was\u2014the problem back in the 1970s was , it was the combination of two things.  One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up.  But the second problem was that that \u2014that that increase was persistent, there was a level of persistence.  So if prices went up 6 percent  this year, they \u2019d go up 6 percent  next year, because people would internalize.  I mean , really, really , that \u2019s what happens is , people internalize that they can raise prices, and that it \u2019s okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate.  So  that was the inflation \u2014those are the inflation dynamics of that era.    Those dynamics are not in place anymore.  The re\u2014the  connection between low unemployment or other resource utilization and inflation is so much weaker than it was.  It \u2019s still there , but it \u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a  faint heartbeat compared to what it was.  And  the persistence of inflation, if you\u2014if you get a \u2014for example, oil prices go up, a nd that \u2019ll send a temporary shock through the economy.  The persistence of that into , into inflation over time is  just not there.  So they\u2014what you describe may happen, a nd, of course , we would watch it very carefully.  We , we understand that we will always be learning new things from the economy about how it will behave in certain cases.  But I would\u2014I would expect , though, going in that that would be a one-time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: So not the kind of thing that the Fed  would , would be trigger -happy to, to\u2014\n\nCHAIR POWELL: No\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: \u2014 respond to?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: No, no.  Definitely not.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: [Inaudible] \u2014question.  But w hat I wanted to ask was, you know, given the size of all the government borrowing and, you know, different regulatory changes in the financial sector, do you think that the Treasury market , long run, can operate smoothly without some sort of active Fed  presence\u2014you know, buying Treasury debt?  You know, I \u2019m referring back to [inaudible] Randal Quarles.  He  had some questions  about it .  So I wanted to know where you stood on that issue.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right.  So \u2014you we re breaking up a little.  I think \u2014I think  I got the sense of it, though.  Ye s, I, I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s at all a foregone conclusion that there needs to be a   permanent Fed  presence.  And we certainly don\u2019 t\u2014you know, that \u2019s not something we \u2019re planning on or intending.  Right now we \u2019re buying assets because it \u2019s a\u2014 you know, it \u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a  time when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our asset purchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balance sheet.  You know, there \u2019s lots of demand for , for U.S. Treasury paper all \u2014from all over the world.  And I , I think we need to be thoughtful about the structure of the Treasury market and look at ways to make sure that the capacity is there for it to be handled by the private sector.  And there \u2019s, there\u2019s  quite a lot of work going on on that front .  But I , I don\u2019t presume at all that, that this is something that needs to be \u2014where the Fed  needs to be in there at all.  I , I would think that this should be handled by the private sector and can be.  Institutions need to be able to hold this paper .  And there may be \u2014there may be  a central clearing angle that would, you know, net a lot of risk.  That\u2019s, that\u2019s  yet to be proven.  There are a lot of things that are being looked at right  now.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, hi.  Thanks so much for taking our questions.  So , you know, as you know, the pandemic has really disproportionately impacted small and medium -sized businesses.  And the Fed  launched a few efforts this year to\u2014through its 13( 3) prog rams to reach out to those companies.  But, you know, considering that some of those programs are ending, is there anything else that the Fed\u2019s actions can do to provide support to those companies?  Or is that solely Congress \u2019s domain?  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: I think the main thing that those companies need is a \u2014is a robust recovery\u2014a strong, robust recovery.  And so we , we contribute to that through highly accommodative monetary policy, through accommodative financial conditions that are supporting economic activit y.  Health authorities are contributing to that through, through, you know, management of the spread of the virus and now through vaccines and the delivery of those vaccines.  And Congress contributes , contributes  to that by helping them make it through this very difficult time.  And , and I think my understanding is that there \u2019s support for small businesses in , in what \u2019s being discussed on Capitol Hill.  I would certainly think that would be something well worth looking at.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Paul  La Monica. PAUL LA MONICA.   Hi, Chair Powell\u2014hi, Chair Powell .  I was wondering if you\u2019 ve had any conversations yet with any members of the incoming Biden A dministration, particularly Janet Yellen, who obviously you can share some similar experience in running the Fed .  So just curious to get your thoughts on how the relationship with Treasury and the new A dministration might differ than the past couple of years.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, you know, we \u2019ve had a \u2014and I \u2019ve had sort of the typical meetings with the transition team for Treasury.  They \u2019ve met with quite a lot of people in our agency and other agencies.  And , really, it\u2019 s about learning what we do.  And I , I really have only spoken to f ormer Chair Yellen to congratulate her on being nominated a nd just to say that I look forward to working with her.  You know, I did work very closely with her for five years before she left and have stayed in touch, you know.  So I did that.  But I have not discussed, you know, policy with her.  And I , I\u2019m  not going to do that until she \u2019s confirmed.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Yes.   Chair, thank you for taking the question.  You \u2019ve been asked this question before in various forms.  I \u2019m going to try it a little bit differently now.  The equity market and the bond market seem to be telling two different stories about where , where  things are heading.   We [ inaudible]  on the stock market , bond yields remain very low.  Does that concern you at all?  A re, are you getting any more concerned about asset  valuations in, in light of the highly accommodative Fed  policies?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You, you were breaking up, but I , I think I got that.   I think I got it.  So, you know, financial stability\u2014we , we look at a broad range of things.  We actually have a framew ork so that we can, you know, be \u2014evaluate changes in financial stability over time, and so that the public can evaluate whether we\u2019 re doing a job\u2014a good job at it.  We \u2014so what do we look at?  Asset prices is one thing that we look at.  And , you know, we published a report a few weeks ago on that \u2014maybe it was month or so ago.  A nyway.  And I think you\u2019 ll find a mixed bag there.  It depends \u2014with equities, it depends on whether you\u2019 re looking at P /Es or whether you\u2019re looking at the premium ove r risk -free\u2014over the risk -free return.  If you look at P /Es, they \u2019re historically high, but , you know, in a world where the \u2014where the  risk-free rate is sustain \u2014is going to be low for a sustained period, the equity premium, which is really the reward you get  for taking equity risk, would be what you\u2019 d look at.  And that\u2019s not at , at incredibly low levels, w hich would mean that they\u2019 re not overpriced in that sense.  Admittedly, P /Es are high, but that \u2019s\u2014you know , that \u2019s, that\u2019s  maybe not as relevant in a world  where we think the 10- year Treasury is going to be lower than it \u2019s been historically, from a\u2014from a  return perspective.  You know, we look at \u2014we also look at borrowing\u2014leverage of financial institutions.   We spent 10 years and the banks spent 10 years buil ding up their capital.  So far, they\u2019 ve been a   source of strength through this crisis, and their capital has held up well.  We look at leverage in the nonfinancial sector \u2014that\u2019s households and nonfinancial corporates.  Nonfinancial corporate leverage is high.  We \u2019ve been watching that.  But , you know, rates are really low.  So \u2014and so companies have been able to handle their debt loads even in weak periods, because rates are\u2014rates are quite low.  Your interest payments are low.  Defaults and downgrades  have , have  declined since earlier in the year.  Households came into this very strong, and there certainly has been a hit there for people who are unemployed.  But, you know, with the CARES Act, Congress replaced a lot of lost income.  You know, it \u2019s very  important that , that  the economy gets strong again.  I mean, the , the ultimate thing to support financial stability is a strong economy. The last thing is , is really funding markets.  W e found that there was a lot of unstable funding for companies, partic ularly financial companies.  And that \u2019s, that\u2019s  down to a \u2014to a very low level these days.  So the broad financial stability picture is , is kind of mixed, I would say.  I would say, you know, asset prices are , are a little high in that metric and in my view .  But , overall, you have a mixed picture.  You , you don\u2019 t have, you know, a lot of red flags on that.  So\u2014and it\u2019s \u2014again, it \u2019s something that we monitor essentially ongoing, almost daily.  You know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  monitoring these prices for that and , and have published our , our framework, and, you know, we \u2019ll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed.  So we work very hard at it \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions about the fiscal support for the economy.  This year \u2019s budget deficit is $3.1 trillion.  And Republicans have argued they don\u2019 t want to spend more, because we can \u2019t afford it.  So I \u2019m wondering if you can   make the case for how mu ch we can afford.  At what point do deficits and the debt start to have an impact on the economy or on interest rates?  And how would we know when we get there?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So people who\u2014people who run for elected office and win, they\u2019 re the ones \u2014their reward is they get to make those very difficult de cisions.  And\u2014you know, so we\u2019re not charged with providing fiscal advice to, to Congress.  But I , I would just say, as a  general \u2014as a general rule, it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path.  F or my way of thinking and many others \u2019, the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low and taxes are \u2014you know, are , are pouring in, and there \u2019s, there\u2019s room to get on\u2014get on a sustainable path, because the economy \u2019s really doing well.  You \u2019re still now in the\u2014in the , you know, some part of , of an  economic crisis.  And the fact that Congress is debating a fairly large bill today suggests that, that\u2014you know, suggests that something fairly substantial is going to get done, we hope \u2014that what \u2019s being discussed is, you know, is , is of some size.  In terms of what is a sustainable level, I think, you know, it\u2019s \u2014the question is \u2014we \u2019ve always looked at debt to GDP, and we \u2019re very high by that measure.  By some other measures, we\u2019re actually not that high.  In particular, you can look at the real interest rate payments, the amount of , what does it cost?  And from that standpoint, if you\u2014if you sort of take real interest costs of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we \u2019re actually \u2014you know , we\u2019re actually on a more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes.  Again, these are \u2014these are issues for Congress.   But , you know, I \u2019ll just say in the near term, I think fiscal \u2014the case for , for fiscal is, is  strong.  And I \u2019m certainly hoping\u2014I think it will be very good for the economy if , if we did get something soon. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Well, the  argument for continuing to spend is that low interest rates make it affordable.   Do you worry you get  in a situation where you would have congressional interference in monetary policymaking or at least feel significant political pressure to keep rates low because the country can \u2019t afford to pay a significant interest bill?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yeah, I mean, that \u2019s\u2014I think we \u2019re a ve ry, very long way from that.  You know, the , the Congress has given the Fed  independence on the condition that we stick to our knitting.  We try very hard to do that.  And I , I think that \u2019s, that\u2019s  what people call fiscal dominance.  And I , I think we \u2019re just a very, very long way from that.  I think, you know, if we\u2014if we  do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment and stable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don \u2019t think that that is something that will\u2014that I would worry about, certainly not in the near term.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you very much.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thank you\n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 10, "dovish": 42, "neutral": 24}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 0, "dovish": 3, "neutral": 20}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 10, "dovish": 45, "neutral": 44}, "speech_summary": "The Federal Reserve remains committed to achieving maximum employment and price stability, taking forceful actions to provide relief and stability during the pandemic. While economic activity has rebounded, the pace of improvement has slowed, with strong household spending on goods but low spending on services, particularly in sectors that require close gathering.The rebound in household spending is partially due to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which have provided crucial support. The housing sector has fully recovered, supported by low mortgage interest rates, and business investment has also picked up. Despite the progress, overall economic activity remains below pre-pandemic levels, and the path ahead remains uncertain. While more than half of the jobs lost in March and April have been regained, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed, with job growth in November at 245,000 and the unemployment rate remaining elevated at 6.7 percent. Participation in the labor market is still notably below pre-pandemic levels, and although there has been progress, the focus remains on the millions of Americans who are still unemployed.FOMC participants expect the unemployment rate to decrease, reaching 5 percent by the end of next year and dropping below 4 percent by 2023. However, the economic downturn has disproportionately affected lower-wage workers, particularly African Americans and Hispanics, and has created uncertainty about the future. Additionally, inflation remains below the 2 percent objective, but is projected to gradually increase over the next few years. The outlook for the economy remains highly uncertain and is dependent on the course of the virus.Recent news on vaccines has been positive, but there are still significant challenges and uncertainties regarding their timing, production, distribution, and efficacy. The ongoing surge in COVID-19 cases is concerning, and a full economic recovery is unlikely until people feel confident to engage in various activities.The FOMC notes that fewer participants see downside risks to the economic outlook, but risks for inflation remain weighted to the downside. The Fed's response to the crisis is guided by their mandate to promote employment and stable prices, and they will maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these goals are achieved.The Federal Reserve's enhanced balance sheet guidance, combined with their forward guidance for the federal funds rate, will ensure that monetary policy remains accommodative as the recovery progresses. Their guidance is outcome-based and tied to progress towards employment and inflation goals, with the intention to increase policy accommodation if progress slows. The Fed's interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy, and they have been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit for households, businesses, and governments. These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have been deployed to an unprecedented extent with the support of Congress and the Treasury. While funds from the CARES Act will not be available after December 31, the Treasury could authorize support for emerging lending facilities if needed.After the crisis, the emergency tools will be put away, as they are lending powers and not spending powers. While many borrowers and the overall economy benefit from these programs, direct fiscal support may be necessary for those who cannot repay loans, as elected officials have the power to make decisions about where collective resources should be directed.The FOMC acknowledges that it will take time and ongoing support from both monetary and fiscal policy to restore economic activity and employment levels. They emphasize their commitment to using all available tools to support the economy and ensure a strong recovery, recognizing the impact of their actions on communities, families, and businesses.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Would the current economic indicators constitute \"substantial further progress\" towards the Committee's goals?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman states that they are not associating specific numbers with the test at this point. The overall message is that monetary policy will remain accommodative until maximum employment and price stability goals are achieved. \"Substantial further progress\" means employment and inflation getting closer to their goals before adjustments to asset purchases are made.", "'QUESTION': Why not increase the duration of asset purchases given the challenging period ahead?\n'ANSWER': We have already provided guidance on the path of asset purchases and have adopted a flexible average inflation-targeting framework. We believe our current policy stance is appropriate and providing support to the economy. We have the flexibility to provide more accommodation if needed and will use our tools to support the economy until our goals are achieved.", "'QUESTION': What would prompt the Fed to shift Treasury purchases towards the longer end of the curve and does the guidance on asset purchases rule out lengthening maturities while tapering monthly purchases?\n'ANSWER': The Fed considers overall policy stance, financial conditions, and the state of the economy at each meeting to determine if a policy shift is needed. They believe current financial conditions are appropriate, but are prepared to provide stronger accommodation if necessary. The idea of maintaining duration while reducing quantity, like the Bank of Canada, was discussed but views on it were mixed and it is not a high possibility.", "'QUESTION': Will the Federal Reserve accept the legal interpretation of a new Treasury Secretary for the 13(3) facilities, and are there plans for future facilities without Treasury backing?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve has not considered the possibility of a new Treasury Secretary's legal interpretation for the 13(3) facilities. While they have the ability to create facilities without Treasury backing, they still require approval from the Treasury Secretary. Some facilities in the past did not have Treasury backing.", "'QUESTION': Do you have any plans to do more facilities without Treasury backing?\n'ANSWER': We have the authorities and will use them if needed and if the law permits. We are focused on getting through year-end and not planning or discussing future actions.", "'QUESTION': Is the proposed $900 billion fiscal stimulus program sufficient and what is the concern regarding the recent surge in cases?\n'ANSWER': The case for fiscal policy is strong and widely understood, but the details are up to Congress. The surge in cases is expected to have a significant effect on suppressing activity, particularly in sectors like bars, restaurants, and travel. The first quarter will show significant effects, but with vaccinations, the economy should perform strongly in the second half of next year. The next few months are crucial and will require help.", "'QUESTION': Are you worried about valuation pressures in the housing market and what can the Fed do to contain them?\n'ANSWER': Housing prices are not a financial stability concern at the moment. There is high demand and builders are expected to bring forth supply. Some of the demand may be pent-up from when the economy was closed, so once that demand is met, the real level of demand will be more manageable.", "'QUESTION': Is there more the Fed can do to fight the economic slowdown or is it now Congress's responsibility?\n'ANSWER': The Fed can expand its asset purchase programs and focus on the longer end. However, in the near term, people need support rather than just low interest rates. The government policies need to work together to create a bridge for those who have been severely affected by the pandemic. The Fed will continue to provide support for the economy for a considerable period of time.", "'QUESTION': Do you have an estimate of when the US might reach herd immunity from the vaccine, and how does the lack of movement on bond purchases connect to inflation expectations?\n'ANSWER': We have estimates for when the US might reach herd immunity, but it depends on assumptions like vaccine uptake and rollout speed. It could happen in the middle or second half of next year. Inflation is a concern, but there are disinflationary pressures globally, and it will take time to reach our target. We're committed to keeping policy accommodative until inflation reaches and exceeds 2 percent.", "QUESTION: How have markets responded to the Fed's framework announcement?\n\nANSWER: Markets have found the Fed's framework announcement credible, as evidenced by significant movements in inflation compensation and survey measures of when the Fed will lift off. The reception in markets suggests that the framework is credible and market participants have responded accordingly.", "'QUESTION': How does the Fed view climate change and its potential impact on monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is joining the Network for Greening the Financial System and will carefully consider how climate change affects its work. While climate change is not explicitly assigned to the Fed's mandate, it is relevant to their responsibility of regulating and supervising banks and ensuring financial stability. The Fed will engage with external stakeholders and prioritize supervision of financial institutions and financial stability concerns over monetary policy in relation to climate change.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide detail on the impact of budget deficits and lack of aid to state and local governments on the recovery, and what more can the Fed do to fill that hole?\n'ANSWER': State and local governments provide critical services, and the decision to provide more fiscal support to them is up to Congress. Some states have experienced significant revenue loss, while others have been surprised on the upside. Employment in state and local government has dropped by 1.3 million, a larger number than during the Global Financial Crisis. The Fed is monitoring the situation but fiscal policy decisions are in the hands of Congress.", "QUESTION: Why was now not the moment for a big new easing step and is it because of the medium-term outlook improving or the Fed's capacity to help struggling people?\n\nANSWER: The current asset purchase program is already providing significant support to the economy, particularly for interest-sensitive sectors. The struggling parts of the economy are not affected by high interest rates but by the impact of COVID-19. The Fed has the ability to buy more bonds or longer-term bonds if necessary, but the focus should be on fiscal policy. The Fed remains open to increasing asset purchases or adjusting maturities, but believes the current stance is appropriate.", "'QUESTION': How might the potential release of pent-up demand for travel and entertainment affect inflation, and would it be a transient problem or something that requires closer scrutiny?\n'ANSWER': The increase in prices due to pent-up demand would likely be transient and not result in ongoing price-level increases. The inflation dynamics of the 1970s, where persistent price increases occurred, are no longer in place. The connection between low unemployment and inflation is weaker, and the persistence of temporary shocks into inflation over time is not present.", "'QUESTION': So not the kind of thing that the Fed would be trigger-happy to?\n'ANSWER': No.", "'QUESTION': Can you confirm if there is any truth to the rumors that the Federal Reserve plans to increase interest rates?\n'ANSWER': No, there is absolutely no truth to those rumors.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the Treasury market can operate smoothly without the active presence of the Fed buying Treasury debt?\n'ANSWER': It is not a foregone conclusion that there needs to be a permanent Fed presence in the Treasury market. The Fed is currently buying assets to support the economy, but we need to ensure the capacity for handling Treasury paper by the private sector. There is ongoing work to explore this, including the potential for central clearing to reduce risk.", "'QUESTION': Is there anything else the Fed can do to support small and medium-sized businesses impacted by the pandemic, or is that solely Congress's responsibility?\n'ANSWER': The main thing small and medium-sized businesses need is a strong recovery, which the Fed supports through accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions. Health authorities contribute through virus management and vaccines. Congress helps by providing assistance during this difficult time, and there is support for small businesses in discussions on Capitol Hill.", "'QUESTION': Have you had any conversations with members of the incoming Biden Administration, particularly Janet Yellen, and how do you think the relationship with Treasury and the new Administration might differ?\n'ANSWER': We have had meetings with the transition team for Treasury, but I have only spoken to former Chair Yellen to congratulate her and express my willingness to work with her. I have not discussed policy with her and will wait until she is confirmed before doing so.", "QUESTION: Are you concerned about the disparity between the equity market and the bond market, and the potential impact on asset valuations due to the Fed's accommodative policies?\n\nANSWER: Financial stability is evaluated through various factors, including asset prices. While P/Es are historically high, the equity premium is not at incredibly low levels, indicating they are not overpriced considering the low risk-free rate. Nonfinancial corporate leverage is high, but low interest rates have helped companies handle their debt. Overall, the financial stability picture is mixed, with ongoing monitoring and accountability.", "'QUESTION': Can you make the case for how much we can afford in terms of deficits and debt, and at what point do they start to impact the economy or interest rates?\n'ANSWER': It is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path, especially when the economy is strong and unemployment is low. Debt to GDP is high, but looking at real interest rate payments, we are on a more sustainable path. In the near term, fiscal support is strong and getting something soon would be good for the economy.", "'QUESTION': Do you worry about congressional interference or political pressure to keep interest rates low due to the country's inability to afford high interest payments?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell believes that the Federal Reserve is far from facing such a situation. The Fed has been granted independence by Congress as long as they focus on their responsibilities. As long as the Fed fulfills its mandate of supporting the economy, achieving maximum employment, maintaining stable prices, and ensuring financial stability, Chair Powell does not anticipate any concerns about fiscal dominance in the near future.", "'QUESTION': (No question provided)\n'ANSWER': The reporter thanks Chair Powell for his time and participation in the discussion."]}
