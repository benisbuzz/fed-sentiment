The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded a two -day meeting earlier today.  As you already know from our statement, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to \u00bc percent and to make no ch ange in either its asset purchase program or its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target.  I will discuss the rationales for our decision in a moment. Economic growth has generally been proceeding at a moderate pace,  with continued\u2014albeit  somewhat uneven \u2014improvement in labor market conditions.  Of course, to say that the job market has improved does not imply that current conditions are satisfactory .  Notably, at 7.3 percent, the unemployment rate remains well above acceptable levels.   Long -term unemployment and underemployment remain high.  And we have seen ongoing declines in labor force participation, which likely  reflects discouragement on the part of many potential workers as well as longer -term influences , such as the aging of the population.   In the Committee\u2019s assessment,  the downside risks to growth have diminished , on net, over the past year, reflecting, among other factors, somewhat better economic and financial conditions in Europe and increased confidence on the part of househol ds and firms  in the staying power of the U.S. recovery .  However, the tightening of financial conditions  observed in recent months , if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and the labor market.  In addition, federal fiscal policy continues to be an important restraint on growth and a source of downside risk. Apart from  some fluctuations due primarily to changes in oil prices, inflation has continued to run below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer -term objective .  The Committee recogniz es that inflation persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic  7 performance, and we will continue to monitor inflation developments closely.   However, the unwinding of some transitory factors has led to mode rately  higher inflation recently, as expected .  And, with longer -term inflation expectations well anchored , the Committee anticipates that inflation will gradua lly move back toward 2 percent. In conjunction with this meeting, the 17 participants in our policy discussions \u20145 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents \u2014submitted individual economic projections.  As always, each participant\u2019s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.  Also, at this meeting, we extended t he horizon of our projections through 2016.   Generally, the projections of individual participants s how that they continue to expect moderate economic growth, picking up over time, as well as gradual progress towards  levels of unemployment and inflation, consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.  More specifically , participants\u2019 projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.0 to 2.3 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.1 percen t in 2014 and 2.5 to 3.3 percent in 2016.  For the unemployment rate, t he central tendency of projections for the fourth quarter of each year is 7.1 to 7.3 percent for 2013, declining to 6.4 to 6.8 percent in 2014 and, by 2016, to 5.4 to 5.9 percent \u2014about the longer -run normal level for the unemployment rate.   Most participants see inflation gradually increasing from its current low level toward the Committee\u2019s longer -run objective of 2 percent .  The central tendency of their projections for inflation is 1.1 to 1.2 percent for this year, 1.3 to 1.8 percent for 2014, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016.   With unemployment still elevated and inflation projected to run below the Committee\u2019s longer -run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies.  As you  7 know, in normal times , the Committee eases monetary policy by lowering its target for the short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate.  However, the target range for the federal funds rate, currently at 0 to \u00bc percent, cannot be lowered meaningfully further.  Accordingly, the Committee has been  providing policy support to the economy through two complementary  methods:  by purchasing and holding Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities and by communicating  the C ommittee\u2019s  plans for setting the federal funds rate target over the medium term.  I\u2019ll discuss these tools in turn, beginning with our program of asset purchases.  In September 2012, the FOMC initiated a program of purchasing $40 billion per month in agency  mortgage -backed securities, in addition to the $45 billion per month in longer -term Treasury securities that we were already acquiri ng as part of our m aturity extension program.  We stated that , subject to our ongoing assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program,  purchases would continue until we saw a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.  In December  2012, we announced that we would continue to purchase $45 billion per month in longer -term Tre asuries  after the m aturity e xtension program ended later that month.  Thus, our total purchases of longer -term securities were maintained at $85 billion per month, in addition to the reinvestment or rolling over of maturing securities on our balance sheet.   The Committee agreed today to contin ue asset purchases at that rate, subject to the same conditions that we laid out a year ago.  Because the Committee tied its asset purchases to the outlook for the labor market, it\u2019 s important to assess how that outlook has evolved.  As I noted earlier, conditions in the job market today  are still far from what all of us would like to see.   Nevertheless, meaningful progress has been made in the year since we announced the asset purcha se program.  For example, the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.1 percent at the time of our announcement to  7 7.3 percent today, and about 2.3 million private -sector jobs have been created over the same period.  Over the past 12 months, aggregate hours of  work are up by about 2.4 percent, weekly new claims for unemployment insurance have  fallen by about 50,000, and surveys suggest that households perceive jobs as more readily available.  Importantly, these gains were achieved despite substantial fisc al headwinds, which are likely slowing  economic growth this year by a percentage point , or more , and reducing employment by hundreds of thousands of jobs .  Not all labor market developments  over the past year  were positive, however; notably, the labor force participation rate fell by about 0.3 percentage points  and real wages remained about flat.  In light of this cumulative progress,  the FOMC concluded at our June meeting that the criterion of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market  might well be met over the subsequent year  or so .  Accordingly, the Committee sought to provide more guidance on how the pace of purchases  might  be adjusted over time.  T he Committee anticipated in June that, subject to certain conditions, it might be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of purchase s later this year , continuing to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, and ending purchases around midyear 2014.  However, we also made clear at that time that adjustments  to the pace of purchases would depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook\u2014in particular, on the receipt of evidence supporting the Committee\u2019s expectation that gains in the labor market will be sustained and that inflation is moving back towards  its 2 percent objective over time.

But in evaluating whether a modest reduction in the pace of  7 asset purchases would be appropriate at this meeting, however, the Committee concluded that the economic data do not yet provide sufficient confirmation of its baseline outlook to warrant such a reduction.  Moreover, the Committee has some concern that the rapid tightening of financial conditions in recent months could have the effect of slowing growth, as I noted earlier, a concern that would be exacerbated if conditions tightened further.  Finally, the extent of the effects of restrictive fiscal policies remain  unclear, and upcoming fiscal debates may involve additional risks to financial markets and to the broader economy.  In light of these uncertainties , the Committee decided to await more evidence that the recovery\u2019s progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of asset purchases.   The Committee will, of course, continue to monitor economic and financ ial developments closely.  As noted in today\u2019s statement, i n judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee\u2019s expectation of ongoing i mprovement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back towards  its longer -run objective.  However, as  we have said , and  as today\u2019s decision underscores, asset purchases are not on a preset course .  The Committee\u2019s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the economic outlook and on the Committee\u2019s ongoing assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of the program.  Let me turn now to the FOMC\u2019s forward guidance regarding the federal funds r ate.  The Committee again reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 \u00bd percent, so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well  behaved as described in our  statement .  As I have noted frequently, the economic conditions we have set out as preceding any future rate increase are thresholds, not triggers.  For example, a decline in the unemployment rate to  7 6\u00bd percent would not le ad automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but would, instead , indicate only that it had become appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase.  The Committee would be unlike ly to increase rates  if inflation were projected to remain below our 2 percent objective for some time, for example ; and, in making its assessment, the Committee would also take into account additional measures of labor market conditions, such as job gains .  Thus, the first increases in short -term rates might not occur until the unemployment rate is considerably below 6\u00bd percent.  The projections of the path of the federal funds rate by individual Committee participants are generally consistent with this guidance.  Although the central tendency of the projected unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of next year encompasses 6 \u00bd percent, 12 of the 17 participants expect the first rate increase to take place in 2015 and two expect it to occur in 2016.   Most p articipants also see the funds rate target rising only very slowly after the process of  removing policy accommodation begins.  The median projected funds rate for the end of 2015 is 1 percent.  And notably, although the central tendencies of the projections for both inflation and the unemployment rate in 2016 are close to the longer -run normal values  for those variables , the median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of  2016 is  2 percent , well below the longer -run normal value for the federal f unds rate  of 4 percent or so projected by most participants .  Committee participants generally believe that, because the headwinds to recovery will abate only gradually, achieving and maintaining maximum employment and price stability will require a patien t policy approach that involves keeping the target for the federal funds rate below its longer -run normal value for some time.   7 Let me close by noting that although the FOMC is employing two instruments of policy \u2014asset purchases and forward guidance about s hort-term interest rates \u2014the overall stance of monetary policy is what matters for growth, jobs, and inflation.  Our program of asset purchases was set up a year ago to help achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the conte xt of price stability, relative to conditions when the program was initiated, and we have made progress toward meeting that criterion.  However, even after asset purchases are wound down\u2014which we will do in a manner that is both deliberate and dependent on the incoming economic data \u2014the Federal Reserve\u2019s rates guidance and its ongoing holdings of securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with an aggressive pursuit of our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  Thank you, and I\u2019d be glad to take your questions. PEDRO DA COSTA.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  Pedro da Costa from Reuters .  You cite meaningful progress on the labor market both on the unemployment front and in terms of payroll growth .  But  much of the decline in the unemployment rate has been due , as you know , to the decline in participation .  So my question to you is \u2014and also on the payroll front, some people would argue that, while  there has been growth, it hasn \u2019t been strong enough to ke ep up with population growth and make  up the gap that we have from the recession .  So, how high do you think the jobless rate would be if it were not for the decline in participation ?  I\u2019ve heard estimates as high as 10 to 11 percent .  And could you put th e labor market in that context\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Certainly .  So, I think there is a cyclical component to participation , and , in that respect, the unemployment rate understates the amount of sort of true unemployment , if you will , in the economy .  But o n the other hand, there is also a downward trend in participation in our economy , which is arising from factors that have been going on for  7 some time , including an aging population, lower participation by prim e-age males, fewer women in the labor force \u2014other factors which aren \u2019t really related to this recession .   Over the last year, the unemployment rate has dropped by eight -tenths  of a percentage point .  The participation rate has  dropped by three -tenths  of a percentage point, which is pretty close to the  trend .  So, in other words, I think it would be fair to s ay that most of the improvement in  the unemployment rate \u2014not all, but most of it in the last year \u2014is due to job creation rather than lower participation .  I would also note that if you look at the broader measures of unemployment that the BLS publishes , including part -time work, including discouraged workers and so on, you\u2019 ll see that those rates have fallen about the same amount as the overall standard civilian unemployment rate .  So I think that there has been progress , and it \u2019s obscure d to some extent by the downward trend in participation.  But I also would agree with you that the unemployment rate, while  perhaps the best single indicator of the state of labor market , is not by itself a fully re presentative indicator\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Binya  App elbaum, the New York Times .  To what extent do you regard yourself as responsible for the tightening in financial conditions that you noted?  Was it a mistake to talk about tapering in the way that you did in June and do you stand by your guidance that it will be appropriate ?  Do you still expect that it will be appropriate to dial down asset purchases by the end of this year?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  So to  answer the first part of your question, I think ther e\u2019s no alternative in making monetary policy but to communicate as clearly as possible , and that \u2019s what we tried to do.  As of June, we had made meaningful progress in labor market conditions , and the C ommittee thought that was the time to begin talking ab out how the eventual wind- down of the program would take place and how it would be tied to the evolution of economic variables .   7 And, in particular, I talked about a proposed strategy that would take about a year for the total wind -down to take place and w hich, in turn, was also fully contingent on the ratification \u2014so to speak \u2014of our outlook, which included continued improvements in the labor market .  So all of that was very consistent with what we said when we began the program , that our goal was to achieve a substantial improvement in  the outlook for the labor market , and we needed to communicate how that was going to be put into practice .  Failing to communica te that information would have  risked creating a large divergence bet ween market expectations, public expectations, and what the C ommittee intentions were , and that could have led to much more serious problems down the road.  So I think the communication was very important .   The general framework \u2014to answer the other part of your question, the general framework in which we \u2019re operating is still the same .  We have a three- part baseline projection , which involves increasing growth that \u2019s picking up over  time as fiscal drag is reduced, continuing gains in the labor market , and inflation moving back towards objective .  We are looking to see \u2014in the coming meetings, we \u2019ll be looking to see if the data confirm that basic outlook.  If it does, we \u2019ll take a first step at some point\u2014possibly later this year \u2014and then continue so long as  the data are consistent with that continued  progress .  And so that basic structure is still in place . But what I want to emphasize is really two things .  First, as I \u2019ve said, asset purchases are not on a preset course, they are conditional on the data .  They\u2019ve always been conditional on the data.  And , secondly, that even as we move from asset purchases to rate policy as the principal tool of monetary policy , it\u2019s our intent to maintain a highly accommodative policy and to provide the support necessary fo r our economy to recover and to provide jobs for our citizens.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jo n Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Just to follow up on Binya\u2019s question, Mr. Chairman, you said that you could pull  back the purchases possibly later this year .  You sound a little bit less certain that it\u2019 s going to happen later this year .  So I \u2019d like you\u2014to ask you to talk a little bit more about your conviction about whether these are like \u2014the pullback is likely to start this year, wh ere do you stand on that ?  And I also don\u2019 t think I heard you mentioned that 7 percent unemployment number that you\u2019 ve talked \u2014you talked about back in June .  That was the rate that was \u2014the unemployment rate that was supposed to prevail when the Fed was done doing this .  Is that no l onger operative?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  So ther e is no fixed calendar \u2014schedule, I really have to emphasize that .  If the data confirm our  basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook and we believe that the three- part test that I mentioned is ind eed coming to pass, then we could move later this year , we could begin later this year .  But even if we do that, the subsequent steps will be dependent on continued progress in the economy .  So we are tied to the data\u2014we don \u2019t have a fixed calendar schedul e\u2014but we do have the same basic framework that I described in June.   The criterion for ending the asset purchases  program is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market .  Last time, I gave 7 percent as an indicative number to give you some sense of, you know, where that might be .  But, as my first answer suggested,  the unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure, in  all circumstances , of the  state of the  labor market overall .  For example, just last month, the decline in  the unemployment rate came about more than entirely because of declining participation, not because of increased jobs .  So what we will be looking at is the overall labor market situation, including the unemployment  7 rate, but including other factors as well .  But , in particular, there is not any magic number that we are shooting for .  We \u2019re looking for overall improvement in the labor market\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Steve Liesman , with CNBC .  Mr. Chairman, one question\u2014just three parts , if you don \u2019t mind .  Have you indicated to President Obama you did not want to serve a third term?  If so, when ?  Or did President Obama i ndicate to you he did not want  you to serve a third term?  A nd those two parts notwithstanding, would you serve a third term if asked,  either wholly or in part ?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Wel l, it\u2019s convenient  because I have the same answer to all three parts of your question.  If you  will indulge me just a little longer, I prefer not to talk about my plans at this point .  I hope to have more infor mation for you at some reasonably soon date, but today I want to focus on monetary policy .  I\u2019d prefer not to talk about  my own plans.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Oh, I \u2019m sorry .  I meant financial conditions, tighter  financial conditions\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Oh, tighter financial conditions, sure .  Well, I think part of the reaction we\u2019 ve seen \u2014and it comes from a number of sources \u2014part of it comes from improved economic news and that\u2019 s part of the reason why rates have gone up in other countries as well as in the United S tates.  And that \u2014to the extent that tighter financial conditions reflect a  7 better outlook, that \u2019s a good thing , and that \u2019s not a problem at all .  Part of it reflects views  about monetary policy , and that we want to make sure we get straight .  And that \u2019s wh y\u2014to answer the earlier question, again, it \u2019s why communication is so important .  We need to explain , as best we can, how we \u2019re going to move and on what bas is we\u2019re going to move .  It\u2019s much more difficult today than it was 20 years ago because the tools are more complex so they \u2019re less familiar, but that\u2019s still very important .   I think the other factor which was at play was an unwinding of excessively risky and levered  positions in the markets , and insufficiencies of liquidity in some cases meant that t hose unwindings led to larger reactions in prices and rates than might otherwise have occurred.  Now, the tightening associated with that is , to some extent , unwelcome, but , on the other hand, to the extent that some of the riskier, more lever ed positions have been eliminated, I think that makes the situation more sustainable and reduces , at least , the risk that there will be an over -strong reaction to further announcements .   So we will do our best to communicate clearly .  That is our goal and our objective .  The more clearly we communicate, the better the chance that markets will understand our intentions and that we can avoid any sharp movements .  But , again, we \u2019re dealing with tools that are less familiar , harder to quantify, and harder to com municate about than the traditional funds rate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Robin Harding , from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, the median C ommittee member expect s a 2 percent interest rate at the end of 2016 , and , in the long run, they expect interest rates to return to 4 percent .  Can you give us any sense of when you and when the C ommittee expect interest rates to get back to that 4 percent figure \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Let me first restate  the\u2014I think the key point here , which is that the large majority of the pa rticipants  of the FOMC , including voting and nonvoting members   7 who a re asked to describe their own assessment of optimal policy \u2014the large majority of them estimate that the appropriate target for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 will be around 2 percent , even though at that time the economy should be close to full employment , according to our best projections .  The reason for that \u2014there may  be possibly several reasons, but we did discuss this in the C ommittee today \u2014the primary reason for that low value is that we expect that a number of factors \u2014including the slow recovery of the housing sector , continued fiscal drag, perhaps continued effects from the f inancial crisis \u2014may still prove  to be headwinds to the recovery .  And even though we can achieve full employment, doing so will be done by using rates lower than , sort of , the long -run normal .  So, in other words, in economics terms, the equilibrium rate, the rate that achieves full employment, looks like it will be lower for a time because of these h eadwinds that will be slowing aggregate demand growth .   So that \u2019s why we expect to see growth that \u2014I mean , rates at an unusually low level .  I imagine  it would take a few more years after that to get to the 4 percent level .  I couldn\u2019 t be much more precis e than that \u2014I mean , we\u2019re already obviously stretching the bounds of credibility to talk about specific projections to 2016.  But I think you would expect to see that  rates would gradually rise for the two or three years after 2016 and ultimately get to 4 percent.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, Josh Zumbrun from Bloomberg News .  You indicated that you can see the F ed lowering the pace of purchases once the economy starts to grow faster, in line with what the F ed\u2019s projected .  For about the past four years, the F ed has been projecting that growth would quicken to about 3 percent , and it never has .  So, at what point are you decide \u2014going to decide that other c osts and benefits are the reason that you \u2019re making the decision ?  Are we getting close to that having  to be a deciding factor even if you don\u2019 t get the growth forecast , the way you have n\u2019t the past four years ?  And does the complication of this \u2014 7 this is kind of a second question, but I\u2019m going to do it  anyway\u2014does the complication of this mean that you nee d a press conference to make a tapering decision?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, you\u2019 re certainly right that we have been over -optimistic about out -year growth .  There are a number of reasons for that .  One reason for  it, though, is that it appears \u2014and I talked  about this in a  speech last year \u2014it appears that , as part of the aftermath of the financial crisis , that , at least temporarily, the potential growth rate of the economy has been slowed, perhaps because new businesses are not being formed at  the same rate, innovation may not be translated into new technologies at the same rate, investment is slower, et cetera.  So it appears , again , that the potential rate of growth of the economy has been slowed somewhat , at least temporarily , by the recessi on and  the financial crisis , and you can see that in the slower productivity figures .   Now, we have \u2014you know, we haven\u2019 t anticipated that slowdown in productivity , and that\u2019s one of the main reasons why we haven \u2019t anticipated the relatively slow growth .  Now, it \u2019s important to recognize though that what monetary policy affects is not the potential rate of growth, long -run rate of growth, but rather the cyclical part, the deviation of output and employment from its normal level.  And in predicting the amount of slack in the economy , so to speak, we \u2019ve done a little better .  Our predictions of unemployment , for example, ha ve been better than our predictions of growth.  A nd, in particular, one thing that \u2019s been quite striking is that unemployment \u2014we were too p essimistic on unemployment for this year .  Unemployment has fallen faster than we anticipated .  So, in that respect, we were too pessimistic rather than too optimistic .  So, we \u2019ll continue to do the best we can.  We \u2019re looking , again , to see confirmation of our broader scenario , which basically is that we \u2019ll continue to see progress in the labor market ,   7 that growth will be sufficient to support that progress , and th at inflation will be moving back towards target , and that \u2019s what wi ll determine our policy decisions .   In terms of press conferences, I think it \u2019s important to say that there \u2019s an understanding in the C ommittee that we \u2019ve had for a while , that there are eight \u201c real\u201d meetings every year \u2014that every meeting is a meeting in which any policy decisio n can be taken .

You mentioned fiscal issues in the statement today .  Are you concerned about a government shutdown?  We\u2019re hearing more about that possibility .  Did tha t come up in your discussions at this meeting ?  W hat do you think w ould be the impact of a government shutdown on the economy , and what could the F ed\u2019s\u2014or, would the F ed be prepared to respond to that and help the economy  with additional accommodation , for example, additional asset purchases ?  Thank you.   \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, a fact or that  did concern us in our discussion was some upcoming fiscal policy decisions .  I would include both the possibility of a government shutdown, but also the debt limit is sue.  These are obviously, you know, part of a very complicated set of legislative decisions, strategies, battles, et cetera, which I won \u2019t get into .  But it is the case , I think, that a government shutdown \u2014and perhaps , even more so , a failure  to raise the debt limit\u2014could have very serious consequences for the financial markets and for the economy , and the Federal Reserve\u2019 s policy is to do whatever we can to keep the economy on course .  And so, if these actions led the economy to slow, then we  would have to take that into account , surely .  So this is one of the risks that we are looking at as we think about policy .  That being said, you know, again, our ability to offset these shocks is very limited, particularly a debt  limit shock.  And I think it \u2019s extraordinarily important that Congress and the A dministration work together to find a way to make sure that the government is funded, public services are provided, that the government pays its bills , and that we avoid any kind of event like 2011, which had, at least for a time, a noticeable adverse effect on confidence and on the economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Annalyn Kurtz , with CNNMoney .  This week marks five years since the financial crisis began , and Hank Paulson, who you \u2019ve worked very closely with, has said his biggest regret was that he wasn\u2019 t able to convince the Ame rican people that what was done \u2014 the bank bailouts \u2014weren \u2019t for Wall Street, they were for Main Street .  What is your biggest regret as you reflect on the five -year anniversar y?  And do you believe that the F ed, Congress , and the P resident  have put the necessary measures in place to prevent another deep financial crisis?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, on regrets, as Frank Sinatra  says, I have many .  I think my \u2014you know, reasonably , the biggest  regret I have is that we didn \u2019t forestall the crisis .  I  7 think once the crisis got going, it was extremely hard to prevent .  You know, I think we did what we could, given the powers that we had, and I would agree with Hank that we were motivated entirely by the interest of the broader public , that our goal was to stabilize the financial system so that it would not bring the economy down, so that it would not create massive unemployment and economic hardship that was even more \u2014that would have been even more  severe by many times than what we actually saw .  So I agree with him on that .  And I guess, since you gave me the opportunity, I would mention that, of course, all the money that was used in those operations has been paid back with int erest .  And so, it hasn \u2019t been costly , even from a fiscal point of view .   Now, in terms of progress, that \u2019s a good question.  I think we \u2019ve made a lot of progress .  We had, of course, the Dodd\u2013Frank l aw passed in 2010, and then we recently, you know, have come to agreement i nternationally on a number of measures , including Basel III and other agreements relating to the shadow banking system and other aspects of the financial system .  I think that our \u2014today, our large financial firms, for example, are better capitalized by far  than they were certainly during the crisis and even before the crisis .  Supervision is tougher .  We do stress testing to make sure that firms can withstand not only normal shocks , but very, very large shocks , similar to those they experienced in 2008.  An d, very importantly, of course, we now have a to ol that we didn\u2019 t have in 2008\u2014which would have made , I think, a signific ant difference if we had had it \u2014which is the orderly l iquidation a uthority that the Dodd\u2013Frank bill gave to the FDIC in collaboration with the F ed.  Under the orderly l iquidation a uthority, the FDIC , with other agencies , has the ability to wind down a failing financial firm in a way that minimizes the direct impact on the financial markets and on the economy .   Now, I should say, I don\u2019 t want to overstate the case\u2014 I think there \u2019s a lot more work to be done .  In the case of resolution regimes, for example, the United States has set the course  7 internationally .  Other countries and international bodies like the FSB are setting up standards f or resolution regimes, which are very similar to those of the United States, which is going to make for better cooperation across borders .  But we \u2019re still some distance from being fully geared up to work with foreign counterparts to successfully wind down an international\u2014multinational financial firm.  And that \u2019s\u2014we \u2019ve made progress in that direction , but we need to do more , I think.  So, I think there \u2019s more to be done .  There \u2019s more to be done on derivatives, although a lot has been done to make them mor e transparent and to make the trading of derivatives  safer .  But it\u2019 s going to be probably some  time before, you know, all of this stuff that has been undertaken, all of these measures are fully implemented .  And we can assess, you know, the ultimate impac t on the financial system.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Steve Beckner of MNI , Mr. Chairman .  A number of economists , and, indeed, some of your F ed colleagues , have argued that the effectiveness of quantitative easing has greatly diminished , if not disappeared, and they  point to the rec ent performance of the economy a s proof of that .  And there have been a number of people who have argued that there are regulatory and other impediments to growth beyond the reach of monetary policy .  To what extent are these valid arguments ?  And if the economy does not speed up, if it does not reach your objectives, how will you ever get out of quantitative easing?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, on the effectiveness of our asset purchases, it \u2019s difficult to get a precise measure .  There \u2019s a large academic literature on this subject,  and they have a range of results, s ome suggesting that this is a quite powerful tool, some that it\u2019 s less powerful .  My own assessment is that it has been effective.  If you look at the recovery, you see that some of the strongest sectors, the leading sectors like housing and autos, have been interest-sensitive sectors .  And that these policies have been successful in strengthening financial  7 conditions, lowering interest rates, and thereby promoting recovery .  So I do think that they have been effective.  You mentioned that there hasn\u2019 t been any progress .  There has been a lot of progress .  As I said at the beginning , labor market indicators, while still not where we \u2019d like them to be , are much better today than they were when we began this latest program a year ago .  And, importantly \u2014as actually is referenced in our FOMC statement \u2014that happened notwithstanding a set of fiscal policies which the CBO said would cost between 1 and 1\u00bd percentage points of real grow th and hundreds of thousands of jobs .  So the fact that we have maintained improvements in the labor market that are as good or better than the previous year, notwithstanding this fiscal drag , is some indication that there is at least a partial offset from monetary policy .   Now, just as you say, there are a lot of things in the economy that monetary policy can\u2019t  address .  They include the effectiveness of regulation, they include fiscal policy, they include developments in the private sector .  We do what we can do and what \u2014if we can get help, we \u2019re delighted to have help from other policymakers and from the private sector and we hope that that will happen.  The criterion for ending asset purchases is not, you know, some very high rate of growth .  What it is is the criterion \u2014let me just remind you, the criterion is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market , and we have made significant improvement .  Ultimately, we will reach that level of substantial improvement, and at that point, we wil l be able to wind down the asset purchases .  Again, you know, and I think people don\u2019 t fully appreciate that we have two tools :  We have asset purchases , and we have rate policy and guidance about rates .  It\u2019s our view that the latter, the rate policy , is actually the stronger, more reliable tool .  And when we get to the point where we can, you know, where we are close enough to full employment that rate policy will be sufficient, I think that we will still be able to provide \u2014even  7 if asset purchases are  reduced \u2014we will still be able to provide a highly accommodative monetary background that will allow the economy to continue to grow and move towards full employment.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Peter Cook of  Bloomberg Television, Mr. Chairman .  One of my colleagues was remarking as we came in here, we don\u2019 t often get surprises from the Federal Reserve.  This was a surprise, you talked about \u2014you hadn\u2019 t telegraphed anything specifically, but you\u2019 ve seen the market reaction , I\u2019m sure .  My question for you is , were you intending a surprise today , and did you get the intended result , judging from the market reaction ?  And related to that, by taking this action  today \u2014continuing the bond purchases going forward\u2014 at what point do you believe you \u2019re starting to complicate the exit strategy ?  Simply by continuing to keep the F ed\u2019s foot on the gas pedal, do you make life more complicated for the Federal Reserve down the road?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, it\u2019 s our intention to try to set policy as appropriate for the econom y, as I said earlier .  We are somewhat concerned .  I won \u2019t overstate it, but we do want to see the effects of higher interest rates on the economy , particularly in mortgage rates , on housing .  So to the extent that our policy makes conditions \u2014our policy de cision today makes conditions just a little bit easier, that\u2019 s desirable.  We want to make sure that the economy has adequate support and, in particular, it\u2019s less surprising the market or easing polic y as it is avoiding a tightening until we can be comfor table that the economy is in fact growing, you know, the way we want it to be growing .  So this was a step \u2014it was a step , a precautionary step if you will.  It was a \u2014the intention is to wait a bit longer and to try to get confirming evidence whether to the \u2014to whether or not the economy is , in fact , conforming to this general outlook that we have.  I don\u2019 t think that we are complicating anything for future FOMCs .  It\u2019s true that  7 the assets that we\u2019 ve been buying add to the size of our balance sheet .  But we have developed a variety of tools , and we think we have numerous tools that we \u2014can be used to both manage interest rates and to ultimately unwind the balance sheet when the time comes .  So I, you know, I\u2019m\u2014I feel  quite comfortable that we can \u2014in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the appropriate time , even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period .

There are complex meas urement issues, I would just have to mention that .  There are a lot of issues that are reall y long -term issues as well .  For  example, it might seem a puzzle that the U .S. economy gets richer and richer , and yet there are more poor people .   And the explanation, of course, is that our economy is becoming more unequal .  The more very rich people and more people in the lower half who are not doing well, these are \u2014there\u2019 s a lot of reasons behind this trend, which ha s been going on for decades, and econom ists disagree about the relative importance of things like technology  and international trade  and unionization and other factors that have contributed to that .  But I guess my first point is that these long- run trends \u2014it\u2019s important to address these trends , but the Federal Reserve doesn \u2019t  7 really have the tools to address these long -run distributional trends .  They can only be addressed really by Congress and by the A dministration .  And it \u2019s up to them, I think, to take those steps .  The Federal Reserve is \u2014we are doing our part to help the median family, the median American, because one of our principal goals \u2014we have two principal goals, one i s maximum employment, jobs.  The best way to help families is to create employment opportunities .  We \u2019re still not satisfied, obviously, with where the labor market, the job market is .  We \u2019ll continue to try to provide support for that .  And then the other goal is price stability, low inflation, which, of course, also helps make the economy work better for people in the m iddle and the lower parts of the distribution .   So we use the tools that we have .  It would be better to have a mix of tools at work\u2014not just monetary policy , but fiscal policy and other policies as well .  But the Federal Reserve, we can\u2014you know, we only  have a certain set of tools , and those are the ones that we use .  Again, our objective \u2014our objectives of creating jobs and maintaining price stability, I think, are quite consistent with helping the average American, but there \u2019s limits to what we can do a bout long -run trends , and I think those are very important issue s that Congress and the A dministration, you know, need to look at and decide, you know, what needs to be done there.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Jeremy Tordjman , with AFP .  Some emerging countries are blaming the Fed policies for the financial distress that they are experiencing .  I wanted to have your take on that .  And also, how did you judge the way the markets reacted to your tapering announcement back in June ?  Thank you very much\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  .  Well, let me just talk about\u2014 I talk ed a little bit about the communication in June .  Let me talk just about the emerging markets , which I think is an important issue .  Let me just first say that we have a lot of economists w ho spend all of their time  7 looking at international aspects of monetary policy , and we spend a lot of time looking at emerging markets .  I spend a lot of time talking to my colleagues in emerging markets .  So we \u2019re watching that very carefully .  The Unit ed States is part of a globally integrated economic and financial system , and problems in emerging markets \u2014or in any country , for that matter \u2014can affect the United States as well .  And so, again, we are watching those developments very carefully .   It is tru e that changes in longer -term interest rates in the United States \u2014but also in other advanced economies \u2014does have some effect on emerging markets, particularly those who are trying to pe g their exchange rate, and can lead to some capital inflows or outflows .  But there are also other factors that affect inflows and outflows .  Those include changes in risk preference by investors, changes in growth expectations, different perceptions of institutional strength within emerging markets across different countries .  So there are a lot of factors that are there playing a role, and that \u2019s one reason why different emerging markets have had different experiences .  They have different institutional structures and different policies .  But , just to come to the bottom line here, we think it \u2019s very important that emerging markets grow and  are prosperous .  We pay close attention to what \u2019s happening in those countries \u2014it affects the United States .   The main point, I guess, I would end with, though , is that what we \u2019re trying to do with our monetary policy here is, I think, my colleagues in the emerging markets recognize , is trying to create a stronger U .S. economy .  And a stronger U .S. economy is one of the most important things that could happen to help the economies of emerging markets .  And, again, I think my colleagues in many of the emerging markets appreciate that \u2014not withstanding some of the effects that they may have felt \u2014that efforts to strengthen the U .S. economy and other advanced econom ies in Europe and elsewhere ultimately redounds  to the benefit of the global economy ,  7 including emerging markets as well.

They acknowledged improvements in the labor market but expressed concern over high unemployment rates and declining labor force participation.The tightening of financial conditions could slow the pace of economic improvement, and federal fiscal policy continues to restrain growth. Inflation has remained below the Committee's objective, but recent factors have led to moderately higher inflation and the Committee expects it to gradually move back toward 2 percent.The FOMC projects moderate economic growth, gradual progress towards unemployment and inflation goals, and continues accommodative policies due to elevated unemployment and low inflation. The Committee is providing policy support through asset purchases and communicating plans for setting the federal funds rate target.The FOMC announced in September 2012 that they would purchase $40 billion per month in agency mortgage-backed securities, in addition to the $45 billion per month in longer-term Treasury securities they were already acquiring. They stated that purchases would continue until there was a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.Despite the negative impact of fiscal headwinds on economic growth and employment, the FOMC believed that substantial improvement in the labor market outlook could be achieved in the next year. However, the Committee decided not to reduce the pace of asset purchases at the current meeting due to insufficient confirmation of the economic outlook and concerns about the tightening of financial conditions.The FOMC has decided to wait for more evidence of sustained recovery before adjusting the pace of asset purchases, while continuing to closely monitor economic and financial developments. The Committee's decisions on asset purchases will depend on the economic outlook and ongoing assessment of the program's efficacy and costs.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projects that the first increase in short-term rates will not occur until the unemployment rate is considerably below 6\u00c2\u00bd percent. Most participants expect the first rate increase to take place in 2015, and the funds rate target is projected to rise slowly after policy accommodation is removed.In response to a question from Pedro da Costa of Reuters, the Chairman acknowledges the progress made in the labor market but highlights that a significant portion of the decline in the unemployment rate is due to a decrease in participation. Pedro da Costa then asks about the potential jobless rate if not for the decline in participation, suggesting estimates as high as 10 to 11 percent, and requests the Chairman to provide context on the labor market.\"The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\" \n\nSummary: The Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low until the labor market improves and inflation reaches and exceeds 2 percent. They will also continue to buy Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities until there is significant progress towards their employment and price stability goals.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': How high do you think the jobless rate would be if it were not for the decline in participation?\n'ANSWER': The unemployment rate understates the true amount of unemployment in the economy due to a cyclical component and a downward trend in participation. However, most of the improvement in the unemployment rate in the last year is due to job creation rather than lower participation. The broader measures of unemployment have also fallen, indicating progress in the labor market.", "'QUESTION': To what extent do you regard yourself as responsible for the tightening in financial conditions that you noted? Was it a mistake to talk about tapering in the way that you did in June and do you still expect that it will be appropriate to dial down asset purchases by the end of this year?\n'ANSWER': Communication is crucial in monetary policy, and we tried to be clear. In June, we believed we had made progress in the labor market and it was time to discuss the eventual wind-down of the program. Our goal is to achieve a substantial improvement in the labor market, and we will continue to assess the data to determine if tapering is appropriate. Our intent is to maintain an accommodative policy to support the economy and job creation.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide more clarity on when the pullback of purchases is likely to start and if the 7 percent unemployment number is still relevant?\n'ANSWER': There is no fixed schedule for the pullback, it will depend on data confirming our outlook and meeting the three-part test. The subsequent steps will depend on continued progress in the economy. The criterion for ending the asset purchases program is a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook, not necessarily a specific unemployment rate. We are looking for overall improvement in the labor market.", "'QUESTION': Have you indicated to President Obama you did not want to serve a third term? If so, when? Or did President Obama indicate to you he did not want you to serve a third term? And would you serve a third term if asked, either wholly or in part?\n\n'ANSWER': I prefer not to talk about my plans at this point. I hope to have more information for you at some reasonably soon date, but today I want to focus on monetary policy. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d prefer not to talk about my own plans.", "'QUESTION': What are the reasons for tighter financial conditions?\n'ANSWER': Tighter financial conditions are partly due to improved economic news and views about monetary policy. It is also a result of unwinding risky positions in the markets, which although unwelcome, makes the situation more sustainable. Clear communication is crucial to avoid sharp movements in the markets.", "'QUESTION': Can you give us any sense of when you and when the Committee expect interest rates to get back to that 4 percent figure?\n'ANSWER': The large majority of FOMC participants estimate that the appropriate target for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 will be around 2 percent. Factors such as slow recovery of the housing sector, fiscal drag, and effects from the financial crisis may still be headwinds to the recovery, resulting in lower rates for a time. It may take a few more years after 2016 to reach the 4 percent level.", "'QUESTION': At what point will the Fed consider other costs and benefits when deciding to lower the pace of purchases, even if the growth forecast has not been met in the past four years? Does the complexity of this decision require a press conference?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has been over-optimistic about future growth due to the aftermath of the financial crisis, which has temporarily slowed the potential growth rate of the economy. Monetary policy affects the cyclical part of growth, not the long-run potential. Unemployment has fallen faster than anticipated. Press conferences can be arranged if additional explanation is needed.", "'QUESTION': Are the Fed's projections of inflation below target inconsistent with the decision to raise the federal funds rate?\n'ANSWER': The Fed should be reluctant to raise rates if inflation remains persistently below target, and there is a possibility of adding an inflation floor to the guidance. The Fed is discussing how to clarify the guidance on the federal funds rate and is considering additional guidance on inflation.", "'QUESTION': Are there concerns that the Fed is confusing investors and sending mixed signals by not pulling back the bond-buying program?\n'ANSWER': The Fed did not make any specific commitments in this meeting. The decision to not pull back the bond-buying program was based on the assessment that the data since June did not meet the standard of confirming the outlook for increasing growth, improving labor markets, and inflation moving towards target. The Fed will continue to communicate with markets, but policy actions will be determined by the best assessment of what is needed for the economy.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about a government shutdown and what would be the impact on the economy? Would the Fed be prepared to respond with additional accommodation?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is concerned about upcoming fiscal policy decisions, including the possibility of a government shutdown and the debt limit issue. A government shutdown or failure to raise the debt limit could have serious consequences for the financial markets and the economy. The Fed's policy is to do whatever it can to keep the economy on course, but its ability to offset these shocks is limited. It is important for Congress and the Administration to work together to avoid any adverse effects on confidence and the economy.", "'QUESTION': What is Chairman Bernanke's biggest regret regarding the financial crisis and does he believe that necessary measures have been put in place to prevent another crisis?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke's biggest regret is not being able to prevent the crisis, but he believes that once it started, it was difficult to stop. He agrees with Hank Paulson that the bank bailouts were for the broader public's interest. Progress has been made with the Dodd-Frank law, Basel III, and better capitalization and supervision of financial firms, but more work needs to be done, especially in resolution regimes and derivatives.", "'QUESTION': To what extent are arguments about the diminished effectiveness of quantitative easing and regulatory impediments to growth valid? How will the Fed get out of quantitative easing if the economy does not improve?\n'ANSWER': The effectiveness of asset purchases is difficult to measure precisely, but they have been effective in strengthening financial conditions and promoting recovery. Despite fiscal policies that hindered growth, there has been progress in the labor market. Monetary policy cannot address all economic factors, but the Fed will continue to provide accommodative measures to support growth even if asset purchases are reduced.", "QUESTION: Were you intending a surprise today, and did you get the intended result, judging from the market reaction? And by continuing bond purchases, at what point do you believe you're starting to complicate the exit strategy?\nANSWER: Our intention was to set policy as appropriate for the economy. We want to see the effects of higher interest rates on the economy, particularly in mortgage rates and housing. This step was precautionary, and we will wait to get confirming evidence on the economy. We have tools to manage interest rates and unwind the balance sheet when needed.", "'QUESTION': Do you think that all of the recent attention being paid to who will be your replacement has had any immediate effect on the Fed, and could it have any lingering effect on your successor? And also, do you think the process has just become too politicized, or is this part of a healthy debate?\n'ANSWER': I think the Federal Reserve has strong institutional credibility. And it is a strong institution, a highly competent institution, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s independent, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nonpartisan, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not particularly concerned about the political environment for the Federal Reserve. I think the Fed will be \u00e2\u0080\u0094continue to be an important institution in the United States, and that it will maintain its independence going forward.", "'QUESTION': How would you assess the impact of quantitative easing and Fed policies on the poverty rate and income inequality?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve acknowledges the issue of poverty and income inequality, but these long-term trends cannot be fully addressed by the Fed. Congress and the Administration have the power to take steps to address these issues. The Fed's main goals are maximum employment and price stability, which indirectly benefit the average American. However, a mix of tools including fiscal policy is needed to tackle these long-term trends.", "QUESTION: Some emerging countries are blaming the Fed policies for their financial distress. What is your take on that? And how did you judge the way the markets reacted to your tapering announcement back in June?\n\nANSWER: Changes in longer-term interest rates in the US and other advanced economies can affect emerging markets, particularly those trying to peg their exchange rate. However, there are also other factors at play, such as risk preference, growth expectations, and institutional strength. The Fed's goal is to create a stronger US economy, which ultimately benefits the global economy, including emerging markets."]}
