In  other words, part of the slowdown is temporary, and part of it may be longe r lasting.  We do believe that growth is going to pick up going into 2012 but at a somewhat slower pace from\u2014than we had anticipated in April.  We don\u2019t have a preci se read on why this slower pa ce of growth is persisting.  June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 6 of 22  One way to think about it is that maybe some  of the headwinds that have been concerning us, like, you know, weakness in the financial sector, problems in the housing sector, balance sheet and deleveraging issues\u2014some of these headwi nds may be stronger or more persistent than we thought.  And I think it\u2019s an appropriate balance to attribut e a slowdown partly to these identifiable temporary factors bu t to acknowledge a possibility that  some of the slowdown is due to factors which are longer lived and which will be still operative by next year.  You note that, in 2013, we have growth at about the same ra te that we anticipated in April.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, could you desc ribe to what extent the situation in Greece and Europe was discussed at the meeting and what policy conclusions were reached?  And also could you tell us whether or not, in  response to the recent slowdown, there was a discussion about further easing?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, with resp ect to Greece, that\u2019s obviously very important.  That\u2014it\u2019s a very difficult situati on.  We\u2019ve been in close communication with our colleagues in Europe\u2014obviously not part of the negotiations, but we\u2019ve been kept well informed.  We had a G-7 call over the weekend, for example.  I think the Europeans appreciate the incredible importance of resolv ing the Greek situation.  If there were a failure to resolve that situation, it would pose threats to the European financial system, the global financial system, and to European political unity, I woul d conjecture as well.  So, yes, we  did discuss it.  It\u2019s one of several potential financial risks th at we\u2019re facing now.  But, agai n, we are mostly just following the\u2014the situation closely and making sure that, as best we can, that our own institutions are well positioned relative to sovereign debt in  the so-called peripheral countries.   With respect to additional a sset purchases, we haven\u2019t take n any action, obviously, today.  We\u2019ll be reviewing the outlook going forward.  It  will be a Committee decision.  I think the point June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 7 of 22  I would make, though, in terms of where we are t oday versus where we were, say, in August of last year when I began to talk a bout asset purchases, is  that at that time, inflation was very low and falling.  Many objective indicators suggested that  deflation was a nontrivial risk.  And I think that the securities purchases have been very suc cessful in eliminating defl ation risk.  I don\u2019t think people appreciate necessarily that  deflation can be a very pern icious situation where it could have very long-lasting eff ects on economic growth.   In addition, growth in payrolls  has actually picked up.  In the four months before the Jackson Hole speech in August, there was about an 80,000 per month payroll increase.  So far in 2011, including the weak payroll re port in May, the average is cl oser to 180,000.  So there has been improvement in the labor market, albeit not as  strong as we would like .  As of last August, we were essentially missing significantly in bo th\u2014on both sides of our mandate.  Inflation was too low and falling, and unemployment looked like it might be even beginning to rise again.  In that case, the case for monetary action was pretty clear in my mind.  I think we are in a different position today\u2014certainly not where we\u2019d like to be, but closer to the dual-mandate objectives than we were at that time.  So, again, the situat ion is different today than  last August, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor the ec onomy and act as needed.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Luca DiLeo, Dow Jones.  Would budget cuts, which may begin at the end of this year, help or hinde r the economy?  This goes back to  the other question:  What\u2019s fiscal policy like in the 2012 growth forecast? \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: The effect of fis cal cuts on the economy depends very much on the timing.  I\u2019ve advocated th at the negotiations about the budget focus on the longer term, say, 10 years, which is the budget window, or ev en longer if you\u2019re taking into account entitlement reform, for example.  By taking a lo ng-run perspective, we can help the economy by June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 8 of 22  reducing the risk that interest ra tes might rise suddenly.  We may help increase confidence in the part of households and businesses. And so I think it\u2019s very desirable that we take strong action to lower our budget deficits over the longer term.   In doing that, I think it would be best not t o\u2014in light of the weakness of the recovery, it would be best not to have sudden and sharp fiscal  consolidation in the very near term.  That doesn\u2019t do so much for the long-run budget situation.  It just is a negative for growth.  So my answer is that it depends very much on the timi ng, and I hope that the co ngressional negotiators will take a longer-term view as th ey\u2014as they discuss the issue.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Darren Gersh with Nightly Business Report  on PBS.  If I could follow up on what he just said, there seems to be a growing view in the coun try that the deficit is the problem with jobs, and that  immediate cuts in the defi cit would grow the economy and immediately create jobs.  Many eco nomists disagree with that.  Do  you want to go a little further and maybe talk about that issue, and whether you agree with that view that seems to be taking root? \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: I don\u2019t think that sharp, immediate cuts in the deficit would create more jobs.  I think in the very short r un that we are seeing already a certain amount of fiscal drag coming from state and local governments,  as well as from the withdrawal of previous federal stimulus.  So I think in the very short run that , you know, the fiscal tightening is\u2014is, at best, neutral but probably somewh at negative for job creation. I think what people will understand, should understand, is that our budgetary problems are very long run in nature.  The projections made by the CBO, for example, talk about where our debt-to-GDP ratio will be in 2020, 2025, and so on.  That doesn\u2019t mean we should wait to act.  The sooner we can act, the better.  But th e most efficient and effective way to address our June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 9 of 22  fiscal problems\u2014and, again, I think this is extremely important\u2014is to take a longer-run perspective, not to focus the cuts heavily on th e near term.  But by taking a long-run perspective and making a credible plan for reducing future defi cits, we\u2019ll lower interest rates, or at least prevent them from rising, and we w ill increase confidence.  And that could be very constructive.  But if it\u2019s entirely focused on the near term, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the optimal way to proceed.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, Neil Irwin with the Washington Post .  Do you believe that the FOMC has the authority to set a, say, 2 per cent inflation target on its  own, unilaterally, or do you believe that it would need to go to Congress to get that target made more explicit?  If the former, are you considering doing it ?  If the latter, ar e you considering going to Congress to ask them to do it?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, Neil, as you know, I\u2019ve been a long-time proponent of an inflation target.  I think that it would help an chor inflation expectat ions; it would make it easier to reach our inflation objec tive.  At the same time, it\u2019s not  at all inconsistent with our employment objective because keep ing inflation low and stable, k eeping inflation expectations low and stable, actually gives th e Fed more leeway to respond to short-term shocks to the economy.  So I think it\u2019s something, you know, that is worth considering.   In terms of authorities, I w ould just say that there are multiple models around the world.  So, for example, in the European Central Bank,  that bank has a mandate for price stability, period.  And they set their own definition of that  using input from economists and others.  So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a real barrier to  setting a target.  However, it is very important that, first, that we communicate to the public  what we\u2019re doing.  Without  sufficient explanation and background, many people might think that we  were somehow abandoning our employment target.  So we need to make sure that that\u2019s  well understood both by the public and by Congress June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 10 of 22  that having a target would not mean that we we re abandoning the other le g of the dual mandate.  Also, you asked about consulting with Congress.  I think under any circumstances, it would be important to take the pulse of Congress.  They\u2014w e might have the legal au thority to do this, but I think we do need some buy-in from the Administ ration and Congress to take  that step.  We are continuing to periodically discuss this issue.   It\u2019s been part of  our ongoing communications discussion, which included this press conferen ce as one innovation, for example.  There\u2019s nothing imminent.  But, again, we\u2019ll continue to  discuss this, and, as appropriate, we\u2019ll be consulting about it.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times .  What is your assessment of the impact on the United States ec onomy if there is a default by one or more European nations?  What steps has the Fed taken to assess the consequences for American financial institutions?  And, in particular, have you examined the impact on derivatives holdings outside of the regulated financial system? \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, to answer yo ur second question first, we have been very assiduous in examining the exposures of fi nancial institutions to the so-called peripheral countries.  The answer is that the banks that  we regulate are not si gnificantly exposed to\u2014to those countries directly, at least.  They have significant exposures to European banks in the nonperipheral countries, and so indi rectly, they have that exposu re.  The\u2014and that statement which I just made includes credit default swap s and so on.  The gross numbers that the BIS publishes do not fully account for a wide variet y of hedges and other positions.  So we have asked the banks to essentially do stress tests and ask, looking at all their positions, all their hedges, What would the effect on their capital be if Greece defaulted?  And the answer is that the effects are very small.   June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 11 of 22  It\u2019s also the case that\u2014well, we don\u2019t oversee the money market mutual funds.  We have been keeping a close eye on that si tuation.  There again, the situation is similar in some sense, in that except\u2014with very few exceptions, the money market mutual funds don\u2019t have much direct exposure to the three peripheral c ountries which are currently deali ng with debt pr oblems.  They do have very substantial exposure to European ba nks in the so-called co re countries:  Germany, France, et cetera.  So to the extent that ther e is indirect impact on\u2014on the core European banks, that does pose some concern to money market mutual funds and is a reason why the Federal Reserve and other regulators are co ntinuing to look at ways to st rengthen money market mutual funds.   In terms of the impact of the problem in Greece on the United States, as I\u2019ve indicated, the direct exposures are pretty small, and we\u2019re doing all we can to monitor those exposures.  However, as we saw in a small situation, a small case last spring, a disorderly default in one of those countries would no doubt ro il financial markets globally.  It would have a big impact on credit spreads, on stock prices, and so on.  And so, in that respect, I think the effects on the United States would be  quite significant.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker .  To talk about\u2014further about banks, as you know, global regu lators are meeting this week to finalize a proposal that would name the worl d\u2019s most significantly banks and as well as a surcharge.  There are some that are arguing that  regulators are going too far, too fast.  And I\u2019m wondering, for regulators, you know, where is the line wher e you\u2014to pass, where you go too far, and you do hurt credit lending and inevitably hurt the economy?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: So I\u2019ll be attending that meeting, and so I\u2019ll have a chance to hear others\u2019 views and to contribute to that discussion.  It\u2019s only been  two years since we had June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 12 of 22  the worst financial crisis certainly since the Gr eat Depression and possibly in the history of the United States.  And the failure or near failure  of large financial institutions was a major contributor to that cris is.  Since we can\u2019t know exactly what  threats will come in the future, probably the best all-purpose wa y of strengthening the balanc e sheets of banks and other financial institutions is by capital.  And I\u2019m very supportive of increased capital to\u2014and better quality capital\u2014to help ensure that these banks w ill be stable and able to lend in the event of another crisis, which I hope we don\u2019t, of course, ever see.  In terms of the SIFI surcharge,  so-called, I think it\u2019s also appropriate to have additional capital requirements for the largest and most syst emically important institutions.  After all, it\u2019s because their failure would have very deleterious e ffects in the financial system, we need to take extra steps to make sure that th ey will be very unlikely to fa il.  In addition, it provides some more level playing field because, by having higher  equity requirements, the largest institutions avoid some of the funding advantages that would otherwise accrue to firms that are viewed as being too big to fail.  So I think it\u2019s very important to do that.  And we\u2019ll be negotiating, discussing with our collea gues internationally what the appropr iate number of fi rms is, what the appropriate criteria are,  and what the amount of capital s hould be.  In choosing the amount of capital, we will certainly be trying to weigh off and balance, on the one hand, the need for extra safety of systemically important firms agai nst the impacts on lending and so on.  Although I would note that, since systemically important fi rms are only part of the banking system, to the extent that they reduce their lending, some of that lending might go to other institutions.   In terms of going too far, you know, it\u2019s ver y, very difficult to make a broad-based assessment of the overall impact of all of the rules and regulations.  Bu t I would like to make clear that, both by law and by our internal pr actices, the Federal Reserve does cost-benefit June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 13 of 22  analysis of every rule that we write, and we publis h those.  So we are looking at the cost-benefit for these regulations.  Moreover, we have wo rked with\u2014the Federal Reserve has worked actively with the BIS, the Basel Committee, to do analyses of the effects of capital requirements, on the one hand, on the probability of a crisis, a nd on the other hand, on the cost of lending and the effect on growth.  Those studies have b een published.  And if you look at them, you\u2019ll see that we believe that the capital which has been  imposed so far would significantly reduce the threat of a massive financial crisis and, on the ot her hand, have very small effects on growth.  So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re on the wrong side of  that tradeoff at this point.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Robi n Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, you now expect that both headline and core inflati on would be close to your  long-run objective in 2012 and 2013 while unemployment remains high.  Does that mean you think the medium-term tradeoff between inflation and growth has got worse?  And, furthermore, can I ask\u2014Has the unexpected rise in core infla tion changed your understanding of the output gap?  Thank you\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, to address the la tter question first, th at\u2019s a possibility.  As you saw from the\u2014but as you saw from the projections we just put out, the Committee\u2014every member of the Committee sees the long -run unemployment rate\u2014the NAIRU, as it\u2019s called by economists\u2014somewhere around 5\u00bd percent, ba sically.  So that would suggest that the Committee still believes that the output gap is quit e large.  With respect to core inflation, some of the effects, at leas t there, are also temporary.  To name two examples, the supply chain disruptions brought about by the Japa nese disaster have led to a ve ry significant increase in auto prices, both new and used automobiles, last month.  As these problems are resolved\u2014and they appear to be very much on the way to being re solved\u2014we would assume that the auto prices would come back down and incentives would be re stored as competition increases and costs are June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 14 of 22  reduced.  So that\u2019s one example.  Another woul d be the fact that en ergy prices have passed through to a number of\u2014despite th e fact that core is defined excluding energy, that\u2019s only the energy, direct energy products\u2014things like airfares, for example, which are very sensitive to the cost of jet fuel, are also a part of the core.  So you would imagine that , as the price of oil declines, that you would see some bounce\u2014dec line in, also in\u2014in the core measures of inflation.  So given that there\u2019s still a large output gap, given that inflation expectations remain well anchored, given that some of the temporar y factors affecting infl ation, including core inflation, are likely to recede, I think it\u2019s reasona ble to think that core inflation will fall back towards mandate-consistent levels .  That being said, I think it \u2019s the case, if you look at the projections that we have marked up a little bit, the near-term and core projections.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Barnes, Fox Business,  Mr. Chairman.

And, if not, can you sort of give us a time frame for sort of in the long run, when we return to normal? \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, we expect \u2014as the projections show, we expect growth in the second half of this y ear and next year to be certainly faster than it\u2019s been so far in 2011.

Mr. Chairman, given your response just now, and given the Fed\u2019s belief that  the recent uptick inflation is transitory, why wouldn\u2019t the Fed consider taking more action to st imulate growth?  And if it would consider that, would bond purchases be your preference, or woul d communications tactics, such as the one suggested by Jon, also be on the table as you cons ider how to get the eco nomy growing again?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, there are a couple of considerations.  One, as I indicated before, is that the current outlook is si gnificantly different than  what we were facing in\u2014in August of last year.  We no longer have a deflation risk.  Infl ation is above\u2014at the moment, is above target.  We expect it to fall, but we\u2019re no longer\u2014 certainly not in any deflationary situation.  And notwithstanding th e disappointing news recently, the labor market has been performing better than it was last year.  On top of th at, we have an awful lot of uncertainty right now about how much of this sl owdown is temporary, how much is permanent.  So that would suggest, all else equa l, that a little bit of time to see what\u2019s going to happen is\u2014it would be useful in making policy decisions.  We \u2019ll continue to look at  the outlook and act, you know, as appropriately as the news comes in a nd the projections change.  We do have a number of ways of acting; none of them are without ri sks or costs.  We could, for example, do more securities purchases and structur e them in different ways.  We could cut the interest on excess reserves that we pay to banks.  And as was suggested by an earlier question\u2014several earlier questions, actually\u2014Jon\u2019s question about givi ng guidance on the balance sheet or by perhaps even giving a fixed date, you know, to define \u201cexte nded period,\u201d those are ways that we could June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 19 of 22  ease further if needed.

During the Japanese lo st decade in the 1990s, you strongly criticized Japan\u2019s lack of policies.

Based on thos e points with QE2 ending, what do you think of Japan\u2019s experience and the reality facing the U.S.?  Are there any historical lessons that we should be reminded about?  Thank you. \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, I\u2019m a little bi t more sympathetic to central bankers now than I was 10 years ago.  I think it\u2019s very important to understand that in my comments\u2014both in my comment in the published comment a decade ago as well as in my speech in 2002 about deflation\u2014my main point was that a determined central  bank can always do something about deflation.  After all, infl ation is a monetary phenomenon, a central bank can always create money, and so on.  I also argued\u2014and I think it \u2019s well understood that deflation, persistent deflation can be a very debilita ting factor in\u2014in growth and empl oyment in an economy.  So we acted on that advice here in the Un ited States, as I just  described, in August, September of last year.  We could infer from, say, TIPS prices \u2014inflation index bond pri ces\u2014that investors saw something on the order of a one-third chance of outright deflation going forward.  So there was a significant risk there.  The securities purchases that  we did were intended, in part, to end that risk of deflation.  And I think it\u2019s widely agreed th at we succeeded in ending that deflation risk.  I think also that our policies were  constructive on the employment si de.  This, I realize, is a bit more controversial.  But we did take actions as needed, even though we were at the zero lower June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 20 of 22  bound of interest rates, to address deflation.

On  your point about permanent factors, housing, back in February\u2014actually, November, you had said that a second asset\u2014a second round of asset purchases would go ahead  and ease mortgage ra tes and make housing more affordable.  You\u2019ve seen housing become mo re affordable; you\u2019ve seen rates decline.  But you\u2019re seeing underlying fundamentals in the sector  still very weak\u2014starts,  sales, and prices.  Many economists have pushed back any and all economic forecasts for the sector to 2013\u20132014 for any meaningful rebound.  What could be done for that sector as  far as\u2014to stimulate growth?   June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 21 of 22\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: .  Well, the housing sector is very important to the overall recovery, and so we\u2019ve paid a lot of attention to that.  We did\u2014as you point out, we did succeed in significantly lowering the mortgage rates.  So those who can get credit, together with the low prices of houses, are at\u2014able to  buy much more house than they could have a few years ago.   Unfortunately, there are problems, including th e fact that credit standards for mortgages have tightened quite considerably so that roughly a bottom\u2014the bottom third of people who might have qualified for a prime mortgage in te rms of, say, FICO scores a few years ago cannot qualify today.  So that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s ce rtainly an important problem.  Th ere\u2019s also evidently a lot of uncertainty about employment, about the econo mic recovery, and that\u2019s affecting people\u2019s willingness to make the commitment to buy a hou se.  So there are a number of fundamental factors which are slowing th e housing market down, and th ey do present very difficult challenges.  The Fed is trying to address this in  a number of ways.  Of course, our monetary policy is intended to try to promote employment and income gains, which, of course, will help housing demand.  As regulators, we have recently issued cease-and- desist orders to servicers to try and improve servicing practices.  We work with our regulated banks to ask them to do modifications where appropriate and to manage th eir REO\u2014real estate owned\u2014real estate in an economy-supportive way.   We\u2019ve also\u2014the Federal Reserve has also be en very much involved in giving input to other agencies which have res ponsibilities for housing.  For exampl e, we have provided advice to the Treasury on their modificati on programs.  In fact, I am\u2014ex officio, I am the head of the oversight board for the TARP, which is\u2014now mos tly consists of HAMP, the housing program.  So, in that context, I\u2019m kept well informed.  So  the Federal Reserve is doing a lot and doing what it can.  I think otherw ise I\u2019d like to see just further efforts to\u2014first of all, to modify loans where June 22, 2011 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 22 of 22  appropriate; to\u2014and where not appr opriate, to speed the process of foreclosure and disposition of the foreclosed homes in order to clear the market; get these homes out of the pipeline; and allow people to, you know, to operate in a market where they\u2019re more confident that prices will be stable rather than falling.  It\u2019s inte resting now that\u2014although house prices overall are declining, all of that is concentr ated in distressed properties; th at is, houses which are not being sold on a distressed basis have much more stab le prices than those wh ich are being sold on a distressed basis.  And that suggests that, if we  can reduce the current number and something of more than a third, maybe 40 percent of home sale s which are on a distressed basis, that would do a lot to stabilizing the market and helping give people confidence that they can buy, and not be buying into a falling market.

The Committee also announced the completion of its planned purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and the continuation of reinvesting principal payments.The FOMC projections, which represent participants' assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy, show a central tendency for longer-run projections of output growth and unemployment rate. These projections, however, are uncertain and subject to revision due to nonmonetary factors that cannot be directly measured.The Committee's economic outlook suggests that the recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace, but slower than expected, with weaker labor market indicators. Factors such as higher food and energy prices and disruptions in global supply chains have contributed to the reduced pace, but there is optimism for improvement in the coming months and projected growth rates for the next few years.The FOMC expects the unemployment rate to gradually decline towards levels consistent with their dual mandate, projecting it to reach 7.0 to 7.5 percent by the fourth quarter of 2013. However, they acknowledge that progress is frustratingly slow. Additionally, they anticipate that inflation will subside to levels at or below their mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy due to the presence of labor market slack and a subdued inflation outlook, leading them to believe that exceptionally low interest rates will be necessary for an extended period. The speaker expresses gratitude and openness to answering any questions.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Does the FOMC's policy of maintaining low interest rates for an extended period also apply to the Fed's securities holdings?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC has not made any commitment regarding the maintenance of its securities holdings at a high level for an extended period. The decision to allow the portfolio to run off instead of reinvesting would be the first step in exiting from accommodative policies, but no specific time frame has been chosen. The appropriate time to take that step will be determined based on the outlook.", "'QUESTION': Why give guidance on one policy tool but not another when they are supposed to work together?\n'ANSWER': We have considered giving guidance on both policy tools, but we have not taken that step yet. The Committee lowered the central tendency forecast for both this year and 2012, attributing most of the revision to temporary factors. It is possible that there are more permanent factors holding back the recovery.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain why the recovery is being held back and if there are more permanent factors contributing to a worse outlook than three months ago?\n'ANSWER': The slowdown in growth is partly due to temporary factors, but there may also be longer-lasting factors at play, such as weakness in the financial and housing sectors. It is possible that some of these headwinds are stronger or more persistent than previously thought. However, growth is expected to pick up in 2012 and remain steady in 2013.", "'QUESTION': To what extent was the situation in Greece and Europe discussed at the meeting and what policy conclusions were reached? Was there a discussion about further easing in response to the recent slowdown?\n'ANSWER': The situation in Greece was discussed and it is seen as very important. The Federal Reserve has been in close communication with European colleagues and understands the risks it poses to the global financial system. No action was taken on further easing, but the outlook will be reviewed and a decision will be made by the Committee.

What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fiscal policy like in the 2012 growth forecast?\n'ANSWER': The effect of fiscal cuts on the economy depends on the timing. Taking a long-term perspective can help reduce the risk of sudden interest rate increases and increase confidence. It is desirable to lower budget deficits over the longer term, but sudden and sharp fiscal consolidation in the near term would be negative for growth. Congressional negotiators should take a longer-term view.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree with the view that immediate cuts in the deficit would grow the economy and create jobs?\n'ANSWER': I don't think immediate cuts in the deficit would create more jobs. In the short run, fiscal tightening is likely to have a negative impact on job creation. Our budgetary problems are long-term, and the most effective way to address them is to take a longer-run perspective and make a credible plan for reducing future deficits. This will lower interest rates and increase confidence, which could be very constructive. Focusing solely on the near term is not the optimal approach.", "'QUESTION': Do you believe that the FOMC has the authority to set a 2 percent inflation target on its own, or would it need to go to Congress for approval?\n'ANSWER': I believe that the FOMC has the authority to set an inflation target, similar to how the European Central Bank sets its own definition of price stability. However, it is important to communicate this to the public and Congress to ensure they understand that we are not abandoning our employment target. We will continue to discuss this and consult with Congress as necessary.", "'QUESTION': What is the impact on the US economy if there is a default by one or more European nations? What steps has the Fed taken to assess the consequences for American financial institutions? Have they examined the impact on derivatives holdings outside of the regulated financial system?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has examined the exposures of financial institutions to peripheral countries and found that the banks they regulate are not significantly exposed to those countries directly. However, they do have significant exposures to European banks in nonperipheral countries, including credit default swaps. Stress tests have been conducted to assess the effect of a Greek default on capital, which was found to be very small. Money market mutual funds have limited exposure to peripheral countries but substantial exposure to core European banks. A disorderly default in one of those countries would have a significant impact on the US economy.", "'QUESTION': Where is the line for regulators in terms of going too far and hurting credit lending and the economy?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman believes that increasing capital requirements for banks is necessary to strengthen their balance sheets and ensure stability. He supports additional capital requirements for the largest and most systemically important institutions to prevent their failure. The Federal Reserve conducts cost-benefit analysis for regulations and believes that the imposed capital requirements would reduce the threat of a financial crisis without significantly impacting growth.", "'QUESTION': Does the unexpected rise in core inflation change your understanding of the output gap?\n'ANSWER': The rise in core inflation may be temporary due to factors such as supply chain disruptions and energy prices. As these factors resolve and the output gap remains large, it is reasonable to expect that core inflation will fall back towards mandate-consistent levels. However, near-term and core projections have been marked up slightly.", "'QUESTION': What is the extended period for exceptionally low fed funds rates and under what conditions would it be extended even longer?\n'ANSWER': The extended period is not known exactly, but it is believed to be at least two or three meetings away from taking further action. Depending on how the economy evolves, it could be significantly longer. Improved job creation and inflation close to or above the mandate-consistent level would signal the need to consider beginning an exit process, but we are not there yet.", "'QUESTION': What would happen if the situation in Europe worsens and becomes a contagion situation?\n'ANSWER': If the economy worsens and inflation remains low, the Federal Reserve would not begin to exit and would not change their language.

I believe the slowdown is partly temporary and that we will see greater growth going forward. On tax policy, it is important to urgently address the overall fiscal situation, but the specifics are the responsibility of Congress.", "'QUESTION': Do you expect there to be a structural issue with weak job growth and when do you anticipate a return to normal?\n'ANSWER': We expect job growth to improve in the second half of this year and next year, but the unemployment rate will come down slowly. It will take faster growth than the long-run potential to bring down unemployment, and we are still years away from full employment. This prolonged unemployment can have significant long-term consequences.", "'QUESTION': Given the belief that recent inflation is transitory, why wouldn't the Fed consider taking more action to stimulate growth? And if it would consider that, what methods would be preferred?\n'ANSWER': The current outlook is different from last year, with no deflation risk and inflation above target. There is uncertainty about the extent of the slowdown. The Fed will continue to assess the outlook and act accordingly. Options include securities purchases, cutting interest on excess reserves, and providing guidance on the balance sheet or a fixed date for extended period. Additional action would be taken if conditions warranted.", "QUESTION: What is Chairman Bernanke's view on Japan's experience and the reality facing the U.S. in terms of economic policies?\nANSWER: Chairman Bernanke believes that a determined central bank can always do something about deflation, as inflation is a monetary phenomenon. He argues that deflation can be detrimental to growth and employment, and the actions taken by the Federal Reserve in the U.S. were successful in ending the risk of deflation and had a positive impact on employment.", "'QUESTION': Do you and your colleagues have a statistical trigger for beginning the exit process?\n'ANSWER': No, it is impossible to create a statistical trigger because each member of the FOMC has their own views on the outlook, monetary policy, and risks. Staff produce scenarios that give some indication of likely exit points, but these projections are tentative and subject to change based on new information.", "QUESTION: What can be done to stimulate growth in the housing sector?\nANSWER: The housing sector is important to the overall recovery, and while mortgage rates have been lowered, there are still problems such as tightened credit standards and uncertainty about employment and the economic recovery. The Fed is addressing this through monetary policy, working with banks on modifications and managing real estate owned properties, and providing advice to other agencies responsible for housing. Efforts to modify loans and speed up the foreclosure process are also needed to stabilize the market and increase confidence in buying."]}
