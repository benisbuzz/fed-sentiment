On the broader economy, can you clarify how worried the FOMC is about a steep slowdown?   Some of the actions today March 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 5 o f 23  look like there is more worry .  And on the balance sheet, can you clar ify:  Does the FOMC see the runoff as  a form of monetary tightening?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, on the outlook, our outlook is a positive one.  So, as I mentioned, FOMC participants continue to see growth this year of around 2 percent, just a bit below what we saw  back in \u2014at the end of last year.  And part of that is seeing that economic fundamentals \u2014underlying economic fundamentals are still very strong.  You have a strong labor market by most measures.  You have rising incomes.  You \u2019ve got very low unemployment.  You have confiden ce surveys for households and also for businesses that are at attractive levels, and you also have financial conditions that are more accommodative than they were a couple of months ago.  So we see the outlook as a positive one. As far as  balance sheet \u2014the balance sheet plan, the answer to that is, you asked whether that\u2019s related to our monetary policy , in effect, and the answer is really \u201c no.\u201d  We are\u2014we still\u2014we think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy, and we think of ourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months .  And we \u2019re not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, can you talk about how global developments are affecting the U.S.?  What \u2019s the cause of the weakness over there?  How much is it responsible for the downgrade in GDP over here ?  And what impact are tariffs , both in the United States and retal iatory tariffs , having on both the U.S. and the global economies?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So the global economy was a tailwind for the United States in 2017.  That was the year of synchronized global growth.   And we began 2018 expecting and hoping for more of the same.  What happened instead is that the global economy started to gradually slow, March 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 6 o f 23  and now we see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially \u2014and so has the Chinese economy, although the European economy more.  And just as st rong global growth was a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy.  How big is that effect?  It \u2019s hard to be precise about it, but , clearly , we will feel that.  It is an integrated global economy, and global financial markets are int egrated as well.  In terms of what \u2019s causing it, it seems to be a range of different things.  In China , you have, you know, factors that are very specific to China.  The main point , though, is that, I would say, the outlook\u2014let \u2019s look at the outlook.  Chinese authorities have taken many steps since the middle of last year to support economic activity, and I think the base case is that , ultimately , Chinese activity will stabilize at an attractive level.  And in Europe, you know, we see some weakening, but, again, we don\u2019 t see\u2014we don\u2019 t see recession, and w e do see positive growth still.  You ask about tariffs.  I would say , tariffs may be a factor in China.  I don\u2019 t think they \u2019re the main factor.  I think the main factors are the de levering campaign that th e government undertook a couple of years ago and also just the longer -term slowing to a more sustainable pace of growth that economies find as they mature.  In terms of our own economy, the level of tariffs is relatively small in the size of our economy \u2014relative to the size of our economy.  We have, since the beginning of the year \u2014and before , really \u2014been hearing from our extensive network of business contacts a lot of concerns about tariffs, concerns about material costs on imported products , and the loss of markets and things like that, depending on which industry , so there \u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty.  It\u2019s hard to say how much of an effect that \u2019s having on our economy.  It\u2019s very hard to tease that apart .  But I will say , it\u2019s been a prominent concern among our business contacts for some time now.

Wells Fargo last week announced that its chief executive received a 5 percent pay raise last year, and this comes among continued settlements by the bank of various consumer abuse and reports that new consumer -unfriendly sales incentives are returning.  Do you have concerns about Wells Fargo \u2019s efforts to fix its problems, and do you expect the asset cap to remai n in place beyond this year?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Wells Fargo.  So what happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns , really , in their risk -management apparatus, which resulted in significant consumer abuses , let\u2019s say.  And as  it\u2019s gone on and on, it \u2019s become clear that\u2014I think some time ago it became clear that these are deep problems that needed to be addressed in a fundamental kind of a way.  So there \u2019s a lot of work to do on that .  And we put in place, really , an unprecedented sanction in the form of an asset growth cap, and we will not lift that until Wells Fargo gets their arms around this, comes forward with plans, implements those plans, and we \u2019re satisfied with what they \u2019ve done.

We don\u2019 t approve individual pay packages.  We do supervise boards of directors for, you know, for having a set of compensation practices that don\u2019 t reward short -term risk -taking and that sort of thing.

I wonder if you could discuss the balance of risks.  I know you said that the outlook among the C ommittee members is a positive one, but since the end o f the meeting, the 3- month\u2013 10-year Treasury spread has fallen to 7 basis  points, and now, according to f ed funds futures trading, there \u2019s a 50 percent chance of a rate cut by next January.  How far off are  the market s?  W hat do you think the risks actually are?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, first, the data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another, in my view.  I would say it this way :  We see a positive outlook for this year, a favorable out look for this year, as I mentioned.  So, in our SEP projections, C ommittee members, participants, generally see growth of around 2 percent.  They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent.  They see inflation remaining close to target.  And they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent.  So, you know, that \u2019s a positive outlook.  It\u2019s a favorable outlook.  We \u2019re also very mindful \u2014and we have been, of course, all along \u2014of what the risks are.  And you see \u2014you mentioned  some of them .  You know , you see slowing global growth.  You still have \u2014there\u2019 s no resolution of Brexit.  There\u2019 s no resolution, really , of the trade talks.  These are ongoing risks.  We \u2019re also carefully monitoring what \u2019s happening with U.S. growth.  We called that out in our st atement.  You know, the limited data that we have do show a slowdown.  On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive.  So that \u2019s really how we\u2019 re thinking about it\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Tankersley, New York Times.   I\u2019m curious, you\u2019re now a full percentage point \u2014actually , more than a percentage point \u2014below the White House in your projections for growth this year.  By my calculations, that \u2019s the largest spread March 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 9 o f 23  we\u2019ve seen since the end of the recession b etween the White House and the F ed.  Why, for one, do you see \u2014do you think you see the economy so differently than they do, and do you worry at all about imp lications for policy from that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I haven \u2019t\u2014I haven \u2019t seen their projection.  I wouldn\u2019 t comment on their projection.  I would take it this way.  You can think of growth as being composed of two things.  And one is really growth in the workforce \u2014more hours worked.  And the other is productivity \u2014it\u2019s output per hour.  You can really think of growth as those two things.  And I \u2019ve been calling \u2014often mentioning  these days that it would be great if we had national -level policies to support higher labor force participation.  The United States is now one of t he lowest countries among the advanced economies , in terms of our labor force participation by prime -age workers.  And that \u2019s a place where we can grow faster.  If we can bring more people into the labor force and give them a chance to contribute to and benefit from our overall prosperity, that will be a great thing for the country.  So  I would like to see that. Productivity is much harder.  It\u2019s v ery difficult to  project productivity over long stretches of time.  It\u2019s a function of evolving technology.  So , I guess I would say, what is the potential growth rate?  It\u2019s quite hard to know with any precision, and I just would like to see us, you know, undertake an ef fort to make it be as  high as it can sustainably be.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  A quick follow -up on that .  Do you see the tax cuts \u2014the 2017 tax cuts as having provided a large boost to labor force  participation as the White House does \n\nCHAIR POWELL: I would say so.  I think it \u2019s clear that the tax and spending policies that were adopted early last year supported demand in a significant way last year.  And it \u2019s also the case, I think, that they should have some supply -side effects.  I think it \u2019s hard to know, it \u2019s hard to identify those with any precision, and we hope they \u2019re\u2014we hope they \u2019re very large.  You March 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 10 o f 23  know, the idea would be that lowering corporate taxes would spur more corporate investment, which would spur more productivity, and lowering individual taxes would spur greater labor force participation.  I wouldn\u2019 t want to be handing \u2014you know, assigning credit  or blame for that, but I do think that the performance of labor force participation over the last , really , three or four years has been an upside surprise that most people didn\u2019 t see coming, and it \u2019s extremely welcome.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Marty Crutsinger  with the Associated Press.

Are they \u2014is that a possibility in your mind , given the sharp change you\u2019 ve made at this meeting?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  As I mentioned, the data that we \u2019re seeing are not currently sending a signal which suggests moving in either direction for me, which is really why we \u2019re being patient.

Does  it concern you, given that the F ed has traditionally been a consensus -                                                 1 Chair Powell intended to say that the unemployment rate is under 4 percent.

And U.S .\u2014the large U.S. financial institutions have made significant progress there and are now much better at the capital planning process .  And for , really , some time now, for a couple of years, we \u2019ve talked about moving supervision of that process \u2014moving to a supervisory approach to that rather than having a pass/fail in the stress tests .  We \u2019ve been talking about that for quite a while .  And I think, given the level that the banks have moved to in capital planning, we did that .  It shouldn\u2019 t be a big surprise \u2014something we \u2019ve been talking a bout doing for a couple of years.  For banks that are newer to CCAR and haven \u2019t made that kind of progress, then they \u2019re still going to be part of \u2014they \u2019re still going to have a qualitative test until they can reach  similar levels of achievement.  In terms of having disparate views, I \u2014look, we try \u2014we are very much a consensus -driven organization.  We try very hard to reach consensus on things.  In the end, it \u2019s very healthy to have disparate v iews and to state them publicly and put them on the record.  It\u2019s nothing but healthy from my standpoint.

And, you know, it was a March 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 12 o f 23  surprise, I would say, and inconsistent with a signif icant amount of other data.  We \u2019re not dismissing it in any way, but I would go back to, what is it that supports consumer spending ?  It\u2019s 70 percent of the economy, as you point out .  It\u2019s strong economic underlying fundamentals , so, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job creation , confidence.  The household confidence surveys have moved back up to where they were last summer.

Chair Powell, in 1998 the Fed eased policy in a way that some say may have avoided a recession, others say may have helped fuel the NASDAQ tech stock bubble .  And financial conditions have eased considerably this year since the policy pivot that you made clear in January .  The S&P, for example, is  just 3 percent below last summer \u2019s peak.

So this is something we have very much on our radar screen.  And I would say , overall , we don \u2019t see financial stability vulnerabilities as high.  There are some aspects of the financial markets that we\u2019 re carefully monitoring, and those are in the March 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 13 o f 23  nature o f things that might b e amplifiers to a downturn\u2014as opposed to a financial stability concern, which might lead to a financial crisis and that kind of thing, which we don\u2019 t see.  So we do monitor that . And I would also say, you know, that the whole question of monetary policy and financial stability is an unsettled and difficult one in our world.  We do think that the principal tools for, you know, for managing financial stability are regulation, supervision, macroprudential tools, and those sorts of things a s opposed to changing the interest rate.

We \u2014in our system, we mainly rely on \u201c through the cycle \u201d tools like high capital and stress tests.  Our financial stability system is built on those tools :  high capital, high liquidity, resolution planning, stress testing.  So those are always on.  We also have some tools, like the countercyclical capital buffer, which we can deploy at times when vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.  But we do rely on those tools.

From our standpoint, the part of it that we can control is that we\u2019ve been involved with supervising our financial institutions that are active either in the United Kingdom or the European Union or both to make sure that they \u2019re ready for the  full range of possible outcomes to the \u2014to Brexit.

And rising \u2014why aren \u2019t risin g wages feeding into inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Let me take wages first, if I can.  So wages have moved up in the last couple of years and are now running at healthier , higher levels, and that \u2019s a good thing .  In fact, a lot of the wage gains have been going to lower -paid workers , as can happen late in the cycle, which is also a good thing.  So \u2014but that \u2019s not price inflation , that\u2019s wage inflation.  Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation.  So what I see is inflation that\u2019 s close to 2 percent but that sort of keeps bumping up against 2 percent and then maybe  moving back down a little bit.  And I don\u2019t feel that  we have kind of convincingly achieved our 2 percent mandate in a symmetrical way.  Now, what do we mean by \u201c symmetrical\u201d ?  What we really mean is that we would look at \u2014we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is  that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as  persistently below the target.  So that \u2019s really our framework .  And I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve quite achieved that yet, because we\u2019re really 10 years deep in this \u2014almost 10 years \u2014in this exp ansion, and inflation is still kind of, I\u2019d say , not, you know, clearly meeting our target.  So that \u2019s one of the reasons why we \u2019re being patient.  I think, as I\u2019ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target\u2014March 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 16 o f 23  particularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for most of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that  core will be too\u2014t hat gives us the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being ac hieved.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: I just wanted to press a little bit about, what is the story the C ommittee \u2014you know, when you get in the discussion today and yesterday about inflation, what kind of is the story that emerges?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So there are a bunch of different stories.  There \u2019s no real easy answer.  One of them is just that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than people think.  That\u2019s one way to think about it, that there\u2019 s still more slack in the economy.  Another is tha t expectations play a very \u2014inflation expectations play a very key role in our framework and other frameworks, and, you know, there is the possibility that some people discuss of expectations being anchored but below 2 percent.

It\u2019s one of the major challenges of our time, really, to have inflation\u2014 you know, downward pressure on inflation, let \u2019s say.  It gives central banks less room to, you know, to respond to downturns, right ?  So if inflation expectations a re below 2 percent, they \u2019re always going to be pulling inflation down, and we\u2019re going to be paddling upstream in  trying to, you know, keep inflation at 2 percent, which gives us some room March 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL   Page 17 o f 23  to cut, you know, when it\u2019 s time to cut rates when the economy weak ens.  And, you know, that \u2019s something that central banks face all over the world, and we certainly face that problem too.  It\u2019s one of the \u2014one of the things we \u2019re looking into as  part of our strategic monetary policy review this year.

They expect solid growth in 2019, but are closely monitoring developments at home and abroad.Given the favorable conditions in the economy, the Federal Reserve will be patient in assessing if any changes in policy are necessary. The data and fiscal stimulus have contributed to strong growth in 2018, but recent data suggests that growth is slowing more than expected, with financial conditions remaining less supportive of growth.The economy showed little signs of slowing down in 2018, but recent data has been more mixed. Job growth has slowed, but remains strong enough to accommodate new labor force entrants. Other labor market indicators remain positive, although business fixed investment is growing at a slower pace. Inflation has been low and policy issues like Brexit and trade negotiations pose risks to the outlook. The discussion at the meeting focused on interpreting the various indicators, and the Summary of Economic Projections reflects individual Committee participants' assessments.The FOMC expects a modest slowdown in overall conditions, in line with other forecasts, with growth at roughly 2 percent and unemployment remaining below 4 percent. Core inflation remains close to 2 percent, while declines in oil prices are expected to temporarily push headline inflation below 2 percent. The federal funds rate is currently in the range of estimates of neutral, and the FOMC believes that the current policy stance is well suited to the outlook, emphasizing the need for patience in assessing any changes.The Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) includes participants' projections of the most likely economic scenario and the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, which serve as inputs for policy discussions. The SEP interest rate projections are not a Committee decision or plan, as the FOMC statement is the device used to express the Committee's opinions on the likely path of rates. Additionally, the Committee released revised Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans, aiming to normalize the balance sheet gradually and transparently to minimize disruption and risks to their dual-mandate objectives.The FOMC has announced their plans to slow the runoff of their assets starting in May and to completely cease the runoff in September of this year. They also mentioned that if necessary, they may hold the size of their asset holdings constant for a period of time before gradually increasing them again based on demand.The Committee plans to address remaining normalization topics, such as the desired maturity composition of their Treasury securities portfolio, as they continue their efforts. They reiterate their intention to primarily hold Treasury securities in their portfolio.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Can you clarify how worried the FOMC is about a steep slowdown and if the runoff of the balance sheet is a form of monetary tightening?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC is positive about the outlook, expecting around 2% growth this year. Economic fundamentals are strong with a strong labor market, rising incomes, low unemployment, and confident surveys. The balance sheet plan is not related to monetary policy, as the FOMC sees the interest rate tool as the principal tool and the balance sheet normalization as a separate process.", "'QUESTION': How are global developments affecting the U.S.? What is causing the weakness in the global economy and how much is it responsible for the downgrade in U.S. GDP? What impact are tariffs having on both the U.S. and global economies?\n\n'ANSWER': The global economy was a tailwind for the U.S. in 2017, but it has since slowed, particularly in Europe and China. Weaker global growth can be a headwind for the U.S. economy, although it is hard to determine the exact impact. Tariffs may be a factor in China, but the main factors are China's deleveraging campaign and the natural slowing of growth. Tariffs have caused concerns among U.S. businesses, but it is difficult to quantify their effect on the economy.", "'QUESTION': Do you have concerns about Wells Fargo's efforts to fix its problems, and do you expect the asset cap to remain in place beyond this year?\n'ANSWER': Wells Fargo experienced widespread breakdowns in risk management, resulting in significant consumer abuses.

Currently, the concerns and asset cap remain in place.", "'QUESTION': Do you believe it's appropriate for the CEO to be getting a pay raise in light of those conditions, in terms of corporate governance?\n'ANSWER': Our main focus is on the company fixing its risk-management approach and rebuilding it.

The Committee sees a positive outlook with around 2% growth, unemployment below 4%, and inflation close to target. However, there are ongoing risks such as slowing global growth, unresolved Brexit and trade talks, and a slowdown in U.S. growth.", "'QUESTION': Why do you see the economy differently than the White House and do you worry about policy implications?\n'ANSWER': I haven't seen their projection, but growth is composed of workforce growth and productivity.

Banks that are newer to CCAR will still have a qualitative test until they reach similar levels of achievement. Disparate views are healthy and the Fed will continue to strive for consensus.", "'QUESTION': What gives you confidence that the slowdown in household and business growth is temporary?\n'ANSWER': The weak retail sales in December were inconsistent with other data, but we believe that consumer spending is supported by strong economic fundamentals such as rising wages, high employment levels, and confidence.

While some aspects of the financial markets are being monitored, overall, the Fed does not see high vulnerabilities in financial stability. The Fed believes that regulation, supervision, and macroprudential tools are the primary tools for managing financial stability, rather than changing interest rates. However, the Fed remains mindful of financial conditions and associated risks.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the Fed needs more macroprudential tools to rely less on monetary policy for asset price appreciation in a lower neutral interest rate world?\n'ANSWER': The Fed primarily relies on \"through the cycle\" tools like high capital and stress tests for financial stability. They also have tools like the countercyclical capital buffer for times of elevated vulnerabilities. Banks are now better capitalized and more aware of risks, making them more resilient in difficult economic conditions.", "'QUESTION': How alarming is the estimate that the nation's debt will reach over $31 trillion by 2029, and when should we start worrying about a possible credit crisis?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell acknowledges that deficits matter and our debt cannot grow faster than our economy indefinitely.

Dealing with the debt is inevitable.", "'QUESTION': How much has the uncertainty of Brexit affected the Fed's approach to monetary policy and what is the estimated size of the balance sheet at the end of September?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is closely monitoring Brexit and ensuring that financial institutions are prepared for various outcomes.

Inflation has been close to 2 percent but has not consistently met our target. We are being patient because we have not achieved our target goals yet, although we expect headline inflation to be below target due to lower oil prices.", "'QUESTION': What is the story that emerges from the discussion about inflation?\n'ANSWER': The story is complex and there are multiple factors at play. One possibility is that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than expected, indicating more slack in the economy. Another factor is the role of inflation expectations, which may be anchored below 2 percent. Overall, inflation has remained slightly below 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': What challenges does below-target inflation pose to policymakers and the global economy?\n'ANSWER': Below-target inflation is a major challenge as it limits central banks' ability to respond to downturns. If inflation expectations are below 2 percent, it constantly pulls inflation down, making it difficult to maintain a 2 percent target. This is a global issue and central banks are exploring creative ways to uphold the credibility of their inflation targets.", "'QUESTION': What conditions do you need to see in order for a rate cut or a rate hike?\n'ANSWER': We acknowledged the downgrades in the statement, but we have a positive outlook for the year due to solid economic fundamentals. Currently, there is no data suggesting a need to move in either direction, so we will remain patient and act appropriately when the time comes.", "'QUESTION': Would you be in favor of allowing wage growth to continue accelerating without matching that with higher interest rates?\n'ANSWER': We have seen a significant increase in wages and compensation in recent years, which does not trouble me in terms of inflation. In previous cycles, we have seen unit labor costs rise above inflation without leading to price inflation. While it can squeeze corporate margins, I do not see the current wage picture as concerning in terms of inflation.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve account for the financial stability consequences of varying interest rates relative to wage growth?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve focuses on its mandate of price inflation and maximum employment when setting interest rates. It also closely monitors financial stability across all asset categories, but does not specifically tie it to the relationship between interest rates and wage growth.", "'QUESTION': Can you be more specific about how you are preparing U.S. financial institutions for Brexit and how you are addressing potential pressures on the U.S. dollar?\n'ANSWER': We ensure that large financial institutions undergo stress tests every year, subjecting them to significant financial shocks and market changes. They are required to maintain adequate capital and liquidity even after these tests. While this has prepared our institutions well, the unprecedented nature of Brexit makes it difficult to be fully confident, so we are closely monitoring the situation.", "'QUESTION': And as far as the dollar goes?\n'ANSWER': The dollar is the responsibility of the Treasury Department, and while it affects our models, we do not actively seek to directly influence the dollar with our policies.", "'QUESTION': Did the Fed anticipate that the proposal for enhanced prudential standards for banks above $250 billion would encourage consolidation among banks, and does the Fed have any concerns about bank consolidation in general?\n\n'ANSWER': The Fed is not motivated by a specific view of industry structure and wants banks of all sizes and business models to function in the economy. When banks merge and become larger, they face stronger regulation. The Fed's tailoring policy ensures that expectations are tailored to the risks presented by each institution.", "QUESTION: Is the Fed intentionally trying to flatten the yield curve with its bond portfolio strategy, and is this part of its long-term balance sheet strategy? Are there concerns about a flatter or inverted yield curve signaling a recession?\n\nANSWER: No, the Fed has not made a decision on the maturity composition of its balance sheet in the longer run. They have not had serious discussions on this yet, but it is a consequential decision that will require careful thought. They will address it soon but will not rush to resolve it.", "'QUESTION': How do you account for the fact that the average maturity has been lengthening and contributing to a flattening of the yield curve?\n\n'ANSWER': As securities roll off, we invest in similar securities with the same maturity, which automatically lengthens the average maturity. It is not a deliberate plan to lengthen the balance sheet, but rather a practice we adhere to for transparency and consistency, with no policy message intended.", "QUESTION: At what point do you expect to begin to allow the balance sheet to grow slowly again? What are\u00e2\u0080\u0094how will you make that decision?\nANSWER: The balance sheet runoff will stop at September 30. If we still believe that our balance sheet is not sufficient for conducting monetary policy effectively, we will hold it constant. Over time, currency and nonreserved liabilities will grow and reserves will shrink. We don't know how long this will continue, as reserve demand is uncertain.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about the market impact if the Fed tightens policy in the future?\n'ANSWER': We are currently in a good place, being patient and watching the data. We don't see any reason to move rates in either direction at the moment. We will continue to monitor events and act accordingly when there is clarity."]}
