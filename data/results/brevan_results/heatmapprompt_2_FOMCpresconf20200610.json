Thanks, Chair Powell.   Nick Timiraos at t he Wall Street Journal .  I want to ask about the economic projections, and I realize these are more of an educated guess at this point, but they suggest the  Committee sees quite a large output gap o ver the next two years.  And yet the  Committee did not take any steps to date to\u2014to reinforce your forward guidance.  And so my questions are , first, what are you hoping to learn by waiting?  Second, how might that change your response?   And, third, how cl ose is the Committee to reaching a decision on a \u2014a more concrete forward guidance and whether yield caps might reinforce that guidance?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, first, I would say that we think that monetary policy today is currently well positioned to support t he economy in this challenging time.  If we didn\u2019 t think that, of course, we would change our policy now.  As you know, we \u2014we lowered our policy rate   very quickly, [more] quickly than others, to the effective lower bound.  And we \u2019ve said that we\u2019ll keep it  there until the economy has weathered the effects of the virus and is on track to achieve our goals.   You can see that in \u2014in the dot plot, as I think you pointed out, that overwhelmingly, FOMC participants expect, as their baseline expectation, no rate increase at least through 2022.  And if you look at surveys of more forecasters and market participants, financial market prices, et  cetera, those also appropriately reflect a long spell with rates at the effective lower bound. So the first thing is, monetar y policy is in a good place , and it \u2019s\u2014that \u2019s well understood in the markets.   Secondly, we \u2019ve also taken strong measures to support the flow of credit in the economy, as I mentioned.  And , third, we \u2019re continuing asset prices in coming months at \u2014at a \u2014at a relatively high level.1  So for all those reasons, we feel like policy is now in a good place.  So as we look ahead, we see that the path for the \u2014ahead for the economy is highly uncertain and continues to depend to a really significant degree on the path of the pandemic.  So, at this meeting, what we did was, as I mentioned, we \u2014we looked in some depth at forward guidance and asset purchases and looked carefully at those.   We also received a briefing on the historical experience with yield curve control.  And  we\u2019ll continue those discussions in upcoming meetings and evaluate our stance and communications as more and portion \u2014more \u2014more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available.   I\u2014I would just say, in terms of \u2014of what we \u2019re looking for, we \u2014we expect to get a better understanding of the economy\u2019 s trajectory  and, particularly , how we should best deploy those tools to achieve those goals.  So that \u2019s really what we \u2019re looking to achieve , and, as you can see, we \u2019re\u2014we \u2019re actively at work on that.                                                   1 Chair Powell intended to say \u201casset purchases\u201d rather than \u201casset prices.\u201d  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.   Thank you so much for taking our question s.  I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m curious about your inflation forecast s, which are \u2014are pretty low across the forecast horizon.  I guess just given how low you see inflation being over the coming years, why is policy appropriate now , and why not just kind of throw everything you can\u2014you know, everything and the kitchen sink at it currently?   And I guess if you could just talk a little bit about what urgency you see in \u2014in returning it back to that 2  percent  target.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Our current policy stance is appropriate.  And remember, we \u2019re using\u2014we \u2019re using our \u2014our emergency 13(3) lending tools to an unprecedented extent.  We have asset purchases, and we \u2019ve now said that we won\u2019 t go any lower than this , and\u2014but \u2014but  that we \u2019re prepared to adjust as appropriate, and rates are at the effective lower bound.   So we have all of our tools in\u2014 in use in a strong way.  And so what we \u2019re\u2014what we \u2019re waiting for is to\u2014is to learn more.   I\u2014I think, actually, if you look at the May employment report, it \u2019s a pretty good\u2014probably the biggest data surprise that anybody can remember.  It \u2019s a pretty good illustration of just how uncertain these times are.   The economy is reopeni ng.  We\u2019re going to learn a whole lot about the \u2014the path of the economy in the next \u2014in coming months .  So that \u2019s really what we\u2019 re\u2014what we \u2019re looking for. In terms of inflation, you \u2019ll know that we \u2014we had a 128- month expansion , and we never did quite get inflation back to 2 percent  on a symmetric, sustained basis.  We got close for the last couple of years, but we never did quite get there.  So I think we have to be humble about our ability to move inflation up and particularly when unemployment is \u2014is going to be above most estimates of the natural rate for \u2014certainly above the median in our \u2014in our \u2014in our SEP well through the end of \u2014past the end of 2022.  So I do\u2014I think we \u2019re in the right place now .  We\u2014  we are looking carefully a t what the \u2014as we learn more and \u2014and better understand the \u2014the path of the economy, we will be assessing, what \u2019s the best way to deploy all of our tools to achieve our goals in the best possible way ? And I \u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll just say again that we are \u2014the \u2014the May empl oyment report, of course, was a\u2014was a welcome surprise, very pleased.   We hope we get many more like it .  But I think we have to be honest .  It\u2019s a\u2014it \u2019s a long road.  I t\u2019s\u2014it\u2019 s, depending on how you count it, well more than 20 million people displaced in the labor market .  It\u2019s going to take some time .  And we are going to be deploying our tools \u2014all of our tools , to their full extent, in pursuit of that \u2014of those goals, however long it takes.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I understand how the  Fed might react in the event things come out worse than expected.   I think I don\u2019 t understand how you might react if things come out better than expected \u2014kind of a variant on these other questions.  How firm is the commitment to lower interest rates?   And if things end up better, do you stick with these low interest rates, as you \u2014as you projected them?   And \u2014or is it specific points that  you have in mind\u2014 for example, unemployment or inflation \u2014that is animating where you might  go?  And what are those numbers that you\u2019 re looking for that might cause you to change about the policy as it now is projected\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I would start with \u2014tha t\u2019s where I would start.  I would say, you know, we were \u2014we just had a period of unemployment, as you know, that was in the \u2014well below 4 percent , hanging around 3\u00bd  percent , that lasted two years.   And during that period of time, we  saw a lot of great things happening in the labor market, things that we \u2019d love to get back to.  We didn\u2019 t see any problems with price inflation.  P rice inflation didn\u2019 t really  react   much.  So, I would say, you know, we \u2019d be looking to get inflation back up, and we \u2014we \u2019d be prepared to tolerate pretty low \u2014welcome, in fact, not tolerate but welcome very low readings on\u2014on unemployment just based on what we \u2014what we saw in the last \u2014in the last expansion.  So, you know , we\u2019re\u2014we \u2019re not thinking about raising rates.   We\u2019re not even t hinking about thinking about raising rates.  So what we \u2019re thinking about is \u2014is providing support for this economy.  We do think this is going to take some time.  I think most forecasters believe that.   It would be great if \u2014if we got a whole bunch more months of job creation like that .  Not\u2014notwithstanding that, as I mentioned, there are \u2014there are just a lot of people that are unemployed .  And it seems quite likely that there will be a significant group at the end of \u2014even \u2014even after a lot of strong job growth, that \u2019ll still be struggling to find jobs, and we \u2019ll still be providing strong accommodation for that.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks very much, Chair Powell.  There have been plenty of comparisons with the Great Dep ression of the 1930s since the crisis began.   I mean , is that scenario sort of got [ten] more dire as data comes out and we \u2019re looking at a more traditional and sudden recession?   And are you at all concerned that the performance \u2014the strong performance in the stock market in the last few weeks is disconnected from economic reality\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I don\u2019t think that the \u2014that the Great Depression is a good example or a likely outcome or a model for what \u2019s happening here at all .  I really don \u2019t.  And there \u2014ther e are just so many fundamental differences.   First, the government response has been so fast and so forceful .  The origin was quite different.   This was a very \u2014an economy that was in a healthy place.   Of course, every economy has longer -run challenges, not \u2014and that \u2014that includes our economy, notwithstanding that 50 -year low in unemployment and the longest expansion in our   history and every reason to think it could continue.  So that \u2019s different from what was happening around the time of the Great \u2014the Dep ression started.   The financial system this time was in \u2014was in \u2014was in very good shape, much better capitalized.  So, you know, it \u2019s just not the right model. I would say,  we\u2019re learning .  You know, every month that passes, we \u2019re seeing more, we\u2019re learning  more.   And I think particularly the next few months will be very important in learning what the \u2014what the real story will be, because we\u2019 ll see the\u2014 the significant incoming data about the opening of the economy\u2014the reopening of the economy.  You know \u2014and I  would say, assuming that the \u2014that the \u2014that the disease remains or becomes pretty much under control, I think that what you see is a \u2014is a very weak second quarter, historically weak, and then an\u2014an expansion that builds momentum over time.  People will adju st, probably a little bit gradually , to some of the activities that would \u2014that involve getting together in small \u2014in large groups in close quarters .  Those will be the harder parts of the economy to recover .  But, ultimately , we do see a full recovery over time.  And that \u2019s really what , you know, what I think I \u2019m\u2014I\u2019m personally seeing.  And you could see significant job growth in \u2014in coming months as people return to their jobs, but you\u2019 re still going to face probably an extended period where it will be difficult for many people to find work.  A nd for\u2014and that \u2019s what you see in \u2014in\u2014in, really , many, many forecasts at this point.   That doesn\u2019 t mean it \u2019s right, but that\u2019 s sort of a \u2014a broad expectation, certainly not the Depression forecast.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi.  Thank you for taking our questions.  Well, in the projections you have \u2014you didn\u2019 t change the \u2014the Fed policymakers didn\u2019 t change their \u2014the forecast for long- run unemployment, so that suggests that you \u2014you know, the \u2014that all of you   so far don\u2019 t see necessarily prospects for long -term damage.  But still, what kind of data are you looking at here to gauge , you know, the potential for longer -term hits to the economy even as we have some of these\u2014even as we have something like the May jobs report , you could still ha ve, at the same time, people return from temporary layoff s, there could still be permanent job losses?   So what kind of data are you looking at to gauge that potential impact , and what is \u2014what is it telling us so far?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Chris, t his is a really important risk.  And I think it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019 s not the risk for the next few months, but it \u2019s the risk over time of \u2014of lasting damage to the \u2014to these \u2014you know, to the productive capacity of the United States , typically in two forms .  One, through extended periods of unemployment, people lose contact with the labor force .  They get out of touch with the skills and \u2014that they need, and\u2014 and they hav e a hard time getting back in, and that drive s that\u2014that , you know, it \u2019s very damaging to people \u2019s lives and their working lives .  And it also just lowers , in a way \u2014it can \u2014it can increase the \u2014you know, the unemployment rate, but it can also lower the labor force participation rate, which is almost worse, in a way, to have people dropping out of the labor force where we need them in the \u2014in the labor force working. The other piece of it is just businesses.   You know, a shock like this that just comes in, it\u2019s like a natural disaster.   You wouldn\u2019 t want a lot of perfectly good businesses, particularly the smaller and medium -sized  businesses that may not have a lot of resources to sustain them to\u2014you know, to go out of business permanently in a situation like that \u2014like this where , really, there was no reason for it.  Of course, you know, businesses are going to go in and out .  They\u2019re going to fail all the time, and that \u2019s a healthy thing in capitalism .  That\u2019s something that has to   happen.  B ut this is different .  This is a way\u2014potentially \u2014so those are the things we \u2019ve been worried about. We didn\u2019 t change .  You\u2014you\u2019 re right, though.  We didn\u2019 t change our longer -run estimate of \u2014of potential growth or of the unemployment rate .  And that \u2019s\u2014I would say, in my thinking, the reason I didn\u2019 t change mine is that I still\u2014 I\u2014I think we can avoid that or avoid much of that, most of that even.  A nd\u2014and we do that with measures that \u2014that , you know, keep people in their homes ; that\u2014that support hiring ; that support growth;  that avoid unnecessary , avoidable business insolvencies.  A nd that \u2019s all the things that we \u2019re trying to do.   Basically, if you look at what \u2019s happened, as I mentioned, there \u2019s something\u2014somewhere short of 25 million people have been displaced, even afte r the good May employment report.   What we \u2019re trying to do is create an environment in which they have the best chance either to go back to their old job or to get a new job.  T hat\u2019s\u2014that \u2019s kind of the most important part of this exercise.  And maybe these \u2014it\u2019s probably hopeful at this point to say that \u2014that we won \u2019t have longer -run damage to the economy, and these numbers won\u2019 t change.  So \u2014but I think it\u2019 s way too early to be \u2014to be changing the longer run\u2014 see, these are\u2014these are not meant to be short -run numbers .  They\u2019re called \u2014they\u2019 re longer -run assessments, so I \u2014I would \u2014I have not changed mine, and I \u2019m hopeful that \u2014that I won \u2019t have to change it \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell.  I \u2019m struggling with two t hings that I hope  you can provide some clarity on.  The first is the ongoing bond buying program .  You say that it \u2019s needed to continue the smooth functioning of markets, but I guess most of us are n\u2019t really seeing  a lot of  instability in markets right now.   So if you could kind of give us some clarity of what you\u2019 re seeing that needs to continue to be smooth at that level and that pace.    Second is, you know, you were just talking about  Fed concerns about small and medium -sized companies going out of bus iness during this .  And , I guess, you know, the Main Street Lending Program still isn \u2019t running yet .  When do you expect loans to start happening ?  And do you think the two -month delay has \u2014has hurt the chances of some companies surviving\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  There have been gains in market function, although not fully back to where you would say they were, for example, in\u2014in February, before the pandemic arrived.  We don\u2019t take those gains for granted , though.  This is a \u2014this is a highly fluid situation , and we \u2019re\u2014we\u2019re not taking those for granted.  And, in addition, as I pointed out in my\u2014in my statement, those purchases are clearly also supporting highly accommodative \u2014or accommodative financial conditions, and that \u2019s\u2014that \u2019s a good thing, so that \u2019s why we \u2019re doing that. Turning quickly to Main S treet, s o I would say that t he thing \u2014what we \u2019ve done on Main Street, I think to a greater degree, is , we\u2019ve listened to feedback.  So we \u2019ve been out repeatedly for feedback in trying to create a \u2014a much more difficult pr oduct than, really , the other facilities.   And I think this \u2014this last set of changes we made have actually been very positive for the facility.   I think it \u2019s going to be better able to achieve its goals, and, you know, so we \u2019ve used the time well, I think.  And that \u2014we are now in the \u2014in the \u2014in the final run -up to starting the facility.   What we did, as you saw earlier \u2014I guess it \u2019s early this week or late , whenever we did it in the last few days\u2014was we lowered the minimum loan size and we increased the maximu m loan size.   But , I think, even more importantly, we lengthened the maturity and we stretched out the repayment schedule significantly.  So borrowers will get a \u2014a two -year delay until they have to make any principal payments \u2014repayments and a one -year dela y on interest.  So we had been hearing from   both borrowers and lenders that these would be very helpful.   We made the changes.  We\u2019re putting them through the facility.  The next step will be to register lenders.  At that time, loans can begin to be made.  Shortly after that, the facility itself will be up, and those facilities can be \u2014those loans can be sold\u201495 percent  of the loans .  And it\u2019s 95 percent across the board now in the Main S treet facility can be sold.   So all of that should happen quickly now.  And I do think this has \u2014this has been a challenging project, but I think we \u2019ve come to a\u2014to a better place.   And , by the way, we\u2019re\u2014we \u2019re going to be prepared to adapt further, if we need to.  A nd\u2014and that \u2019s true of all of our facilities.   These are uniqu e.  There\u2019s no\u2014 there \u2019s no playbook here.  You\u2014you have to draw this up and then try it out.  And we \u2019ve\u2014we \u2019ve been, you know, very willing to adapt and will continue to be\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hello, Chai r Powell.   This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News .  I wanted to ask you about regulatory forbearance.  There were some piecemeal forbearance measures put into place in various jurisdictions and also to a slice of the mortgage market to prevent banks from forecl osing on such debts amid the widespread financial hardships caused by the pandemic .  And with many of those set to expire soon and many businesses and households still in dire financial straits, I \u2019m wondering if any consideration is being given at the  Fed to more comprehensive regulatory forbearance measures or other regulatory measures to prevent businesses from going under just because they can \u2019t meet those payments.  There have, of course , been some tweaks to the Paycheck Protection P rogram on the fiscal side to address this, but I wanted to ask you about things you might be able to do on the regulatory side as well.  Thank you. \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  We can\u2014we can make changes to bank regulation and supervision.  I don\u2019 t know that we have the ability to make cha nges, for example, in mortgage payments, if that\u2019s what you\u2019 re thinking of, or credit card payments .  That\u2019s really \u2014that\u2019s something that could be legislative, or it could just be what the \u2014what the banks themselves are doing.   There \u2019s been a tremendous amount of forbearance on the part of the banks, and I guess our role there would be to encourage it, but those are not decisions that we hold any legal authority to make, and we \u2014by the way, we have encouraged those decis ions.  I hope that \u2019s responsive to your question. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I know you\u2019 re loathe to weigh in too heavily on fiscal policy, but given your forecast for elevated unemployment rates, do you think it\u2019s important that Congress extend the $600 a week extra unemployment benefits?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I think we try to keep our comments on fiscal policy at a high level, and I \u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll come to your specific question, but I would just say this :  This is the biggest economic shock in the U.S. and in the world, really, in living memory.  We went from the lowest level of employ\u2014unemployment in 50 years to the highest level in close to 90 years, and we did it in two months .  Extraordinary.  And , appropriately, the response from fiscal authorities has been large, forceful, and very quick by\u2014by the standards of these things.  Roughly $3 trillion Congress has authorized, and that \u2019s benefiting households ; laid-off workers ; small, medium, and large businesses;  hospitals ; state and local gove rnments \u201414 percent  of GDP .  It is\u2014it\u2019 s in a class by itself, in terms of both the size and the speed of it, and it \u2019s also pretty innovative.  You know, the \u2014both the PPP and the unemployment insurance are quite innovative in the American context, and there w ere difficulties in implementing it, but that \u2019s really a function   of\u2014of their novelty, I think.  Those programs \u2014by the way, let me add:  T he Fed also \u2014we both innovated and acted forcefully, progressively, proactively, and aggressively as well.   If you put those together, all of that is making a difference now.   You look at the income data .  The expanded unemployment insurance and also the stimulus checks have gone a long way to replacing lost income from \u2014from job loss.  I think you\u2019 re seeing it in the job market data .  Many are giving the PPP credit on that front and \u2014and in keeping small businesses going.  So it \u2019s\u2014so far, it\u2019 s a good response , and it \u2019s having\u2014it \u2019s having a big effect.  You \u2014you get to\u2014 the question is, it \u2019s big\u2014 everyone can see tha t it\u2019s big.  Is it going to be big enough?   And that \u2014that is the question .  And\u2014and the question for \u2014for \u2014the question that I \u2019ve been concerned about, really, is this issue of longer -run damag e to the economy.  We\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re \u2014we \u2019re doing a fair job of getting through these first few months , more than a fair job.   The question, though, is, that group of people who won\u2019 t be able to go back to work quickly, what about them?   And that could be many millions of people, you know , parts \u2014who worked in parts of the ec onomy that will be the slow  ones  to recover.   And , you know, we want those people back in the labor force .  We want them getting jobs .  So\u2014and\u2014and they\u2019 re going to need possibly\u2014 probably will need further support.  So I  will just say this :  It\u2019s possible that we will need to do more, and it \u2019s possible that Congress will need to do more. In terms of the $600 unemployment insurance, I wouldn\u2019 t\u2014I wouldn\u2019 t try to give Congress advice on the specifics of that.  I \u2014I know they\u2019 re looking at \u2014I mean, I \u2014I know from both talking to people and\u2014and reading the papers that they \u2019re looking at a whole bunch of different possible approaches going forward, and some of those seem kind of promising.  So, you know, we \u2019re happy to give advice if people ask for it but \u2014but probably not\u2014not publicly.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Chair Powell.  I \u2019m going to pick up on what Scott Horsley was asking just a moment ago.   You have been studious about threading this needle in the interviews that you\u2019 ve giv en and speeches and the\u2014the colloquy that \u2019s followed, not giving advice to Congress but indicating that there \u2019s likely to be a need for more fiscal stimulus or additional policy in the future .  So I\u2019m going to try a hypothetical here, and you can rebuff it  if\u2014if you want. But if you were to find yourself in a \u2014in a senator \u2019s office suite, and he held up that May unemployment report, which you\u2019 ve described as unexpectedly positive and \u2014and a welcome surprise, and if he or she said to you, \u201cLook, this is an indication that we can put on the breaks, \u201d I wonder what you would say.  Your \u2014your message throughout this crisis has been one of how unprecedented it is, about how much urgency there is in dealing with this .  Indeed, we \u2019ve seen that from the Federal Reserve.   I wonder if you worry that that sense of urgency isn \u2019t being matched and \u2014and what the consequences of that might be, if there \u2019s a fear that the  Fed could be seen as a Cassandra here as we look at that unemployment report and then through the summer, and you have more and more politicians inclined just to wait and see what happens here in\u2014 in subsequent reports.  And a quick second question, if I could .  You\u2019ve talked a lot about your fear of  a second wave of this disease, and it strikes me, there\u2019 s a\u2014a difficulty here with definition.  You\u2019ve talked about us weathering this crisis and getting through this storm .  It seems to me, as I listen to the chatter coming from the White House and from politicians and epidemiologists, there isn\u2019 t agreement on what \u201c getting through this \u201d means.  A nd you have an A dministration now inclined to, if not direct, be content with states opening up their economies perhaps too early.  How   problematic is that from a policy perspective, not having agreement on what it means to have  defeated this virus or gotten to a place where the economy can get through this \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I can\u2019t offer any advice, b ut I will provide a little context for the \u2014for\u2014I want to be clear about the picture \u2014one way to look at the picture, really, and that  is this :  You can\u2014you can get at this by looking at , you know, the \u2014the \u2014the widest measure of unemployment, of labor market slack, if you will, is the U -6 measure.   And the U \u2014that \u2019s the\u2014the one we look\u2014talk about all the time is called U -3, by economists .  And the \u2014the one that has a much broader measurement of slack in the economy is U -6.  So in \u2014in\u2014in U -6, the U -6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent  to 21  percent .  That\u2014that amounts to 22 million additional people who are \u2014who \u2019ve\u2014who \u2019ve lost wor k in the economy either by going to part time or something like that .  So that \u2019s in the low 20s, and that \u2019s post the May employment report.  You can get at it a different way .  You can look at \u2014at just the regular unemployment rate.  You can take the 21  [million] \u2014people  who have \u2014ha d\u2014are listed  as unemployed right  now.  You can add more on for the ones who were miscoded.  Y ou can also take those people who are suddenly out of the labor force .  You put those together, a nd that has gone up by about 24 million .  So those are two different measures of what \u2019s happened.  So the question is, 20, 22, 24 million people \u2014got to get them back to work.   Somehow, we \u2019ve got to all, as a country, get those people back to work.  They didn\u2019 t do anything wrong;  this was a natural  disaster, and I \u2014I really \u2014I do think the response s so far have been great .  So that \u2019s the way I would think about it.  And if \u2014if you think we \u2014I would just , in terms of the May employment report, it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019 s so nice to see.   I mean, I think what  people were thinking was that you \u2019d start to get those back -to-work kind of numbers in June and July and August .  Very few people saw them in May.   I mean, almost no one saw that happening as early as mid -May, but it did.  And so, you know, and   we\u2014we don\u2019 t know fully what that means, whether it \u2019s just a timing change or whether it will prove to be much more than that .  We\u2019ll\u2014we \u2019re going to have to wait and see.  It is a \u2014as I mentioned earlier, it is clear evidence of just how uncertain things are, and \u2014and how humble we have to be about our ability to\u2014 to really have confident predictions as opposed to just predictions.  So, bottom line, I would just say, that \u2014that \u2014the key thing people need to understand is that there \u2019s just a lot of work to do in the labor ma rket.  We\u2019re going to stic k with this and support that  until the work is done .  That you\u2014you can\u2014that is something we \u2019re going to do with all of our tools, and I think it may require Congress to help as well.  It may, but that \u2019s going to be their decision.  On\u2014you also asked about the second wave.  So  we\u2014you know, we have major responsibilities and powerful tools, but the decision about when to reopen the economy is one for elected officials at the state and local and federal level .  And, you know, if they a sk, we \u2014we don\u2019t have any pa rticular expertise here at the F ed in pandemics or coronaviruses or anything like that.   We talk to experts, but \u2014you know , so we don\u2019 t have anything special to add on that.  I would just say, it \u2019s\u2014you know, it \u2019s kind of self  evident, I think, that if a \u2014if it happens , you know, the \u2014the issue would be, first of all, people \u2019s health , but secondly, you could see a public loss of confidence in\u2014 in parts of the economy that will be already slow to recover .  So it could hurt the recovery even if you don\u2019 t have a national -level  pandemic, just a \u2014just a series of \u2014of local ones, of local spikes could \u2014could have the effect of undermining people \u2019s confidence in traveling, in restaurants and entertainment, anything that involves getting people together in small groups and feeding them or flying them around\u2014those things could be hurt.  So it would not be a positive development, and I \u2019ll just leave it at that.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Chairman Powell, for the question.  On Main Street l ending facilities, you know, in May we saw 55 \u2014at least 55 companies file for bankruptcy.  Do you think that it is too late , first of all?   Second of all, the future of these facilities \u2014is this a one -year impact to  the economy through these facilities, or is this a multiple -year?   If so, how many years?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  We have , you know, significant interest, we think.  And also, remember, lots and lots of companies are getting financed, too.  The \u2014the banks are lendi ng.  The markets are open .  You know, you have a \u2014a\u2014a much better lending climate than \u2014than certainly than we had in February and March.  W e don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s too late, though.  We \u2014we \u2014and we do expect it to be up quite soon. In terms of the timing of these things, so, you know, we \u2019ll leave them open as \u2014we \u2019ll leave them open for new loans as long as they need to.  T hat\u2019ll be a decision we make, of course, with our colleagues at the Treasury Department .  And, at a certain point, there won \u2019t be a need for furth er loans, and\u2014 and then the assets will \u2014will be there.   And so if that \u2019s\u2014I don\u2019 t know if that\u2019s a part of your question too, but I would just say that , at that point , you know, the \u2014the  useful role of the \u2014of the Federal Reserve is probably close t o an end at  that point.  We don\u2019 t have any expertise in managing pools of credit assets, loans \u2014if you will \u2014or bonds, and we , you know, we don\u2019 t want to be made \u2014we don\u2019 t really want to be part of the decisions th at have to be made to manage such a portfolio, so we \u2019d be looking to have that done either someplace else or , you know, by\u2014by a third party or at the Treasury Department or something.  And we \u2019re, you know, we \u2019re working on ideas for that.  But our real focus now is   on\u2014is getting these facilities going and \u2014and ge tting them to do the job that they\u2014 they need to do\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Chair.  So I have two quick questions.  One is if we have hit bottom for  the economy, and the second question is regarding the \u2014the way that the pandemic has exacerbated racial inequality.   I wanted to ask, to what extent do you think you can factor in both disparities when you\u2019 re thinking a bout maximum employment \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I would say that many forecasters had been expectin g a bottom for the economy in\u2014around the middle of the year, with\u2014with a huge range of uncertainty.  I think the labor market\u2014 the evidence of one jobs  report is that the labor market may have hit bottom in May.   We don \u2019t know that ; we\u2019re going to see.  And , you know, many forecasters widely expect a\u2014a recovery over the second half of the year .  So it\u2014it is possible, but the thing is, we \u2019re not going to overreact to a single data point.  We \u2019re going to be very careful about reaching any conclusions about \u2014about good data or bad data .  So, I think , you know, we \u2019re going to be here with our tools supporting this economy for as long as it \u2019s needed.  So \u2014but I think there \u2019s a possibility that \u2014that the bottom has come in the labor market, but we don\u2019 t know that yet.   We\u2019ll\u2014we \u2019ll know more as we go forward.  So, in terms of the \u2014you know, the effect of the pandemic on inequality, what you see \u2014 the pandemic, of course, hits everybody, but in an economic sense, it hits those industries that are\u2014that involve groups of people in tight groups, either in places where they\u2019 re\u2014it\u2019 s the travel, leisure, restaurant, bars, those kinds of service -economy jobs.  And so a lot of the lost jobs were from people who work in the service economy, dealing with the public, for example, and relatively \u2014compared to other jobs, relatively low wages.  So, and if \u2014if you just look at what   that is, unemployment has gone up more for Hispanics, more for African Americans .  And women have borne \u2014borne an extraordinary\u2014 a notable share of the burden beyond their percentage in the workforce.  So that \u2019s really \u2014really,  really unfortunate, because if you just go back two months, where we were was, we had, effectively, the first tight labor market in a quarter -century.  A nd for the last couple of years before the pandemic hit, you were seeing wages go up the most for people at the lower end of the wage spectrum, and that was great.   And , you know, we were meeting with people from low - and\u2014low - and moderate -income  communities  all over the country and hearing, \u201cD on\u2019t change this .  Do whatever  you\u2014do whatever you can.   Keep this going.  T his is the best labor market we \u2019ve seen. \u201d And we had every expect \u2014every expectation, every reason to expect that this would continue, and then this comes.   So it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s heartbreaking, and, you know, we want to get it back, so\u2014we really want to get it back.  And so I think we learned a number of things over the course of the last few years .  One of them is that , you know, I \u2014you\u2014you can have 3, 3\u00bd percent  unemployment for a couple of years, and , really, you see modest moves in wages and relatively almost invisible moves in inflation.   So that was not anybody\u2019 s understanding of the structure of the economy, I think, or most peoples \u2019, anyway.  So we can use our tools to \u2014to support the labor market and support the economy.  We can\u2014we can use them until we do fully recover, and that \u2014that\u2019s what we \u2019re planning to do.  You know, we don\u2019 t target different groups .  What\u2014what we are\u2014we are cognizant of t he fact , though, that late in the last cycle, late in the last expansion, the benefits really do go more to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum for \u2014for the first time in many years when labor   markets are tight, when unemployment is low .  And so we  would really like to get back to that \u2014get back to that place.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, I\u2019m Victoria Guida with Politico.   I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things that are \u2014have already been asked.  First of all, on fiscal policy, you all obviously put out your Summary of E conomic P rojections today , and I \u2019m curious to what extent future fiscal policy is factored in or not factored in to those projections, and\u2014and how, more or less, fiscal policy might affect those projections .  And then my other question is on \u2014on Main Street.  Y ou\u2019ve mentioned multiple times that , you know, the  Fed and T reasury are willing to expand the program further.  So my question is, what \u2019s the threshold for those types of changes?  Is it just making sure that borrowers that want to borrow through the program are \u2014are \u2014are able to do that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: In terms of the  way\u2014the way we do forecasts is, we \u2014we don\u2019 t\u2014the\u2014we don\u2019 t tend to incorporate things we \u2019re highly uncertain about.  So I thin k the \u2014the forecast would not have included substantial additional \u2014you know, big additional fiscal support for the economy.  M aybe \u2014maybe a modest amount, something that looks like a \u2014a low -end guess on what might come out of the current negotiations .  That\u2019s basically what would be in the baseline.   So, of course, if there were more fiscal support, you\u2019 d see\u2014you\u2019 d see better results sooner, but that \u2019s a question for Congress.  You know, we \u2019re\u2014we \u2019re spending a lot , and that \u2019s really what they get to decide.  In terms of Main S treet and our willingness to expand it further, I think we \u2019re\u2014one thing we\u2019re looking at \u2014very strongly looking at is \u2014is nonprofits, and is there a way to\u2014to incorporate them into\u2014into  that facility or a similar facility .  So that \u2019s another dimension.  I \u2014  you know, if we  had a great idea for changing Main S treet, we would\u2019 ve done it .  And we \u2014and we have done some things that I think are really very positive lately here.  But if we \u2014as we learn more, it could be \u2014it could be in terms of size, it could be in terms of lots of different things.  But I \u2014I think we have a good product to go to market with now , and I think it \u2019ll get \u2014it\u2019ll get out there soon.  A nd, you know, we \u2019ll see, and \u2014and we \u2019ll be willing to continue to adapt.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Chair Powell , as you know, the vast majority of people who have been laid off are expecting to be recalled by their employers.   At this point, what is your expectation of how much of these job losses will be permanent?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I don\u2019t have a reliable estimate o f that.   Clearly, not everyone will go back.  But \u2014and I \u2014I would say, many will go back, but what \u2019s\u2014what \u2019s going to be the remainder when \u2014you know, when we reach sort of what is the new normal?   It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s so uncer tain, but it \u2014it could be a good number of millions of people, I think, in many \u2014in many estimates, b ut these \u2014I\u2019d say you\u2019 re so early in the process.  People are \u2014for example, people are going back and looking at other significant changes in the economy, and they\u2019 ve seen how many people go back when, for example, there \u2019s a technological change, and things like that \u2014you may have seen some of this research \u2014and you come up with an estimate .  I\u2014you know, it \u2019s just going to be very hard to say. I\u2014I, but I \u2014my\u2014my ass umption is that there will be a significant chunk \u2014chunk well into the millions.   I\u2014I don \u2019t want to give you a number , because it \u2019s going to be a guess , but well, well into the millions of people who \u2014who don\u2019 t get to go back to their old job.  And, in fact, there isn \u2019t a\u2014there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time.  There will   eventually be, but it could be some years before we get back to those people finding jobs.  I mean, when\u2014when people lose a job, if they can find a job in their own industry, that \u2019s usually the fastest way, is\u2014is they know other people in that industry, different kinds of jobs .  That\u2019s usually the fastest.   If you have to go to a different industry and start over again, it \u2019s much harder, and that \u2019s where you start to lose people \u2019s\u2014who are \u2014just fall out of the labor force.   And\u2014and, you know, it \u2019s very tough on their lives.  We all know people who\u2014to whom that happened in the Global F inancial C risis, and, hence, our desire to\u2014to do what we can to support this and\u2014 and\u2014an d support this recovery with\u2014 with the tools that we have\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.   Nancy Marshall -Genzer,  Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I\u2019m wondering\u2014I want to go back to the issue of inequality, and I\u2019m won dering, what more could the Fed do to reduce economic inequality in this country?   I mean, I know that you said you don\u2019 t target certain groups, but is there a way that you could use, for example, the black unemployment rate as \u2014as some kind of a benchmark to something you \u2019d want to meet or something that you\u2019d  keep track of?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  We do.  We do t rack all unemployment by all kinds, as you know \u2014all kinds of different demographics, including particularly the African  American unemployment rate, which reached an all -time low since the data started being kept in the modern era.   Of course, it \u2019s still close to twice the white unemployment \u2014it is twice the unemployment rate, or it was back  in the \u2014back  then.  It\u2019s certainly much higher now.  You know, the \u2014the  best thing we can do with our monetary policy tools is to\u2014is to look at, you know, the evidence of what we saw \u2014that we saw with our own eyes so recently, which is that the economy can have very low unemployment \u2014very low unemployment .  It could\u2019 ve   been low er than we were.  I t could be lower than 3\u00bd percent  without seeing financial imbalances, without seeing inflation going\u2014getting out of control.  We, frankly, didn \u2019t even get inflation back up to target \u2014without seeing wages getting out of touch with\u2014with wh ere they should be, so that \u2019s the\u2014that \u2019s the biggest thing we can do. You know, in\u2014in \u2014inequality is something that \u2019s been with us increasingly for more than four decades , and it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not really related to monetary policy .  It\u2019s, or\u2014or it \u2019s more related to \u2014there are a lot of theories on \u2014on what causes it, but it \u2019s been something that \u2019s more or less been going up consistently for more than four decades .  And there are a lot of different theories, one of which is \u2014just is that it\u2014globalization \u2014globalization and technology call for rising levels of skills and aptitudes and education, and that  U.S. educational attainment kind of flattened out, certainly relative to our peers \u2014flattened out over that period. And so a lot \u2014so that means if you\u2019 re\u2014if you\u2019 re on the r ight side of those trends, then those things are good for you.  If you\u2019 re not, then your wages are going to stagnate .  And wages for the bottom , you know, 10 percent  really haven \u2019t gone up in real terms in a very long time , and\u2014over a long period of time,  whereas wages for the people at the top , compensation, any way you cut it \u2014before taxes, after taxes, after transfers, all of those, any way you cut it \u2014wages have \u2014compensation has gone up a whole lot for people at the top, and it really hasn\u2019 t gone up for people at the bottom.  If you look more in the middle, then it \u2019s\u2014then\u2014then it has gone up for most other groups , but at the bottom, not so much in real terms, in  inflation -adjusted  terms.  So, you know, we \u2014we call it out as a\u2014as an important factor in the e conomy, and we will use our tools to support maximum employment and take that , you know, definition to heart.  But, obviously, that \u2019s something that \u2019s going to require an all -of-society, all -of-government  response.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and Radio.  I came across a statistic the other day that amazed me.   Since your March 23 emergency announcement, every single stock in the S &P 500 has delivered a  positive return.  And I\u2019m wondering, given the levels of the market right now, whether you or your colleagues feel there is a possible bubble blowing that could pop and set  back the recovery significantly, or that we might see capital misallocation that will leave us worse off when this is over . Second, inequality is not just about wages, it \u2019s also about wealth.  A nd a number of studies have suggested that by keep ing rates low for so long and targeting the markets after the great financial crisis, that the Fed did contribute to wealth inequality in this country.   And I \u2019m wondering if you think there is some tweak or some message you could give that would affect  that\n\nCHAIR POWELL: .   What we \u2019ve targeted is broader financial conditions.  If you go back to the end of February and early March, you had\u2014basically , the world markets realized at just about the same time \u2014I remember that Monday \u2014that there was going to be a global pandemic , and that this possibility that it would be contained in one province in China, for all practical purposes, was not going to happen.  It all\u2014it was \u2014you know, it was Iran, Italy, Korea, and then it became clear in markets.   From that point forw ard, investors everywhere in the world, for a period of weeks , wanted to sell everything that wasn \u2019t cash or a \u2014a short -term Treasury  instrument.   They didn\u2019 t want it to have any risk at all.  And so what happened is , markets stopped working.  They stopped working, and companies couldn\u2019 t\u2014couldn\u2019 t borrow .  They couldn\u2019 t roll over their debt.   People couldn\u2019 t borrow.  So that \u2019s\u2014that \u2019s the kind of situation that   can be  very\u2014financial turbulence and malfunction\u2014a  financial system that \u2019s not working can greatly amplify the negative effects of what was clearly going to be a major economic shock.  So what our tools were \u2014were put to work to do was to restore the markets to function.  And I think, you know, some of that has really happened, as I \u2014as I ment ioned in my opening remarks, and that \u2019s a good thing.  So we \u2014we \u2019re not looking to achieve a particular level of any asset price.   What we want is investors to be pricing in risk like markets are supposed to do.  Borrowers are borrowing .  Lenders are lendin g.  We want the markets to be working.   And , again, we \u2019re not looking to\u2014to a particular level.  I think our \u2014our principal focus , though, is on \u2014on the state of the economy and on the labor market and on inflation.  Now, inflation, of course, is \u2014is low, and we think it \u2019s very likely to remain low for some time , below our target.   So, really, it \u2019s about getting the labor market back and getting it in shape .  That\u2019s\u2014that \u2019s been our major focus.  And I would say,  you know, we\u2014if we were to hold back because\u2014we would never do this, but \u2014the idea that, just the concept that we would hold back because we think asset prices are too high \u2014others may not think so, but we just decided that that \u2019s the case \u2014what would happen to those people?   You know, what woul d happen to the people that we \u2019re actually legally supposed to be serving?   We\u2019re supposed to be pursuing maximum employment and stable prices, and that \u2019s what we \u2019re pursuing.  We\u2019re also pursuing financial stability, but there you have a banking system tha t is so much better capitalized, so much stronger, better aware of its risks, better at managing its risks, more highly liquid.  You have all of those things .  And they\u2019 ve been lending.  T hey\u2019ve been taking in deposits .  They\u2019ve been a source of strength in this situation.    So I would say that , you know, we \u2019re tightly focused on our real economy goals.  And \u2014and, again, not \u2014we \u2019re not \u2014we \u2019re not focused on moving asset prices in a particular direction at all.  It\u2019s just we want markets to be working, and I think, partly as a result of what we\u2019 ve done, they\u2014they are working.  A nd, you know, we hope that continues.

The most crucial response to this crisis has come from our healthcare workers, and we express our sincere gratitude to them and all essential workers who have helped meet our basic needs during these challenging times.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant decline in spending and production, resulting in the most severe decline in real GDP on record. Despite a positive employment report in May, there has been a substantial loss of jobs and a rise in unemployment, particularly affecting lower-wage workers, women, and minority groups. While there are some signs of stabilization and a modest rebound in certain sectors, overall economic activity remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels.Despite improvements in the job market, historically high unemployment persists, while weak demand in pandemic-affected sectors is keeping consumer prices low. Inflation has fallen below the 2 percent objective, and the severity of the economic downturn and pace of recovery depend on successfully containing the virus, restoring confidence, and implementing effective policy actions. The Federal Reserve is committed to using all available tools to support the economy and achieve maximum employment and price stability.The Federal Reserve has been taking strong actions to support the flow of credit in the economy, as without access to credit, families could be forced to cut back on necessities or even lose their homes, and businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further job and income losses. Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and setting the stage for recovery.The Federal Reserve is utilizing emergency lending powers to provide financing and serve as a backstop to credit markets, increasing the willingness of private lenders to extend credit. These programs are only available in unusual circumstances and will continue to be used aggressively until the economy is on the road to recovery.In order to provide assistance to those who may struggle to repay loans, direct fiscal support may be necessary, as elected officials have the power to allocate resources. The CARES Act and other legislation have already demonstrated the positive impact of direct support in helping families, businesses, and the economy, and at this meeting, the discussion focused on utilizing tools such as forward guidance and asset purchases, as well as considering historical and foreign experiences with targeting interest rates.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will assess their monetary policy stance and communications as more information about the economy becomes available in upcoming meetings. They have resumed their regular quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which provides insight into how FOMC participants are evaluating the future path of the economy, although it does not represent a Committee view.The Federal Reserve acknowledges the pain of racial injustice and expresses its commitment to diversity, inclusion, and fair access to credit. They are dedicated to using their tools to support the economy and ensure a robust recovery.The speaker expresses gratitude and anticipates the upcoming questions.", "question_answer_summary": ["QUESTION: What are the reasons for the Committee's decision to wait on reinforcing forward guidance and implementing yield caps?\n\nANSWER: The Committee believes that current monetary policy is well positioned to support the economy. They have already lowered the policy rate to the effective lower bound and will keep it there until the economy recovers. They have also taken measures to support credit flow and asset purchases. The path of the economy depends on the pandemic, so they will continue to evaluate their stance and communications as more information becomes available.", "'QUESTION': Why is policy appropriate now given the low inflation forecast and why not use all available tools to address it?\n'ANSWER': Our current policy stance is appropriate and we are using our emergency lending tools extensively. We have asset purchases and are prepared to adjust as needed. The economy is reopening and we need to learn more about its path. We have to be humble about our ability to increase inflation, especially with high unemployment. We will assess the best way to deploy our tools to achieve our goals.", "'QUESTION': How firm is the commitment to lower interest rates and will the Fed stick with low interest rates if things turn out better than expected?\n'ANSWER': The commitment to lower interest rates is firm and the Fed is willing to tolerate very low unemployment rates and focus on getting inflation back up. They are not thinking about raising rates and are focused on providing support for the economy, even if there is strong job growth.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that the strong performance in the stock market is disconnected from economic reality?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell does not believe that the Great Depression is a good example or likely outcome for the current situation. He highlights the fast and forceful government response, the healthy state of the economy before the crisis, and the well-capitalized financial system as fundamental differences. He emphasizes the need to learn from the incoming data about the reopening of the economy and expects a weak second quarter followed by a gradual recovery over time.", "'QUESTION': What kind of data is the Fed looking at to gauge the potential long-term impact on the economy and what is it telling us so far?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is concerned about lasting damage to the productive capacity of the US economy, particularly through extended periods of unemployment and businesses going out of business permanently. They are looking at measures to support hiring, growth, and avoid unnecessary business insolvencies to mitigate these risks. It is too early to determine if there will be longer-term damage to the economy.", "QUESTION: Can you provide clarity on the ongoing bond buying program and the delay in the Main Street Lending Program?\n\nANSWER: Market function has improved but not fully recovered, and the bond buying program supports accommodative financial conditions. The Main Street Lending Program has undergone changes based on feedback and will now offer more favorable terms for borrowers. Loans are expected to start soon after lenders are registered, and the facility will be up and running shortly after. The Fed is prepared to adapt further if needed.", "'QUESTION': Is the Fed considering more comprehensive regulatory forbearance measures or other regulatory measures to prevent businesses from going under due to inability to meet payments?\n'ANSWER': The Fed can make changes to bank regulation and supervision, but it does not have the authority to make changes in mortgage or credit card payments. Those decisions would require legislative action or be determined by the banks themselves. The Fed encourages forbearance and has no legal authority to make those decisions.", "'QUESTION': Do you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that Congress extend the $600 a week extra unemployment benefits given the forecast for elevated unemployment rates?\n'ANSWER': The response from fiscal authorities to the economic shock has been large, forceful, and quick. The $3 trillion authorized by Congress has benefited households, workers, businesses, hospitals, and governments. The expanded unemployment insurance and stimulus checks have helped replace lost income. It's a good response so far, but the question is whether it will be big enough and if further support will be needed. The specifics of the $600 unemployment insurance are up to Congress.", "'QUESTION': What is the current state of the labor market and what needs to be done to get people back to work?\n'ANSWER': The U-6 measure of unemployment has tripled from 7% to 21%, indicating that 22 million additional people have lost work. Another measure shows that about 24 million people have been affected. The key is to get these people back to work, as they didn't do anything wrong. The response so far has been great, but there is still a lot of work to do. The decision to reopen the economy is up to elected officials, and a second wave of the virus could undermine the recovery and people's confidence in certain sectors.", "'QUESTION': Do you think it is too late for the Main Street lending facilities and how long do you expect them to impact the economy?\n'ANSWER': We believe there is still significant interest and companies are getting financed through banks and markets. We will keep the facilities open for new loans as long as needed, in coordination with the Treasury Department. At a certain point, further loans won't be necessary and the assets will remain. We don't have expertise in managing credit assets, so we are exploring options for that. Our focus now is on getting the facilities operational and effective.", "'QUESTION': Have we hit bottom for the economy and how does the pandemic exacerbate racial inequality in terms of maximum employment?\n'ANSWER': Forecasters expect the economy to hit bottom around the middle of the year, but there is uncertainty. The labor market may have hit bottom in May, but it's too early to conclude. The pandemic has disproportionately affected industries involving tight groups of people, leading to higher unemployment rates for Hispanics, African Americans, and women. The goal is to support the labor market and economy until full recovery, aiming to return to a tight labor market that benefits lower-wage workers.", "'QUESTION': To what extent is future fiscal policy factored into the economic projections and how might fiscal policy affect those projections? What is the threshold for expanding the Main Street program?\n'ANSWER': The economic projections do not incorporate uncertain future fiscal support, but may include a modest amount based on current negotiations. More fiscal support would lead to better results, but it is up to Congress to decide. The Fed is considering incorporating nonprofits into the Main Street program and is open to making changes based on new information.", "'QUESTION': What is the expectation for the permanency of job losses?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell does not have a reliable estimate, but believes that a significant chunk, well into the millions, of people will not be able to go back to their old jobs. It may take some years for these individuals to find new jobs, especially if they have to switch industries. The Federal Reserve aims to support the recovery with the tools available.", "'QUESTION': What more could the Fed do to reduce economic inequality in the country, such as using the black unemployment rate as a benchmark?\n'ANSWER': The Fed tracks unemployment rates for various demographics, including African Americans. While the unemployment rate for African Americans reached an all-time low, it is still twice the rate of white unemployment. The best thing the Fed can do is maintain low unemployment without causing financial imbalances or inflation, but reducing inequality requires a broader societal and government response.", "QUESTION: Do you believe there is a possible bubble in the stock market that could set back the recovery significantly and contribute to wealth inequality?\n\nANSWER: Our focus is on restoring the functioning of the markets and ensuring investors price in risk appropriately. We are not aiming for a specific asset price level. Our main goals are the state of the economy, the labor market, and inflation. We are committed to pursuing maximum employment, stable prices, and financial stability. The banking system is stronger and better at managing risks. Our focus is on the real economy, not moving asset prices in a particular direction."]}
