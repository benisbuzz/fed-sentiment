Madam Chair, this notion of uncertainty in economic and global developments \u2014is it fair to say that it could be many months before those global developments work their way t hrough  the U .S. economic data, and that you would not have the certainty that you \u2019re looking for to raise interest rates for many months and perhaps well into next year?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  Well, Steve, I think you can see from the SEP projections that most participants continue d to think that economic conditions wil l call for or make appropr iate a n   increase in the federal funds rate by the end of this year.  Four participants moved their projections into 2016 or later, but the great majority of participants continued to hold that view .  And, of course, there will always be uncertainty.  We ca n\u2019t expect that uncertainty to be fully resolved.  But, in light of the developments that we have seen and the impacts on financial markets, we want to take a little bit more time to evaluate the likely impacts on the United States.  And, as I mentioned, t he inflation outlook has softened slightly.  We\u2019ve had some further developments \u2014namely , lower oil prices and a further appreciation of the dollar \u2014that have put some downward pressure in the near term on inflation.  Now, we fully expect those further effec ts, like the earlier moves in the dollar and in oil prices , to be transitory .  But there is a little bit of downward pressure on inflation , and we would like to see some further developments .  And this , importantly , could include \u2014is likely to include \u2014further improvements in the labor market that would bolster our confidence tha t inflation will move back to 2  percent over the medium term.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.   Could I ask about the next meeting, which is in October ?  Do you view that as a live meeting even though there isn \u2019t going to be a scheduled press conference at that time ?

Is it more important , the developments  in the fin ancial market s, or is it more to do with the upcoming data?  Thanks very much.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, as I \u2019ve said before, every meeting is a live meeting where the Committee can make a decision to move to change our target for the federal funds rate.  That certainly includes October.  As you know , and I \u2019ve stressed previously, were we to decide to do that, we would call a press briefing , and you \u2019ve participated in an exercise to make sure that you   would know how to participate in that press briefing should it happen.  So, yes, October remains a possibility.  And we will be looking at incoming developments , both financial an d economic , to try to make sure w e feel , really , that the U .S. economy is doing well.  You know, I want to emphasize , domestic developments have been strong.  We see domestic demand growing at a solid pace, the labor market  continuing to improve.  Of course, we will watch incoming data to confirm our expectation that that will continue.   And we , of course , will watch glo bal financial and economic development s.  I can \u2019t give you a recipe for exactly what we \u2019re looking to see , but, as we say, we want to see continued improvement in the labor market , and we would like to bolster our confidence tha t inflation will move back t o 2 percent .

There could be other things we would see that could bolster that confidence , but further improvement in the labor market will serve to do that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:   Hi.  Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times.   There were a group of protesters out here before your meeting.  There was  a similar group at Jackson Hole .  They and others have warned the F ed not to raise the rate because \u2014out of concern that the labor market is not fully healed, wages haven \u2019t risen fast enough .  What impact, if any, has that had on you and your colleagues in your decision today?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, we have been receiving advice from a large number of economists and interested groups , and that \u2019s of course appropriate , and we value hearing the opinions of many \u2014you know, many different groups and individuals with different perspectives.   But, look, at the end of the day, it \u2019s the Committee \u2019s job to come together to analyze the data that we have on the economy , to decide how it affects the outlook , and to try to deliberate and arrive at a Committee judgment about the appropriate path of policy, and that \u2019s what we did today.  As   I said, although we are close to many participant \u2019s [estimates]  and the median estimate of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment, at least my own judgment \u2014and this has been true for a long time \u2014is that there are additional margins of slack , particularly relating to very high levels of part -time involuntary employme nt and labor force participation , that suggest that , at least to some extent , the standard unemployment rate understates the degree of slack in the labor market.  But we are getting closer.  The labor market has improved.  And, as I\u2019ve said in the past, we  don\u2019t want to wait until we \u2019ve fully met both of our objectives to begin the process of tightening policy give n the lags in the operation of  monetary policy.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Kate Davidson from the Wall Street Journal.   Madam Chair, do you thin k, over the past two months since your last meeting , that you \u2019ve gotten clos er to or further away from the F ed\u2019s inflation goals ?  And then , separately, you \u2019ve received a congressional subpoena relating to the disc losure of information from the F ed\u2019s Septe mber 2012 policy meeting.  Are you any closer to complyin g with that ?  Have you turned over any new information to Congress?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, your first question was, have we come closer or move d further  away  from our inflation goal.  So we \u2019ve used the same language , which is  that we expect to achieve our 2 present goal over the medium term , and I would say , although we \u2014as we say in our statement, recent developments seem likely to put some downward pressure .  We\u2019re, after all, way below our inflation target.   But an important reason for that is that declines in  import prices reflecting the appreciation of the dollar and decline s in energy prices are holding down inflation well below our target and well below core inflation.  We expect those effects to be transitory , and with well -anchored inflation expectations, we expect inflation to move  back to 2 percent .  Now, in the intermeeting period, we have seen some further appreciation of the dollar   and some further downward pressure on energy prices , and that creates a bit of further drag on inflation that I would view as transitory \u2014is very likely to be transitory.  So I continue and the Committee continues to expect tha t inflation will move back to 2 percent , so this should be a smal l thing.  And, in the meantime, the labor market has continued to improve, so a tighter labor market, a labor market moving toward full employment , is one t hat historically has generated upward  pressure on inflation.  So that bolsters my confidence in infl ation.   On the other hand, we\u2019ve had a long period in which inflation has been running below our objective.  I consider it , and the Committee does , very important that we \u2014we achieve our inflation objective and defend against inflation that is persistently above our inflation objective and also persistently below our inflation objective.  And we want to have not only an expectation , but a good degree of confidence that that will occur.  We did take note in the statement of a decline in inflation compensation , and it \u2019s hard to get a direct read on inflation expectations out of these measures.   They can be pushed down by factors pertaining to liquidit y in the T reasury \u2014in the TIPs  market and other issues pertaining to risk premia, but we have taken note of that , and I would say that that\u2019s something that has caught our attention and is a  factor that we \u2019re watching.  So we \u2019d like to have a little bit more confidence , but I would not interpret developments during the intermeeting period as significantly undermining confidence.  And the labor market is really important that as it continues to improve \u2014it has , and we want to see it improve further \u2014that serves to bolster c onfidence.  Oh, I\u2019m sorry , you asked about the September 2012 leak.  We are working very closely with House Financial Services C ommittee that \u2019s requested information to satisfy their request.  We\u2019re working very closely with them.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Binya  Appelbaum, the New York Times.   The economic projections that you all released today show that Committee members expect roughly a three -year period in which the unemployment rate will be at its lowest sustainable level and yet inflation will not rise abov e 2 percent.  That seems extraordinary .  Could you talk about why , as a moment ago you said we would expect  inflationary pressures when unemployment is at a low level?   Why is inflation going to be so weak for so long under those circumstances , and does it  indicate \u2014when you are projecting that basically much of a decade will have passed without the Fed reaching its inflation target \u2014does it indicate that you have failed to do enough to revive this economy in recent years?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, we have been very focused, Binya, on doing everything we can to revive this economy and to achieve our maximum employment objective.  And after we took the funds rate down to zero, as you know, we put in place a number of other extraordinary measures \u2014including forward guidance and large -scale asset purchases \u2014in order to speed the recovery and attain both our inflation objective and our maximum employment objective.  And, I mean , when you look at the projection, you see , as you mentioned , that we see s ufficient growth to push the unemployment rate.  It\u2019s already very close to participants \u2019 estimates of its longer -run normal level.  We expect the unemployment rate to fall slightly \u2014or, at least , participants project that it will fall slightly below that l evel.  As that occurs, we would expect labor force participation, the cyclical component of that , to diminish over time , and we would hope to see some decline in the portion of slack that \u2019s reflected in high levels of part -time involuntary employment.  Now,  inflation is going back in our projection to 2 percent .  It takes to 2018 to get there.  It\u2019s awfully close in 2017 , and it \u2019s not terribly far away even next year.  We have very large   drags from import prices and energy prices , and over the next  year or so, those things should dissipate .  And the behavior of inflation should mainly \u2014if we \u2014if our understanding of the inflationary process is correct and if inflation exp ectations are well anchored at 2 , which I believe they are , as the labor market heals and a s that healing progresses, we will see further upward pressure on inflation.  That\u2019s what we expect.  Now, it \u2019s a slow process, it \u2019s characterized by lags , and that \u2019s why it takes a few years as the inflation \u2014as the unemployment rate falls and even overshoots its longer -run normal level, it just takes some time  for inflation to get back to 2 percent.  But the overshooting helps it  get back faster than it otherwise would .  And it\u2019s certainly important for us , and I think our credibility hinges on defe nding our inflat ion target not only from threats  that it rises above , but also that we not have \u2014that over the medium term , that we want  to see inflation get back to 2 percent .  And we believe the policies we \u2019re following are des igned to accomplish that and  will do so.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, thanks.   Ylan from the Washington Post.   I want to kind of piggybac k on Binya \u2019s question a little bit and brin g up the old thresholds of 6.5 percent unemployment and 2.5 percent  inflation as the period during which the F ed promi sed to ke ep interest rates low.  That had sort of assumed \u2014I guess sort of suggested  that the F ed was comfortabl e with inflation rising above 2 percent .  But you just said moments ago that you don \u2019t want to wait until inflation actually hit s your target before you are ready to lift off.  So I wonder if you could explain that a little bit.  Is there a shift in how much inflation the Fed is actually willing to accept?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So let me be clear \u20142 percent is our objective.  We wan t to see  inflation go back to 2 percent ; 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation.  So we \u2019re not trying to push the inflation rate above 2.  It\u2019s always our ob jective to get back to 2, but 2 percent  is not a ceiling.  And if it were a ceiling, you would have to be conducting a policy that , on average ,   would hold the inflation rate below 2 percent .  That is not our policy.  We want to see t he inflation rate get back to 2 percent  as rapidly as we can.  But there are lags in the impact of monetary policy on the economy .  And if we waited until inflation is back to 2 \u2014and that would probably mean that unemployment had declined well below our estimates of the natural rate \u2014and only then did we start to \u2014begin to \u2014and, you know, the word  \u201ctighten\u201d monetary policy I don\u2019t think  is really right because we have an immensely accommodative monetary policy in place.  So, let me say, just to begin to diminish the extraordinary degree of accommodation for monetary policy, we would be overshoot \u2014we would likel y overshoot substantially our  2 percent  object ive, and we might be faced with then  having to tighten policy in a way that could be disruptive to the real economy.   And I don\u2019t \u2014I don \u2019t think that \u2019s a desirable way to conduct policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Jeanna S mialek , Bloomberg News.  You mentioned earlier that, you know, there is always going to be some uncertainty in the global economy, yet it seems that uncertainties are what kept you from hiking this month.  You know, ho w do you communicate to markets w hat is the kind of uncertainty  that keeps you from lifting rates and what is the kind of uncertainty you can overlook and, you know, move in spite of?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, that \u2019s a very hard question , and, you know, it \u2019s why we come together and have very careful evaluations of a wide ra nge of factors.  But, at the end of the day, what we \u2019re focused on are two things :  the path for employment and whether or not we feel confident that we \u2019re on a road that will take us to our maximum employment objective and whether or not we see the risks around obtaining that as balanced.   Of course , there will be uncertainty around it  and whether or not we have reasonable confidence that inflation,  will, ove r the medium term, go back to 2 percent .  And it \u2019s really through that filter that we \u2019re trying to   look at uncertainty.  Of course , there are ma ny uncertainties in the global economy , but we \u2019re asking ourselves how economic and financial developments in the global economy affect the risk to our outlook for our two goals and whether or not they create un balanced risks that we want to wait to resolve , to some extent.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Yellen.   Peter Barnes, F ox Business.  Could you talk about \u2014a little bit more specifically about what foreign developments you discussed in the meeting today, what you \u2019re concerned about?  We all assume it might be China \u2014that was in the July minutes.  Are you concerned about the Chinese economy slowing , the markets there?  Do you have any concerns about the European economy?  And then , related to stock markets, could I ask you how you feel about U .S. equity markets right now ?  Because you did talk about your concerns about them back in May.  You saw they were generally quite high and were worried about potential dangers in U .S. equity market valuations , but now equity pri ces have pulled back.  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, with respect to global developments, we reviewed developments in all important areas of the world , but we \u2019re focused particularly on China and emerging markets.   Now, we \u2019ve long expected, as most analyst s have , to see some slowing in Chinese growth over time as they rebalance their economy.  And they have planned that , and  I think there are no surprises there.  The question is whether or not there might be a risk of a more abrupt slowdown than most analys ts expect.  And I think developments that we saw in financial markets in August in part reflected concerns that  Chinese \u2014there was downside risk to Chinese economic performance and perhaps concerns about the de ftness with which policymakers were addressing those concerns.    In addition, we saw a very substantial downward pressure on oil prices and commodity markets , and those developments have had a significant impact on many emerging market economies that are important producers of commodities as well as more  advanced countries , including Canada, which is an important trading partner of ours that has been negatively affected by declining commodity prices, declining energy prices.    Now, there are a lot of countries that are net importers of energy that are pos itively affected by those developments , but emerging markets \u2014important emerging markets \u2014have been negatively affected by those developments.  And we \u2019ve seen significant outflows of capital from those countries, pressures on their exchange rates , and concerns about their performance going forward.  So a lot of our focus has been on risks around China , but not just China \u2014emerging markets , more generally , and how they may spill over to the United States.  In terms of thinking about financial develop ments and our reaction to them, I think a lot of the financial developments were really \u2014so, we don \u2019t want to respond to market  turbulence.  The F ed should not be responding to the ups and downs of the markets , and it is certainly not our policy to do so.  But when there are significant financial developments, it \u2019s incumbent on us to ask ourselves what is causing them.  And, of course , while we can \u2019t know for sure, it seem ed to us as though concerns about the global economic outlook were drivers of those fin ancial development s.  And so they have concerned us in part because they take us to the global outlook and how that will affect us.  And, to some extent, look, we have seen a tightening of financial conditions during \u2014as I mentioned, during the intermeeting  period.  So the stock market adjustment , combined with a somewhat stronger dollar and higher risk spreads , does represent some tightening of financial conditions.    Now, in and of itself, it \u2019s not the end of story in terms of our policy because we have to put a lot of different pieces together.  We are looking at, as I emphasized, a U .S. economy that has been performing well and impressing us by the pace at which it \u2019s creating jobs and the strength of domestic demand.   So we have that.   We have some concerns  about negative impacts from global developments and some tightening of financial conditions.  We\u2019re trying to put all of that together in a picture.   I think, importantly , we say in our statem ent that in spite of all of this , we continue to view the risks to economic activity and labor markets as balanced.  So it\u2019s a lot of different pieces, different cross currents, some strengthening the outlook, some creating concerns, but overall, no significant change in the economic out look.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Ann Saphir with Reuters.

That is not the way I see the outlook or the way the Committee sees the outlook.   Can I  completely rule it out?  I can \u2019t completely rule it out.

If the economy develops as the Summary of Economic Projection s suggests , you will see improvement in labor markets , but it won \u2019t push inflation up any faster.  So I\u2019m wondering what the argument is for raising rates this year as suggested by the dot plot, because even allowing for long a nd variable lags, you \u2019re not forecasting an inflation problem that would seem to suggest the need for a steeper and faster rate path for at least a couple of years.  \n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long ti me from here and the economy performs as we expect \u2014namely , it\u2019s strong and the risks that are out there don \u2019t materialize \u2014my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections .  And the lags will be pr obably slow, but eventually we will find ourselves with a substantial overshoot of our inflation objective , and then we \u2019ll be forced into a kind of stop \u2013go policy.  We will have pushed the economy so far it will have become overheated , and we will then hav e to tighten policy more abruptly than we \u2019d like.  And instead of having slow , steady growth , improvement in the labor market , and continued improvement and good performance in the labor market, I don \u2019t think it \u2019s good policy to have to then slam on the br akes and risk a downturn in the economy.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Mike Derby with Dow Jones Newswires.  One of your colleagues in the dot plots  said they\u2019d like to see negative interest rates \u2014didn\u2019t expect to see that.  What do you make of negative interest rates as a potential  source of new stimulus if the F ed were to have to do something more, you know, as o pposed to  maybe  going to QE ?  Does negative interest rates have any part \u2014does it \u2014is it\u2014should it be part of the F ed\u2019s toolkit , essentially?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  So, let me be clear that negative interest rates was not something that we considered very seriously at all today.  It\u2019s\u2014was not one of our main policy options.  But one participant in the Committee would like to see additional accommodation , is concerned by the inflation outlook , and thin ks that we need additional stimulus, additional accommodation to provide that , and propose d doing so by moving interest rates negative.  That\u2019s something we \u2019ve seen in several European countries.  It\u2019s not something we talked  about today.  Look , if\u2014I don \u2019t expect that we \u2019re going to be in a path of providing additional accommodation , but if the outlook were to change in a way that most of my colleagues and I do not expect and we found ourselves   with a weak economy that needed additional stimulus, we would look at all of our available tools , and that would be something that we would evaluate in that kind of context.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.  In July, when you were talking to us , you said that you yourself expected to see the first rate hike before the end of the year.  Is that still your expectation?  And also, when you talked about the developments in financial markets and what caused the August turbulence \u2014you mentioned China and  other things \u2014you did  mention the prospects of a Fed rate increase.  Do you think that played a role as well?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So you ask me about my own expectation , and I \u2019d say \u2014I don \u2019t want to\u2014I speak on behalf of the Committee and try to explain Committee  decisions , and we don \u2019t identify who \u2019s who in terms of our projections of the funds rate , and I don \u2019t want to change that and have the focus be on my personal views on the path.  You know, I have characterized the Committee view as , you know, a forecast  that will likely, if it prevails, if that \u2019s how the economy evolves, call for a funds rate increase later this year.  And I think that \u2019s a fair summary of the Committee \u2019s assessment of things.  You asked me, I think, also about uncertainty about our own policies?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Well, no, not uncertainty , just the fact that the market turbulence \u2014a lot of people in August said part  of that was a concern about the F ed was about to raise interest rates, and you did n\u2019t mention that as one reason for the turbulence.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I think the main drivers of the turbulence have been concerns about the global outlook, that \u2019s how I read it .  But I know that, of cour se, there is uncertainty about F ed policy.  As I mentio ned, we \u2019re well aware that there \u2019s been a huge focus on the decision today.   And, you know, I would  ask you to appreciat e that there are a lot of cross -  currents in economic and financial developments that we need to take into account in deciding on what th e appropriate course of policy is.  And we don \u2019t make continuous decisions every single day about our policy , we meet periodically.  We do our darndest to pull together the best analysis we can and to exchange views and to arrive at Committee decisions.  I do understand that , during this intermeeting pe riod, that every word that an FOM C member has said has been parsed for its potential implications for what our decision will be.  I think it \u2019s, you know \u2014that\u2019s an unfortunate state of affairs, but I understand , and I think it \u2019s natural when you \u2019re at a point when conditions may  be falling in place for there to be a shift in policy.   It\u2019s natural that that should happen , and it does,  to some extent , contribute to uncertainty in financial markets.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Michelle Fleury, BBC News.  You talked a lot about the strong dollar.   I wondered, do you see your policy actions affecting the dollar?  Is it something you consider when you are making your policy decisions?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So, monetary policy \u2014U.S. monetary policy is directed toward trying to achieve the goals the Congress has laid out for us.  When we \u2014when monetary policy tightens and interest rates rise, it commonly is the case , either when it happens or in expectation \u2014the expectation that that \u2019s coming \u2014interest rate differentials globally do tend to reduce  capital flows that have impacts on exchange rates .1  So monetary policy often has some effect on the exchange rate, and it \u2019s not , in my view , the main channel by which monetary policy works.  It\u2019s one of a number of different channels by which monetary policy works , but it does have some impact on exchange rates , and, of course, yes, we need to take that into account.                                                   1 Chair Yellen intended to say that \u201cinterest rate differentials globally do tend to  induce  capital flows that have impacts on exchange rates.\u201d  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I want to see if you would shift gears  a little bit and talk about the housing market.  You say in the statement , the housing market has improved .  How much are you counting on the housing market for growth going forward , especially since the Committee sees rates rising?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we are envisioning further improvements in the housing market.  It remains ver y depressed \u2014housing starts bel ow levels that seem consistent with underlying demographics, especially in an economy that \u2019s creating jobs , and we have lots of pe ople who are still doubled up , and demand for housing should be there and should materialize as the job market improves and income growth improves.   So, are we counting on it?  Housing is now a very small sector of the economy.   It is not the driver of \u2014it is not the key driver in my own forecast of ongoing improvements in the U .S. economy.   It plays a supporting role , but consumer spending is the main driver , bolstered by, you know, a decent outlook for investment spending.  But I would continue to expect h ousing to improve.  And, remember, we \u2019re envisioning , if things go as we anticipate , a pretty gra dual path of increases in short -term interest rates over time.  To some extent , that\u2019s already embodied in longer term rates.  On the other hand , as time passe s and we move beyond the window in which short rates are zero, it will be natural for long rates to rise some.  And, of course , we recognize that the housing market is sensitive to mortgage rate s.  It\u2019s a\u2014it is an important factor.   But that \u2019s something that, of course , we are taking into account in  thinking about what \u2019s the appropriate path of policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  You mentioned you \u2019ve gotten a lot of unsolicited advice \u2014the folks outside.  But there is another side that says the F ed should raise interest rates because keeping rates so long \u2014so low for so long   has actually exacerbated th e wealth gap.  Do you think the F ed has widened the wealth gap with its low interest rate policy?  These people say low i nterest rates mainly benefit the wealthy.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I guess I really don \u2019t see it that way.  It is true that interest rates affect asset prices , but they have a complex effect through balance sheets, through liabilities and assets.  To me , the main thing that an accommodative monetary policy does is put people back to work.  And since income inequality is surely exacerbated by a high \u2014having high unemployment and a weak job market that has the most profound negative effects on the most vulne rable individuals, to me, putting people back to work and seeing a strengthening of the labor market that has a disproportionately favorable effect on vulnerable portions of our population, that \u2019s not something that increases income inequality.  There have been a number of studies that have done \u2014been done recently that have tried to take account of many different ways in which monetary policy , acting through different parts of the transmission mechanism , affect inequality.   And there \u2019s a lot of guesswork inv olved , and different analyse s can come up with different things.  But a pretty recent paper that \u2019s quite comprehensive concludes that Fed policy has not exacerbated income inequality.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks.  What \u2014I\u2019m Jon Prior with Politico .  What role did a possible government shutdown this year play in your decision today to delay the rate hike , and what would you say to lawmakers who are pursuing th is strategy yet again?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, it played absolutely no role in our decision.  I believe it \u2019s the responsibility of Congress to pass a budget, to fund the government, to deal with a debt ceiling so that America pays its bills.  We have a good recovery in place that \u2019s really making progress , and to see Congress take actions that would en danger that progress \u2014I think that would be more than unfortunate.  So, to me , that\u2019s Congress \u2019s job.  Congress charged us with forming an   economic outloo k that is focused on the medium  term and taking appropriate policy actions based on that outlook , and t hat\u2019s what we have done in the past and will continue to do going forward.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Madam Chair, Steve Beckner of MNI.  You said in y our opening statement that the F ed\u2019s policy of maintaining a large balance sheet \u2014by not starting to shrink that bala nce sheet by curtailing reinvestments and rollovers \u2014that helps add to your accommodative monetary stance on top of the near -zero federal funds rate.  By delaying rate hikes, logically , are you not also delaying reducing the balance sheet?  A year ago, the FOMC said it would not start shrinking the balance sheet and still it \u2019s\u2014until it started raising the funds rate.  So is it a concern that you are delaying normalization of the balance sheet ?  W as that an issue that you and your colleagues discussed?  Thank  you\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: .  We have been \u2014and this was reported in the minutes of our July meeting \u2014we have been discussing reinvestment policy.  Our normalization principles indicated that we would not begin to either reduce or eliminate reinvestments until after we have begun to raise the federal funds rate.  Our principles said that the exact timing of that would depend on economic and financial conditions and our evaluation of them, and that guidance continues to be accurate \u2014we don \u2019t have anything further on it .  But it is certainly true that we have committed to wait to begin running down our balance sheet until after we \u2019ve begun the process of normalization.  So, yes, if we defer, this is not a very large matter that we \u2019re talking about from a stimulus point of  view .  But it is , to some extent , true that if we delay raising the rate, it probably \u2014maybe delays the timing at which that process  will begin.  But there \u2019s no fixed \u2014we\u2019ve not given some fixed amount of time at so many months after we start .  And we \u2019re   continuing to discuss what the appropriate timing would be of that policy and haven \u2019t made any further decisions on that just yet. \n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 13, "dovish": 25, "neutral": 39}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 1, "dovish": 1, "neutral": 16}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 14, "dovish": 26, "neutral": 55}, "speech_summary": "In their recent policy statement, the Federal Open Market Committee reaffirmed the current target range for the federal funds rate. While the labor market has shown improvement, inflation remains below the desired level due to energy and import price declines, and recent global economic developments may further suppress inflation in the near future.The Federal Reserve acknowledges that the initial increase in the federal funds rate will not have a significant impact, and monetary policy will remain accommodative to support the economy. Despite challenges from net exports and oil prices, the US economy has shown stronger-than-expected growth, with continued job gains and increased household spending.The unemployment rate decreased slightly, but there are still concerns about the labor force participation rate, involuntary part-time employment, and wage growth. Inflation remains below the target, but it is expected to gradually increase as the labor market improves.The FOMC participants' economic projections for 2018 have been released, showing an increase in growth projections for this year compared to the previous meeting. The median growth projection for this year is 2.1 percent, slightly above the longer-run normal growth rate.The FOMC projects a slight decline in the unemployment rate next year, followed by stabilization. Inflation is expected to remain low this year due to lower energy and non-energy import prices, but is projected to rise in the coming years as transitory factors abate and labor market conditions improve. The recent uncertainties in the global outlook, particularly in China and other emerging market economies, have led to increased volatility in financial markets, which may have a restraining effect on U.S. economic activity and put further downward pressure on inflation. Given the interconnectedness of the U.S. and global economies, the situation abroad should be closely monitored.The recovery from the Great Recession has progressed enough and domestic spending is strong, making a case for a rise in interest rates. However, due to uncertainties abroad and a slightly softer inflation outlook, the Committee has decided to wait for more evidence of improvement in the labor market before raising rates.Many FOMC participants have lowered their projections for the federal funds rate, including estimates of the longer-run normal level. While most participants still expect to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later this year, some now believe it may not happen until next year or later.If the economy grows stronger and inflation rises more than expected, the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates at a faster pace. Conversely, if economic conditions weaken, the trajectory of interest rate hikes would be lower. The Federal Reserve will continue reinvesting proceeds from maturing securities to maintain accommodative financial conditions, and their large holdings of longer-term securities will support progress towards their objectives.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Is it fair to say that it could be many months before global developments work their way through the US economic data and that you would not have the certainty to raise interest rates for many months and perhaps well into next year?\n'ANSWER': Most participants still believe that economic conditions will call for an increase in interest rates by the end of this year. However, due to uncertainty and recent developments such as lower oil prices and a stronger dollar, we want to take more time to evaluate the impacts on the US and see further improvements in the labor market before making a decision.", "'QUESTION': Do you view the October meeting as a live meeting even though there won't be a scheduled press conference? What developments would you need to see to be confident in moving in the near term? Is it more important, the developments in the financial markets or the upcoming data?\n\n'ANSWER': Every meeting is a live meeting where the Committee can make a decision to change the federal funds rate. October remains a possibility. We will be looking at incoming developments in both financial and economic sectors to ensure the US economy is doing well. Continued improvement in the labor market and confidence in inflation reaching 2% are key factors.", "'QUESTION': What impact has the advice and concerns of economists and interest groups had on the FOMC's decision to raise the rate?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC values the opinions of different groups and individuals, but ultimately it is the Committee's responsibility to analyze the data and make a decision on policy. While there are still some indicators of slack in the labor market, the overall improvement justifies the decision to begin tightening policy.", "'QUESTION': Have you gotten closer to or further away from the Fed's inflation goals in the past two months? Have you complied with the congressional subpoena regarding the disclosure of information from the Fed's September 2012 policy meeting?\n'ANSWER': We expect inflation to move back to 2 percent despite recent downward pressure caused by the appreciation of the dollar and decline in energy prices. The labor market improvement bolsters confidence in inflation. We are working closely with the House Financial Services Committee to comply with their request for information regarding the September 2012 leak.", "QUESTION: Why is inflation expected to be weak for a long period of time despite low unemployment rates?\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve has taken various measures to revive the economy and achieve maximum employment. The unemployment rate is already close to its normal level, and as it falls further, inflation is expected to gradually increase. However, there are drags from import and energy prices that should dissipate in the next year, allowing inflation to reach 2 percent by 2018. The slow process is due to lags, but overshooting the unemployment rate helps speed up the return to 2 percent inflation. The Fed's policies are designed to achieve this goal.", "'QUESTION': Is there a shift in how much inflation the Fed is actually willing to accept?\n'ANSWER': 2 percent is the Fed's objective, not a ceiling. They want to see inflation go back to 2 percent as rapidly as possible, but waiting until inflation is back to 2 percent could lead to overshooting the objective and potentially disrupting the real economy.", "'QUESTION': How do you communicate to markets the kind of uncertainty that keeps you from lifting rates and what kind of uncertainty can you overlook and move in spite of?\n'ANSWER': We evaluate a wide range of factors, but ultimately we focus on the path for employment and whether we are confident in reaching our maximum employment objective. We also consider the risks around achieving that objective and whether we have reasonable confidence in inflation returning to 2 percent. We assess how economic and financial developments in the global economy impact the risk to our goals and whether they create unbalanced risks that we need to resolve.", "'QUESTION': Could you talk about the foreign developments discussed in the meeting and express concerns about the Chinese and European economies, as well as the U.S. equity markets?\n'ANSWER': We focused on China and emerging markets, expecting some slowing in Chinese growth. The financial market developments in August reflected concerns about Chinese economic performance and policymakers' response. Declining commodity prices have negatively affected emerging markets, leading to capital outflows and exchange rate pressures.
