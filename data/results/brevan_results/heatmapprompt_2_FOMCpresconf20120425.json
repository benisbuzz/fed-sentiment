The Fed has been forecasting for some time that inflation would fall to 2 percent or below .

I noticed that in your forecast today that the upper end of your forecast s all the way through 2014 have increased.

As you point out, core inflation and some other measures of underlying  inflation ha ve been a little stronger than expected .

And the fundamentals of inflation\u2014in particular, inflation expectations ; the amount of slack in the economy ; the commodity price behavior , which has been relatively well -controlled in recent mont hs\u2014all of those things suggest that inflation is going to stay close to or perhaps a bit below our 2 percent target .

Inflation is under control , and you say that you expect it to remain under control .  You sa y that you have additional tools available for you to use, but you\u2019 re not using them right  now .  Under these circumstances, it \u2019s really hard for a lot of people to understand why you are not using those tools right now .  Could you address that ?  And specifically , could you address whether your current views are inconsistent with the views on that subject that you held as an academic?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Yeah .  Let me tackle that second part first .  So there \u2019s this view circulating that the views I expressed about 15 years ago on the Bank of Japan are somehow inconsistent with our current policies .  That is absolutely incorrect .  Our \u2014my views and our policies today are completely consistent with the views that I held at that time .  I made two points at that time to the Bank of Japan .  The first was that I believe that a determined central b ank could and should work to eliminate deflation\u2014that is , falling prices .  The second point that I made was that when short -term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer \u2014are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation .  Now, looking at the current situation in United States, we are not in deflation .  When deflation became a significant risk in late 2010 , or at least a modest risk in late 2010, we used additional balanc e sheet tools to help return inflation close to the 2 percent target .  Likewise, we have been aggressive and creative in using non- federal -funds -rate-centered tools to achieve additional accommodation for the U .S. economy.  So the very critical difference between the Japanese situation 15 years ago and the U .S. situation today is that Japan was in deflation , April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    8 of 23  and, clearly , when you\u2019 re in deflation and in recession, then both sides of your mandates, so to speak, are demanding additional accommodation.  In thi s case , it\u2019s\u2014we are not in deflation, we have an inflation rate that \u2019s close to our objective .  Now, why don\u2019 t we do more ?  Well, first I would again reiterate that we are doing a great deal ; policy is extraordinarily accommodative .  We\u2014and I won\u2019 t go thro ugh the list again, but you know all the things that we have done to try to provide support to the economy .  I guess the question is, does it make sense to actively seek a higher inflation rate in order to achieve a slightly increased reduction \u2014a slightly increased pace of reduction in the unem ployment rate ?  The view of the Committee  is that that would be very reckless .  We have\u2014we, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation , which has proved extremely valuable in that we \u2019ve been be able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four  or five  years to support the economy without leading to a n unanchoring of inflation expectations or a destabilization of inflation.  To ri sk that asset for what I think would be quite tentative and perhaps doubtful gains on the real side would be, I think, an unwise thing to do.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Given your warnings to lawmakers about the looming fiscal cliff, do you think the Fed has to take into account when Congress chooses  to take action ?  If they waited \u2019 til January , say, would you feel obligated to take into the \u2014the potential economic blow into account?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, I think we \u2019ll have to take fiscal policy into account to some extent, but I think it \u2019s very important to say that if no action were to be taken by the fiscal authorities, the size of the fiscal cliff is such that there \u2019s, I think, absolutely no chance that the Federal Reserve could or would have any  ability whatsoever to offset that effect on the economy .  So I\u2014as I have said many times before, it \u2019s imperative for Congress to give us a fiscal policy April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    9 of 23  that achieves two principal objectives .  The first is, of course, to achieve fiscal sustainability ove r the longer term ; that is critical, and that \u2019s something that needs to be addressed.  At the same time, I think that can be done in a way that doesn\u2019 t endanger the short -term rec overy of the economy .  And I am  concern ed that if all the tax increases and spending cuts that are associated with the current law and which would take place \u2014absent  any cong ressional action \u2014were to occur o n January 1st, that that would be a significant risk to the recovery .  So I\u2019m looking and hoping that Congress will take actions that will address both sides of that \u2014both requirements of a good fiscal policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman , Josh Zumbrun from  Bloomberg News .  In today \u2019s statement you said , after coming quarters, you expect the econom y \u201cto pick up gradually .\u201d  Yet in the forecast that we got today, we see the forecast for 2013 and 2014, the growth forecast , is downgraded.  What caused you to downgrade your forecast for 2013 and 2014 when you see a pickup after the coming quarters?\nCHAI RMAN BERNANKE:  Well , again, these are the vi ews of the participants, the 17 participants .  So the basic feature that is described in our statement , which is that growth seems likely to pick up over time , is still obviously in our projections .  The 2013 numbers are stronger than the 2012 numbers , and the 2014 numbers are stronger than the 2013 numbers .  And the reason for that expected pickup over  time is , first , a very accommodative monetary policy , which continues to provide support for the recovery .  But in addition, some of the headwinds that have been affecting our recovery \u2014such as the housing market, financial stresses, credit tightness, and so on\u2014some of those things we hope will be lifting over  time and will allow the economy to grow more quickly and approach more quickly its longer -run full employment level .  April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    10 of 23  The reason \u2014I don\u2019 t know precisely why there \u2019s been a slight downgrade in years further out, but I suspect that the fiscal issues may be part of that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, you\u2019 ve made th e inflation t arget  sound a little bit more like an inflation ceiling , and you suggested that a b reaching of that ceiling or target would hurt the Fed \u2019s credibility .  Can you explain a little bit more about why you think going 50 basis points or a full perc entage point  above the 2 percent target would hurt the Fed\u2019 s credibility , and what that would do on the unemployment side if you were to do that?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  So it \u2019s not a ceiling, it\u2019 s a symmetric objective , and we attempt to bring inflation close  to 2 percent .  And in particular, if inflation were to jump for whatever reason \u2014and we don\u2019 t have, obviously don\u2019 t have perfect control of inflation\u2014we \u2019ll try to return inflation to 2 percent at a pace which takes into account the situation with respect to unemployment .  The risk of higher inflation\u2014 you say 2\u00bd percent ; well, 2 \u00bd percent expected change might involve a distribution of outcome s, some of which might be much higher than 2\u00bd percent .  And the concern we have is that if inflation were to run well  above 2 percent for a protracted period , that the credibility and the well- anchored inflation expectations , which are such a valuable asset of the Federal Reserve, might become eroded , in which case we would in fact have less rather than more flexibility to use accommodat ive monetary policy to achieve our employment goals .  I would cite to you, just as an example, if you look at Vice Chair Yellen \u2019s paper, which she gave\u2014 or speech , which she gave a couple of weeks ago, where she described a number of ways o f looking at the late 2014 guidance .  She showed there some so -called optimal policy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models , and what  you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes, assuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight\u2014very unrealistic assumptions \u2014still April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    11 of 23  involve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent .  So there is no presumption even in our econometric models that you need inflation well above target in or der to make progress on unemployment.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Peter Barnes, Fox News, sir.   For those of us who try to make a living out of parsing these statements noted that in the section on strains in global financial markets, the Committee  said this time around, \u201cS trains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.\u201d   But in January, the Committee  said that the strains were easing .  What are we to read into this apparent change?  A re strain s tightening now ?  And what is your assessment of the situation in Europe with the debt crisis \u2014are authorities there adequately addressing the debt  crisis ?  Thank you\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, it\u2019 s just supposed to be a factual description of what \u2019s happe ning in the environment .  In January , the financial markets had calmed  considerably , reflecting a number of steps taken in Europe , including , notably , the two  large long- term refinancing operations by the European Central Bank, which helped finance Europe \u2019s banks for up to three years .  In recent weeks, we \u2019ve seen more market stress arising from concerns about the fiscal positions of Spain and Italy , and, you know, we \u2019ve seen more volatility in our own markets related to that .  So we \u2019re simply taking note of the fact that a portion of the improvement that we saw late last year and early this year in European financial markets and in our own financial markets has been reversed recently, nothing more intended than that .  As you know, I had the opportunity over the weekend to speak with many of my European and other international colleagues because we had the G \u201320 and the IMF meetings here in Washington, and so we had plenty of opportunities to discuss the European situation.  I think it \u2019s true that the Europeans have made substantial progress overall .  I include not only the two  LTRO operations , April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    12 of 23  but also the Greek debt deal, the work on the fiscal compact, and recently the setting up of a larger financial firewall that could be used to avo id contagion should another country face serious financial distress .  So progress has been made, but obviously, judging by market conditions, there \u2019s still more work to be done , and we are counting on our European colleagues to continue to follow through t heir commitments and to put very strong effort into addressing what remain significant problems and concerns in Europe.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, two questions .  First, to follow up on Steve \u2019s point about the interest rate forecast earlier:  There are now only four FOMC participants who forecast that rates will still be close to zero at the end of 2014.  Given that you said the Committee  is entirely happy with that language in the statement, what information can we then take from the forecasts when they change like that ?  The second point \u2014sorry \u2014if you were to decide you wanted to do more to support the economy at some point, could you run us through the set of feasible options to do that ?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERN ANKE:  Sure .  Well, if you compare this set of forecasts with January, you\u2019ll  see that a few members have pulled in their expected date.  But let me just reiterate that, once again, that these are just inputs into a decision process .  They represent individual estimates , and , quite admittedly, as many of the participants said around the table, you know, these are uncertain from an individual point of view .  And as we discussed the range of considerations, including the fact that we remain uncertain about how the economy is going to evolve, I \u2019ve talked about, for example, the so- called Okun\u2019 s law puzzle about whether or not unemployment will continue fall quickly or whether it will begin to level out.  Given those uncertainties, given the risks like the  European situation or the fiscal cliff that we \u2019ve just discussed here , that there was a quite reasonable case for maintaining the guidance at late 2014 .  April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    13 of 23  And as I said, there was a great deal of comfort among the participants and the Committee  members with maintaining this guidance.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com .  Judging from some of the speeches lately from Fed officials, it looks like too- big-to-fail is \u2014they view this as the next step where attention should be paid and work should be done .  There \u2019s even a proposal to have legislation to force bank divestitures .  Could you talk about your views on these things ?  Thank you\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Yes .  I believe that too -big-to-fail was an important cause, or at least a propagating mechan ism, of the financial crisis .  And I believe it \u2019s absolutely incumbent upon us to do all we can to eliminate too- big-to-fail.  And what I mean by that is , a situation where a failing firm is bailed out because its collapse would have such adverse circumstance\u2014consequences for the rest of the financial system .  So we are working to get rid of too-big-to-fail, and I think making some progress .   First of all,  we are very substantially increasing the supervisory and regulatory oversight of large financial institutions ; that includes, for example, the Basel III rules that require higher capital for all banks but particularly for systemically important banks, mor e liquidity requirements , stress tests, a range of tougher supervisory requirements that are\u2014many of them are embedded in the rule we put out on 165\u2013166, that section of the Dodd\u2013 Frank Act .  So the first thing we \u2019re going to do is make sure that these larg e institutions are stronger , that it\u2019 s much harder for them to fail , and that they are watched much more carefully and more actively by the supervisors .   The other part of eliminating too -big-to-fail, though, is that , in that circumstance where a large co mplex financial firm does come to the brink of failure , that it must be allowed to fail; it April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    14 of 23  must be safe to fail.  And in that respect, one of the principal tools that we\u2019ve gotten from Dodd\u2013Frank is a so -called o rderly l iquidation a uthority, which is the FDIC\u2019s tool, and the Federal Reserve is working closely with the FDIC there .  The idea is to apply the same kind of bank resolution tools that the FDIC has used for many years on domestic banks to large complex financial firms .   Now, obviously, the comple xity and the international aspects of these firms make that a much more challenging task, but I think we \u2019re making progress there .  We have put out rules about so- called living wills, which will require large financial firms to essentially plan out how they would be disassembled .  And we \u2019ve continued to talk with international colleagues about how we would cooperate if a multinational firm had to be put into receivership.  And , indeed, part of the reason that there \u2019s been some downgrade or potential downgra de for some U.S. financial institutions is the judgment of the ratings agencies that the so -called implicit government support that these institutions have is less than in the past .  And so, I think, ultimately , what we\u2019 ll need to have is a situation where  large firms are both making judgments about their size and complexity based only on the economic benefits and costs and not on too-big-to-fail considerations, and that if there is failure, that it can be done and achieved without highly adverse consequenc es for the financial system and the economy .

To follow up on the too-big-to-fail question, there has been acute discussion in recent months about calling for breaking up the banks even louder than before, even including some Fed officials .  And you just talked about the need to eliminate too- big-to-fail.  Of course, Dodd\u2013Frank \u2014that \u2019s the intent of it.  My question is twofold:  Do you agree ?  And is there an argument to be made for breaking up the banks ?  And is that something that the Fed should consider when weighing the importance of financial stability ?  And , sort of , to this earlier point that you made is, what in your view is the April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    17 of 23  litmus test that will allow us to know that we can achieve ending too -big-to-fail through Dodd\u2013Frank?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, there may be circumstances where a bank or financial institution is artificially large .  And in that context, if it were posing a severe threat to financial stability, then I suppose that considering breaking it up would be something that regulators should look at .  My own view , though, is th at a more market -responsive way to address this problem is to eliminate the incentive to be too -big-to-fail.  That is , to\u2014through tougher supervisory oversight, through higher capital requirements, through greater liquidity requirements, through restrictio ns on interconnectedness , et cetera, take away the benefits or force firms to internalize the costs of being large and complex .  And on the other side, as I was saying earlier, if we can safely unwind a failing firm, then we no longer have too- big-to-fail, obviously, and so I think that \u2019s a very, very important objective .  The test would be that the financial markets that lend to large firms base their bond spreads and what they \u2019re willing to pay for the stock of those firms solely on the risk- taking and on the business model of those firms and not on the fact that there \u2019s some anticipation of a government bailout .

Mr. Chairman, good to see you .  There\u2019 s been some concern in markets about what will happen to bond yields at the expiration of Operation Twist on June 30th and some speculation on what the Fed might do\u2014might need to do to keep downward pressure on yields .  Is that a concern that you share?  A nd do you and your colleagues feel the need not to disappoint these kinds of market expectations?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, to your last point, the purpose of monetary policy is to achieve our object ives of maximum employment and price stability , it\u2019s not to disappoint or April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    18 of 23  not disappoint investors .  So we will take actions based on those economic objectives and not try to achieve certain market outcomes .   There\u2019 s some disagreement, I think, about exac tly how balance sheet actions by the Federal Reserve affect Treasury yields and other asset prices .  The view that we have generally taken at the Fed , in which I think\u2014for which I think the evidence is pretty good, is that it\u2019 s the quantity of securities held by the Fed at a given time rather than the new purchases \u2014the flow of new purchases \u2014which is the primary determinant of interest rates .  And if that theory is correct, then at such time that our purchases come to an end, there should be relatively minim al effects on interest rates at that time .  And that , in fact , has been our \u2014generally our experience in previous episodes where we have launched a program and then allowed it to come to a natural end.   Of course, we \u2019ll continue to monitor the situation , and if we believe that financial conditions for whatever reason are inconsistent with our macroeconomic objectives, then we will act to fix that.  But , again, our expectation is that , at whatever point that the purchases end, that financial markets being qu ite forward looking will have anticipated that, and that the effects ought to be moderate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Chairman.  I am Akio Fujii from Nikkei  newspaper .  My question is follow -up for your comment about Japan and U.S .  Now, are you confident U.S. economy would avoid long -term stagnation like we had in Japan, or so- called Japanization ?  And if it\u2019s the case, only policy response make a difference of Japan and U.S., or are there any other factor make difference?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNA NKE:  The last part again \u2014are there measures?

The first is that, as I mentioned earlier \u2014and I think this is very important \u2014is that we acted aggressively and preemptively to avoid deflation.  Now, of course , Japan had a much bigger bubble and a much bigger shock when the bubble collapsed , and so these differences may be certainly understandable .  But, again, we did avoid deflation .  The other thing which I think we have done reasonably well here in the United States was that we moved fairly quickly to make sure that our banks were recapitalized and were recognizing their bad assets .  And I think the stress tests that we conducted last month are good evidence that the U.S. banking system is considerably stronger and, indeed , much more resilient than it was a couple of years ago .   So those two things are positives and would tend to suggest that we will avoid some of the problems that Japan has faced .  That being said, I think it \u2019s always better to be humble and just to, you know , avoid being too confident .  And we need to continue to maintain a strong monetary policy support to make sure that the economy continues on a recovery path and returns to a more normal situation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Scott Spoerry with CNNMoney, sir .  I wante d to ask you about the labor force participation rate .  It\u2019s at the lowest level since the early \u2019 80s.  Can you talk about why people are dropping out of the job market, whether it \u2019s a permanent structural problem , and what convinces you that things may ch ange?  If I could just a pop a second question to follow up on Steve and the bonds \u2014your colleague Sheila Bair wrote this week that her \u2014about her concern April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    20 of 23  over being in a bond bubble .  She said you should declare victory, and you should do something about puncturing that bubble before it gets too much out of control .  Can you respond to that too?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  On declaring victory, I think it \u2019s a little premature to declare victory .  I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our e conomy .  As for the bond bubble, interest rates are low for a lot of reasons ; they include monetary policy , of course , but they also include a weak economy, low inflation expectations , and safe -haven demands for U.S. T reasuries .  So, of course , interest rates will rise at some point.  We hope that they do because that would be an indication that the economy is recovering and strengthening .  And I think it \u2019s important for holders of long -term securities to manage their risks and pay attention to that .  But all that being said, I think , again , that there are both good reasons to continue monetary ease and good reasons for interest rates to be low .  The f irst part of your question was \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: About the \u2014\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Oh, participatio n, labor participation, yes .  Actually , we had a very good discussion of that at the meeting be cause it is an important issue , trying to assess how much of the change in employment is structural, how much is cyclical , and so on.  There is , in fact , a downw ard trend in labor participation in the United States .  It comes from , first , the fact that we \u2019re no longer getting increased participation from women; f emale participation has leveled out .  And , secondly , because, as the society ages , and also for other reasons, male participation has been declining over  time .  So there is a downward trend that we have to take into account .   The participants at the meeting, at least some of them , suggested, though, that a good bit of the decline in participation that we \u2019ve seen in the last few years does represent cyclical April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    21 of 23  factors .  Much of it is young people , for example, who presumably are not out of the labor force indefinitely , but, given the weak job market, they are going to school or doing something else rather than working .  So one possibility and one reason why the unemployment rate may not fall as quickly going forward is that as the economy strengthens, as the labor market strengthens, many of these folks are going to come back in the labor force looking for wor k, which I think would be a good thing .  But we \u2019ll just have to see .  But I do think\u2014 I think I would agree with the argument that a significant part of the decline over and above the downward trend in the participation rate is reflecting cyclical factors a nd should reverse when the economy gets stronger . \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Don Lee f rom the L.A. Times .  Can you give us your assessment of the impact of the mild winter weather on job growth and what that might mean going forward?  And related to that, I think you sai d last month that some of the recent job gains reflected a catch -up from outsize cuts right after the recession .  I mean, given those two things, what kind of job growth can we expect?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, the weather issue just reflects how difficult it can be to make real -time assessments of the state of the economy .  The weather has probably affected a number of things .  It probably brought forward some of the hiring so that it made perhaps January and February artificially strong and March perhaps artificially a little bit weak .  It probably affected construction, manufacturing .  There\u2019 s a number of things that were probably affected to some extent by the unusually warm weather that we had this winter , and we \u2019re doing our best to try to adjust for that .  We \u2019re also looking at some of the seasonality issues that have arisen because of the unusually large recession in 2008 and 2009.  So , again, that makes the data harder to interpret .   April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    22 of 23  I advance d the hypothesis that the increase in employment we \u2019ve seen in the last five, six months might to some extent be greater than we\u2019d expect going forward because it represented a one-time catch -up, undoing the very sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009.  That \u2019s only a hypothesis .  We\u2019ll have to see going forward .  If it\u2019s correct , then job gains will be somewhat less than the 250,000 a month that we \u2019ve been seeing recently .  But we don\u2019 t know yet , we don\u2019 t know yet .  And I wouldn\u2019 t draw too much conclusion from the March report .  I think, again , because of weather and ot her factors, we really can \u2019t take a conclusive result from that.  So, we \u2019ll continue to be watching the labor market .  That \u2019s a very important consideration.

We need fewer jobs monthly to keep unemployment consistent or stable than in the past \u2014I suppose more like 100,000 a month for stability .  I don\u2019 t have an exact answer, but broadly speaking, 150\u2013200,000 jobs or so.  But that \u2019s a very rough estimate, and , of course, individual participants ma y have different views .   Again, that \u2019s not a forecast, I \u2019ve made a hypothesis, which would imply slower improvement in unemployment .  But the possibility , of course , exists that this recovery will generate a virtuous circle with greater hiring, which in t urn generates more consumer spending , and greater hiring , and so on.  That remains to be seen , and , of course , which way that goes is going to be a very important determinant of our response.

So, your particular suggestion is on the table , as are other ways to try to make this more useful .  And, again, it \u2019s a wor k in progress , as I said before .   The most frustrating aspect, I guess, of the recovery has been that it \u2019s\u2014has been that it \u2019s been quite slow .

The Committee's projections indicate that the economy has been expanding moderately and they expect moderate growth to continue in the coming quarters.Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector's ongoing weakness is still hindering economic recovery. While strains in global financial markets are less severe than last fall, they still pose significant risks to the outlook.The FOMC anticipates that inflation will remain at or below their goal of 2 percent. Participants' projections show inflation ranging from 1.7 to 2.0 percent for 2014.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Is the Committee now any closer to QE3 than it was at its last meeting?\n'ANSWER': The Committee has been bold and aggressive in easing monetary policy, maintaining the federal funds rate close to zero since 2008, implementing two rounds of quantitative easing, and offering guidance on the federal funds rate until late 2014. They remain prepared to do more if necessary to ensure the recovery continues and inflation stays close to target.", "'QUESTION': Do you see a risk that the disinflationary forces in the economy might not be as strong as the Fed had been projecting for some time?\n'ANSWER': Our projections still have inflation very close to our 2 percent target. Some recent movement in inflation seems to have come from transitory sources, and the fundamentals of inflation suggest that it will stay close to or below our target. The recent rise in gasoline prices is temporary and inflation should moderate to about 2 percent later this year.", "'QUESTION': Why did the lower bound in those forecasts rise?\n'ANSWER': The lower bound rose because the data has been a little bit firmer and core inflation has been stronger than expected. However, these differences are not significant.", "'QUESTION': How much more weakness would you need to see for QE3 to be in place? Would you need to see an actual recession take place?\n'ANSWER': Our intention is to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for the foreseeable future, and we remain able and willing to take further action if necessary. If the data were to come in much stronger than expected, we would adjust the guidance appropriately. The decision on QE3 would depend on how the outlook evolves.", "'QUESTION': How much more weakness would you need to see for QE3 to be in place?

The Committee had no difficulty coming to a consensus that the guidance is still appropriate. If there is a substantial change in the economic outlook, the guidance would change accordingly.", "'QUESTION': Do you worry about creating confusion in the market between the guidance and the individual forecasts?\n'ANSWER': The Committee decision is the critical element, and the individual projections are inputs to that decision. The Committee is working to become more transparent and is looking at various measures. However, the Committee was comfortable with the consensus reported today.", "'QUESTION': Why are you not using additional tools to address high unemployment when inflation is under control?\n'ANSWER': Our current views are consistent with my previous views on the Bank of Japan. The difference is that Japan was in deflation and recession, while the US is not. We have already taken significant measures to support the economy, and actively seeking higher inflation would be reckless and risk our credibility for low and stable inflation.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the Fed has to take into account when Congress chooses to take action on the fiscal cliff?\n'ANSWER': The Fed will have to consider fiscal policy to some extent, but if no action is taken by Congress, the size of the fiscal cliff is too large for the Fed to offset. Congress needs to achieve fiscal sustainability while also not endangering the short-term economic recovery.", "'QUESTION': What caused the downgrade in the growth forecast for 2013 and 2014 when there is an expected pickup in the economy after the coming quarters?\n'ANSWER': The downgrade in the forecast for 2013 and 2014 is based on the views of the participants. However, the overall projection still indicates that growth is likely to pick up over time. The expected pickup is due to accommodative monetary policy and the hope that some of the factors hindering the recovery will improve. The slight downgrade in years further out may be due to fiscal issues.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain why going above the 2 percent inflation target would hurt the Fed's credibility and what impact it would have on unemployment?\n'ANSWER': The inflation target is not a ceiling, but a symmetric objective to bring inflation close to 2 percent. If inflation were to run well above 2 percent for a long time, it could erode the credibility of the Fed and its ability to use accommodative monetary policy to achieve employment goals. There is no presumption that inflation needs to be above target to make progress on unemployment.", "'QUESTION': What is the apparent change in the statement regarding strains in global financial markets and what is the assessment of the situation in Europe with the debt crisis?\n'ANSWER': The statement is a factual description of the current environment. In January, the financial markets had calmed due to steps taken in Europe, but recent market stress has arisen from concerns about the fiscal positions of Spain and Italy. Progress has been made in Europe, but more work needs to be done to address significant problems and concerns.", "'QUESTION': What information can we take from the forecasts when only four FOMC participants forecast rates close to zero at the end of 2014? What are the feasible options to support the economy further?\n'ANSWER': The forecasts are individual estimates and represent inputs into the decision process. Uncertainties about the economy and risks like the European situation and fiscal cliff justify maintaining the guidance at late 2014. Feasible options to support the economy further were not discussed.", "'QUESTION': What are your views on too-big-to-fail and the proposal for bank divestitures?\n'ANSWER': Too-big-to-fail was a cause of the financial crisis, and it is important to eliminate it. We are increasing oversight of large financial institutions and implementing stricter regulations. We also have an orderly liquidation authority to handle the failure of large complex firms. The goal is for firms to make decisions based on economic factors, not too-big-to-fail considerations, and for failure to have minimal adverse consequences.", "'QUESTION': What is the assessment of the Federal Reserve on their efforts to improve communication with both markets and the general public?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve believes they are making progress in improving communication by clarifying their inflation objective, expanding projections, conducting press conferences, giving testimonies and speeches, and teaching classes. They aim to make the Fed more understandable to the average person and to better communicate with markets for appropriate reflection of monetary policy plans.", "'QUESTION': What would the federal funds rate be if it were not constrained by the zero nominal bound? Do you believe that you are providing an equivalent degree of monetary accommodation with unconventional tools? Can you provide some numbers on the meaning of \"exceptionally low\" federal funds rate?\n'ANSWER': The exact reading for the federal funds rate without the zero lower bound would depend on the model used, but it would likely be negative. We are using nonstandard tools, such as a large balance sheet, to compensate for this. Based on our analysis, monetary policy is currently in the right place, but we are prepared to take further action if needed.", "'QUESTION': What is the current reading for the federal funds rate and how does it compensate for the absence of the zero lower bound?\n'ANSWER': The exact reading of the federal funds rate would likely be negative without the zero lower bound. To compensate for this, nonstandard tools like a $3 trillion balance sheet are being used. The current monetary policy is considered to be in the right place, but further action is possible. The term \"exceptionally low\" is intentionally vague to accommodate different views among FOMC members. Chairman Bernanke believes it means close to the current rate.", "'QUESTION': Is there an argument for breaking up banks to eliminate too-big-to-fail and should the Fed consider this when weighing financial stability?\n'ANSWER': Breaking up artificially large banks may be considered if they pose a severe threat to financial stability. However, a more market-responsive approach is to eliminate the incentive to be too-big-to-fail through tougher oversight, higher capital and liquidity requirements, restrictions on interconnectedness, and internalizing the costs of being large. The goal is for financial markets to base their assessments solely on risk-taking and business models, without anticipating government bailouts.", "'QUESTION': Is the expiration of Operation Twist and the potential increase in bond yields a concern for the Fed?\n'ANSWER': The Fed's main objective is to achieve maximum employment and price stability, not to cater to market expectations. The Fed believes that the quantity of securities held by the Fed, rather than new purchases, is the primary determinant of interest rates. Therefore, the end of purchases should have minimal effects on interest rates, as seen in previous episodes. The Fed will continue to monitor the situation and take action if necessary.", "'QUESTION': Are you confident the U.S. economy will avoid long-term stagnation like Japan?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman asks for clarification on whether there are measures that can make a difference in avoiding long-term stagnation in the U.S. economy, in addition to policy responses.", "'QUESTION': Is policy response the only factor that differentiates the situations of the U.S. and Japan?\n'ANSWER': The U.S. acted aggressively and preemptively to avoid deflation, unlike Japan. Additionally, the U.S. quickly recapitalized its banks and addressed bad assets, making the banking system stronger. However, it is important to remain humble and maintain strong monetary policy support for the economy to continue recovering.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk about why people are dropping out of the job market, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a permanent structural problem, and what convinces you that things may change? Can you respond to concerns about a bond bubble?\n'ANSWER': Keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy. Interest rates are low due to monetary policy, weak economy, low inflation expectations, and safe-haven demands for U.S. Treasuries. Rising interest rates would indicate economic recovery. It is important for holders of long-term securities to manage risks, but there are good reasons to continue monetary ease and keep interest rates low.", "'QUESTION': What is the trend in labor participation in the United States and how much of it is due to cyclical factors?\n'ANSWER': There is a downward trend in labor participation in the United States, with decreased participation from women and declining male participation due to aging and other reasons. Some of the decline in participation in recent years is due to cyclical factors, such as young people choosing to go to school or do something else instead of working. This decline may reverse as the economy strengthens.", "'QUESTION': Can you give us your assessment of the impact of the mild winter weather on job growth and what that might mean going forward? And related to that, what kind of job growth can we expect given the recent job gains and catch-up from recession cuts?\n'ANSWER': The mild winter weather has likely affected hiring, making January and February artificially strong and March weak. It has also impacted construction and manufacturing. Additionally, the recent job gains may be a one-time catch-up from layoffs in 2008 and 2009, so future job growth may be somewhat less than what we have seen. However, it is still uncertain and we cannot draw conclusions from the March report. The labor market will continue to be closely monitored for policy considerations.", "'QUESTION': What kind of job growth, on average, is consistent with the unemployment projections that you've made?\n'ANSWER': Estimates differ, but to keep unemployment stable, we would need fewer jobs monthly than in the past, around 100,000. Broadly speaking, 150-200,000 jobs would be needed for stability, but this is a rough estimate and individual participants may have different views. It is possible that the recovery could generate a virtuous circle of greater hiring and consumer spending, but this remains to be seen.", "'QUESTION': Would the Fed consider attaching names to projections to improve transparency?\n'ANSWER': The Fed's subcommittee is looking at ways to improve transparency, including attaching names to projections. The recovery has been frustratingly slow, with the unemployment rate still over 8%. The hope is that as headwinds lift and housing improves, there will be more rapid improvement in the economy and labor market."]}
