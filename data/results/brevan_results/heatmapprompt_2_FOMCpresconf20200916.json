"question_answer": [["\nREPORTER: Good afternoon , Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal .  Yo u\u2019ve been very clear about the C ommittee \u2019s intention on rates, not even thinking about thinking about raising rates , and today showing low rates even as unemployment falls  to 4 percent  and inflation rises to 2  percent .  My question is about asset purcha ses.  Does the guidance today apply t o the current asset purchase pace ?  Are there any macroeconomic conditions under which you would favor increasing the  monthly pace of Treasury and MB S purchases?  And under what conditions would a decrease in the monthl y pace of purchases be appropriate?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thank you.  So we say in our postmeeting statement that we\u2019 ll continue to increase our securities holdings \u201c at least at the current pace\u201d  over coming months \u201c to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.\u201d   That latter part is an updating of our guidance to reflect what I \u2019ve been saying in these press conferences for some time and what other central banks have acknowledged, which is that the purchases ar e fostering accommodative  financial conditions as well.  That amounts to roughly $80 billion a month of T reasuries and $40 billion net per month for MB S.   So we do \u2014we do  think that these purchases have been effective in , in restoring  orderly market conditions and have supported the flow of credit to households and businesses, including by fostering more accommodative financial conditions , which , of course , we think is a good thing.  So , in terms of going forward, I would just say this :  There  are various ways an d margins that we can adjust our  tools going forward, and we \u2019ll continue to monitor developments.  And we\u2019re prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could\u2014if I could  follow up, I suppose the question I have is, why give guidance on one policy tool but not give guidance on the other policy tool when the Fed has talked about those two policy tools working together?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we, we think our \u2014we think our  policy stance is appropriate today, and we \u2019re prepar ed to adjust it going forward as we, as we see appropriate.  And today we believe that particularly this very strong forward guidance \u2014very powerful forward guidance that we\u2019ve announced today will provide strong support for the economy.  Effectively , we\u2019re saying that rates will remain highly accommodative until the economy is far along in its recovery, and that, that  should be a very powerful statement in supporting economic activity.  Now we \u2019re buying $120 billion in securities per month across the \u2014across the  Treasury curve.  That \u2019s also adding to accommodation.  We do have the flexibility to adjust that tool and, and the  rate tool and, and  other tools as well.  But as for right now, we think\u2014we think  that our policy setting is appropriate to support the ex pansion.  We  did\u2014we  said from the beginning that we would first try to provide some support and stability and relief in the first phase of the crisis, the acute phase, a nd then we would support the expansion when it came.  Well, it \u2019s here.  And it\u2019s well a long.  And so that \u2019s why we changed our guidance today, and we do have the flexibility to do more when we think it \u2019s appropriate.  \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.   Thanks for t aking my question.  Jeanna Smiale k, New York Times.  I was wondering, you beefed up your language on financial stability in the long- run statement  that you unveiled with your Jackson Hole speech last month.  I \u2019m wondering if you could kind of walk us through how you think about financial stability concerns as a factor in guiding and interpreting increases.  You know, would financial stability concerns on their own be enough to merit changes in the f ed funds rate?  Or would they have to come in conjunction with an overheating on inflation or some sort of dramatic drop in the unemployment rate?  If you could, sort of , give us an outline of your thinking there, please\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So what we said in our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals and Monetar y Policy Strategy was that the C ommittee \u2019s policy decisions reflect \u201c its longer -run goals, its medium -term outlook, and its assessment [s] of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that coul d impede the at tainment of the C ommittee \u2019s goals.\u201d   So that \u2019s what we said about financial stability.  And today we said that we \u2019d \u201cbe prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee\u2019s ] goals.\u201d  But you asked specifically about , about  financial stability.  One thing I would say is that financial \u2014that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense \u2014is not the first line of defense on financial stability.   We look to more appropria te tools in the first instance as a first line of defense , and those would be regulation, supervision, high capital, high liquidity , stress testing \u2014all of those things, macroprudential tools.  All of those things are, are really the first line of defense o n financial stability.  But we always leave open the idea that we will not ignore   those kinds of risks and other kinds of risks , more broadly, that could impede the attainment of our goals in, in setting  monetary policy.  So that\u2019s , that\u2019s  really how we think about it , but principally that, you know, other tools are the \u2014are the frontline , as I mentioned.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Just to follow up quickly, if, if other tools aren \u2019t forthcoming, would financial stability concerns in and of themselves  be enough to warrant a rate hike?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , you know, what we said again  in the [Statement on] L onger -Run [Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy] \u2014you know, in our consensus statement is that we, you know \u2014\u201cpolicy decisions reflect \u2026 the balance of ri sks, including risks to the financial system that coul d impede the attainment of the C ommittee \u2019s goals.\u201d   So the test would be, you know, does a majority of the C ommittee feel that , that  monetary policy is , is triggering that?  And that , that would be \u2014that  would be  the test.  And , you know, it \u2019s not something that we \u2019ve done.  We do monitor financial stability concerns , of course , intensely and regularly.  We try to use our other tools on them, but we , we do keep them in mind as we think about monetary policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you could help me unde rstand how the projections of the C ommittee  line up with the goals of the C ommittee.  You\u2019ve now altered the projections to\u2014the statement to aim for inflation above 2 percent .  But when I look at the SEP, I don\u2019t see the C ommittee believing  a single year in the next four years that you are ever above 2 percent .  In fact, for each year, you are below it until 2023, which is the first time that you actually hit 2  percent .  So do you think\u2014are, are you confident \u2014is this just the C ommittee is not confident that not only can it not hit its 2  percent  goal, but that now it can \u2019t hit its goal of being above 2 percent ? \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Not at all.  And, you know, you don\u2019t \u2014you also don \u2019t see people , by and large , lifting off or raising interest rates above zero.  I guess there are 4 exceptions out of a Committee o f 17 during that \u2014during the forecast period .  So we don\u2019 t reach 2  percent , but we get very close to it in the forecast.  We reach 2  percent \u2014I guess the median is 2  percent  at the end of 2023.  So , you know, you know what the guidance says.  It says that we expect that the current setting of , of our r ates will be\u2014what we  expect  [is] that it will be appropriate until such time as we reach 2  percent  inflation , that we feel that labor market conditions are consistent with our assessment of maximum employment, and that we \u2019re on track to achieve inflation moderate \u2014inflation moderately above.   So that \u2019s the test.   So I don\u2019 t think there \u2019s any conflict between those two because, you know, the , the way they\u2019re set up, the  projections don\u2019 t show the out years.  You asked about confidence, and I would say that thi s, this  very strong, very powerful guidance shows both our confidence and our determination.  It shows our confidence that we can reach this goal and our determination to do so.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: I \u2019m sorry, if I could just follow up without  being simplistic about this.  But why wouldn\u2019t \u2014if the C ommittee was confident that it could reach its new goal of aiming for inflation above 2 percent , why wouldn\u2019 t one of those years at least show inflation being above 2 percent  on the median forecast\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Because it \u2014we think, looking at everything we know about inflation dynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades, we expect it will take some time.  We expect that the economy will recover quickly now, but that that pace will slow as, as people go back to work.  And we \u2019ll still have an area of the economy \u2014a big area of the economy\u2014that struggles.  There will be slack in the economy.  The economy will be below   maximum employment, below full demand.  And that will tend to wear \u2014to put downward pressure on inflation.  So we think that once we get up closer to maximum employment, we think that inflation will come back , generally.  And , I mean, that \u2019s sort of what happened during the last long expansion.  It \u2019s a slow process, but \u2014but  there is a process there.   Inflation does move up over time.  We do expect that will continue today, a nd we expect that our , our guidance is powerful and will help that outcome.  We think that \u2014that  effectively saying that policy will remain highly accommodative unt il the economy is very far along in its recovery should provide strong support for the economy and get us there sooner rather than later.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  I wanted to ask if you anticipate a slowing in the pace of the recovery if there is not another stimulus package  and, specifically, if there are particular holes still remaining in the economy that you think could be helped by more aid from Congress.  Thanks very much\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sur e.  So, first, if you look at the Summary of Economic P rojections that my colleagues and I filed for this meeting, what you\u2019 ll see is an expectation that the recovery will continue \u2014that it will continue at a reasonable pace through 2021, \u2019 22, and \u2019 23.  We do expect that that pace will slow just because you would expect that the, the pace w ould be fastest right at the beginning of the \u2014right at the beginning of the recovery, because  you had such a sharp decline.  You would expect that the third quarter should be  the fastest gains, and that , after that, the pace should slow down to a more norm al pace.  So we do expect that.  In terms of fiscal policy \u2014you asked about fiscal policy.  So , you know, one thing\u2014 I guess I would start by saying that the initial response from fiscal authorities was rapid.   It was   forceful and pretty effective.  And we \u2019re seeing the results of that in \u2014today in income and household spending data, in the labor market data, in the construction data, in the data for business equipment spending, and the fact that businesses are staying in business, and , you know, the pace of de fault and things like that has really slowed.  So there \u2019s been a really positive  effect.  That said, my sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed.   Of course, the details of that  are for Congress, not for the F ed.  But I would just say, there  are still roughly 11 million people still out of work due to the pandemic, and a good part of those people were working in industries that are likely to struggle.  Those people may need additional , additional  support as they try to find their way through what will be a difficult time for them.  We\u2019ve also got struggling small businesses, especially those in the business of facing directly to the public.  And we have state and local governments dealing with a drop in revenue at the same time spending has gone up, much of it related to the pandemic and economic effects.  So , again, I would say, the fiscal support has been essential in , in the good progress we see now. And, finally, I\u2019 ll note that just about all\u2014 the overwhelming majority of , of private forecasters who, who project an ongoing recovery are assuming there will be substantial additional fiscal support.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: [Inaudible] t aking my question.  Should we e xpect any further evolutions in forward guidance, say , maybe an adoption of something akin to the Evans r ule that  we had a few years ago?  Or is  there something else that the F ed might be considering in the future?  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, s o we think that the  forward guidance we adopted today is appropriate and, as I mentioned, powerful.  Effectively, what it says is that we\u2019ll, we will  keep policy where it is now \u2014keep the rate policy where it is now until unemployment reaches the Committee \u2019s assessments or levels that are\u2014sorry, not unemployment , labor market conditions reach levels that are consistent with the Committee \u2019s assessments of maximum employment , until inflation reaches 2  percent , and until it \u2019s on track to go above 2 percent  moderately for some time.   So that \u2019s very strong forward guidance, and we think that that will be durable guidance that will provide significant support to the economy in coming years.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  really our thinking on, on  forward guidance on rate s\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks.  Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this.  So to follow  up on Mike \u2019s question there , since you described this guidance as durable, you\u2014you\u2019ve  set up a three -part test here for rate h ikes:  levels consistent with assessments of maximum employment, inflation has risen to 2  percent,  and you\u2019 re on track to moderately exceed 2 percent  for some time.  Each of these have modifiers, and I wonder if you could explain them a little bit more.  How do we pin down assessments of maximum employment?   When you say that \u201c inflation has risen to 2  percent ,\u201d does that mean 2  percent  for a day, a month, six months?   And when you say \u201con track to moderately exceed,\u201d  how should we define \u201c moderately \u201d?  And how should we define \u201c for some time \u201d\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, as you know, maximum employment is not \u2014is not  something that can be reduced to a number the way inflation can.  It\u2019s a broad range of factors.  It really always has been and , really , a substantial number of factors that we\u2019ve indicated we would look at.  So it\u2019s broader labor conditions , consistent with our Committee\u2019s assessment of maximum   employment.  So that would certainly mean low unemployment , it would mean high labor force participation , it would mean wages \u2014it would be a whole range of things .  And we \u2019re not looking at a rule.  We \u2019re looking at a judgmental assessment , which I think we \u2019ll be very transparent about as we \u2014as we go forward.  In terms of inflation, you know, this is a C ommittee that is both confident and committed to\u2014and determined to reach our goals.  And the idea that we would look for the , the quickest way out is just \u2014it\u2019s just  not who we are.  It\u2019s not that\u2014t here\u2019s no message of that here.  We would not be looking for one month of 2 percent  inflation ; we said return to 2\u2014to achieve 2 percent  inflation.  Okay .  So just understand that, you know, we \u2019re strongly committed to achieving our goals and the overshoot.  So that should tell you about that.  Oh, in terms of \u2014okay, in terms of \u2014so, what does \u201c moderate \u201d mean?  It means not large.   It doesn\u2019t \u2014it means not very high above 2 percent .  It means moderate.  I think that\u2019 s a fairly well-understood word.  In terms of \u2014in terms of  \u201cfor a time, \u201d what it means is not permanently and not for a sustained period.  You know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  resisting the urge to try to create some sort of a rule or a formula here.  And I think the, the public  will understand pretty well what we want.  It\u2019 s actually prett y straightforward.  We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent  over time.  And if we do that, inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent, and that \u2019ll help us achieve 2  percent  inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its ability to support the economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks for taking the question.  James Politi with the Financial Times .  Do you consider today\u2019 s enhanced forward guidance to have actual accommodation to the \u2014to the U.S. economy from a monetary perspective  and sort of deliver further support  for the   economy?   Or is it just a tweak to your existing policy stance?  And , in terms of fiscal support, do you assume in your own projections \u2014not just , you know, private forecasters\u2014that additional fiscal support will be forthcoming?  Or do you expect weaker  growth or a \u2014or a  larger contraction rather this year if no fiscal support is forthcoming?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , in terms of the effects, so  I think what we\u2019ve done  is\u2014is more or less aligned with the consensus statement today.  So it \u2019s, it\u2019s in line with what , what  might have been expected.  As I mentioned, I think over time it will provide very powerful support for this economy as we move forward.  In a sense, it \u2019s consistent with expectations, so I don \u2019t\u2014I\u2019m not looking for a big reaction right now.  But I think , over time, again, guidance that we expect to retain the current stance until the economy  is\u2014has moved very far toward our goals is a strong and powerful t hing.  And I think that will be supportive of the economy over time.  In terms of additional fiscal support, I guess your question is, what would happen if \u2014yes, so, people have different assessments, and, and different participants in the FOMC made different assessments on their own.   I think broadly, though, there is an expectation among private forecasters and among FOMC participants that there will be some further fiscal action.   And there does seem to be an appetite on the part of all the relevant players to doing something.  The question is, how much and when?  And so I would just say that if \u2014and it \u2019s very hard to say.  So , so far the economy has proven resilient to the \u2014to the  lapsing of the \u2014to the, of the  CARES Act unemployment \u2014enhanced unemployment benefits.  But there \u2019s, there\u2019s  certainly a risk , though, that , that  those who are unemployed have saved\u2014appear to have saved some of those benefits, a nd they \u2019ll, they\u2019ll  now spend them , and that , as the months pass, if , if there \u2019s no follow -up on that, if there isn\u2019t additional support and there isn \u2019t a job for the \u2014some of those people who are, are  from   industries where , where  it\u2019s going to be very hard to find new work, then you\u2019ll \u2014that will start to show up in economic activity.  It\u2019ll also show up in things like evictions and foreclosures and, and, you know, things that will scar and damage the economy.  So that \u2019s a downside risk.  So I, I think the real question is, is, when and how much and what will be the \u2014what will be the  contents ?  And , you know, no one \u2014no one  has any certainty around that, but , broadly speaking, if we don\u2019 t get that, then there would certainly be downside risks through the \u2014certainly through the channel I mentioned\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks for taking my question.  Chair man Powell, given the recent update to the policy framework and repeated calls for this in the Fed Listens  events, is the F ed open to other measures of the  economy, such as income inequality and affordability of housing?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we \u2014you know, we monitor everything we think is important in the U.S. economy.  And  in that \u2014in a broad sense, all of it goes into thinking about monetary policy.  You mentioned inequality.  So , you know, disparities in, in income and in financial well -being by various demographic and racial categories is something we monitor carefully.  Inequality, which I would point to\u2014 it\u2019s a multifaceted thing.   But I would point to the relative stagnation of incomes for people at the lower end of the income spectrum and also lower mobility.   So those are things that hold back our economy.  They are.  The thing is, we don\u2019 t really have the tools to address those.  We, we have interest rates and bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like that , but we can\u2019t \u2014we can\u2019t  get at those things through our tools.  When we lower the federal funds rate, that supports the economy across a broad range of , of people and activities, but we can\u2019t \u2014we don\u2019 t have the ability to target particular groups.    Notwithstanding that, we , we do talk about it , because these are important features of our economy.  And we \u2014you know, I , I think those are\u2014those distributional issue s are, are  issues that are really for our elected officials.  And I would say, I take them seriously as holding back our economy.  The productive capacity of the economy is limited when not everyone has the opportunity, has the educational background and , and the health  care and all the things that you need to be an active participant in our workforce.  So I think we can\u2014if we want to have the , the highest potential output and the \u2014and the  best output for our economy, we need that prosperity to be very broadly spread in the longer run. And I\u2014again, I would just say, the F ed\u2014you know, we can talk about those things a lot.  And in, in\u2014when we think about maximum employment in particular, we do look at individual groups.  So high unemployment in a particular racial group like African Americans  when \u2014you know, we would look at that as we think about whether we \u2019re really at maximum employment.  We would look\u2014we would look at that along with a lot of other data.  So the answer is, we do look at all those things and, and do what we can with our tools.  But , ultimately, these are issues for elected representatives.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Ye s, thank you, Chairma n Powell, for the question.  I just wanted some clarity here.   At what point do you think it\u2019 s prudent to shift the bond purchases from market stability \u2014as you had said, from the shorter -term maturities to more longer- term, more stimulus -related\n\nCHAIR POW ELL: So , you know, we think our \u2014we think that our asset purchases are doing both the thing\u2014both  those things today.  We think, clearly , there \u2019s been great progress , in terms of market function.  If you remember , early in the spring when the acute phase of  the   pandemic hit, market function was very low.  And it \u2019s improved rapidly and, and in many respects is , is in a good place now.  We also , though, think that these asset purchases, which total $120 billion a month\u2014you know, which is much larger than, for example , the last asset purchase program during the G lobal F inancial Crisis and the recovery therefrom \u2014we think that that \u2019s also providing accommodative financial conditions and supporting growth.  And we think that \u2019s fine.  We\u2019re also aware that we, we \u2014there are ways we can adjust that, you know, to do various things \u2014you know, make it smaller, make it larger, and also target different sectors of the\u2014of the  curve.  And , you know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  going to continue to monitor developments, and we\u2019re prepared  to adjust our plans as appropriate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to ask about a couple of things.  First of all, if we don \u2019t get a vaccine until well into next year,  what does that mean for the economy?   And then, somewhat related, I was wondering if you could provide any more detail about the stress scenarios that you all are going to release for the big banks and whether that is going to be another full -blown stress  test, whether we \u2019re going to publicly see those results, and what it might mean for bank payouts.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Great.   So, on the first one , what\u2019s happening is basically we \u2019re learning to live with \u2014right now , we're learning to live with COVID , which st ill spreads.  And we\u2019re learning to , to engage in economic activity.   All of this recovery that we \u2019ve seen is in a context where \u2014you know, where people are still at risk of , of catching it , and yet we \u2019re able to resume lots and lots of economic activities.   And that involves, as I mentioned, you know \u2014I think the more social distancing we can preserve as we go back into the workforce \u2014wearing masks, keeping our distance, that kind of thing\u2014the better we\u2019 ll be able to get economic activity   back up close to whe re it was.   I do think, though, there are areas of the economy that are just going to really struggle until we have an \u2014a vaccine that \u2019s, that\u2019s  in wide \u2014you know, wide usage and is , is widely trusted.  And those are the ones where  people were  getting really closely \u2014close together.  I also think testing \u2014to the extent you have cheap and rapid testing, you can do a lot with that in the workforce.  You can\u2014you can build confidence in the workforce if you have regular \u2014very regular testing that doesn\u2019 t cost very much and you get the results really quickly.  If you do that, you\u2019 ll be able to open a lot of workforces, particularly in cities where the overall case numbers are quite low.   And that will help a lot.  So I think we \u2019re, we\u2019re going to be finding lots and lots of ways to get out towards \u2014you know, as far as we can.  There \u2019s always going to be that \u2014for, for  some time, there\u2019 s going to be certain activities that will be \u2014that will be  hard to, to resume.   So I , I think that \u2019s the only way I can say it .  And I think trying to\u2014you know, we all \u2014when we make a forecast, we make assessments about that , but it\u2019s really hard to say.  There is no template here.  There \u2019s no\u2014you know, there\u2019s no experience with this.  So, frankly, for the last 60 days or so, the economy\u2019 s recovered faster than expected.  And that may continue or not.  We just don\u2019 t know.  And I think we should do those things that we control to make sure that we can recover as quickly as possible.  And the  main thing, again, is wearing a mask and keeping your distance while you\u2019 re in the workforce.  That \u2019s something we can all do that will limit the spread and let people go back to work, avoid major outbreaks , and things like that.    In, in terms of the str ess test s, so I really don \u2019t have any\u2014you know, we \u2019re getting ready quite soon to be making announcements and saying things publicly.  There \u2019s not much I can say with you\u2014nothing, really, that I can say that\u2019s \u2014on that today.  I don\u2019 t have anything for you\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle.  Good afternoon, Chair man Powell.  You have emphasized many times, including today, that the Fed can only lend and not spend, and sometimes the latter is what \u2019s really needed.   But to the extent that a $600 billion lending program for small and midsize companies could help, what exactly is wrong with the design or function of the Main Street Lending P rogram , which has purchase d just , I think , $1.4 billion in loans so far? Eric Rosengren at the  Boston Fed has said recently that Congress should clarify how much risk it wants the program to take.  But Congress has already appropriat ed substantial funds for the 13( 3) programs , and these are funds that are explicitly designed to absorb losses.  Meanwhile, my colleagues who cover the banking sector say they \u2019re being told by commercial banks that the Treasury Department is advising them to target zero losses \u2014zero losses in Main Street P rogram loans.  So , if I may, why is it that th e Federal Reserve, the Congress, and the Treasury apparently cannot agree on a loss tolerance that should  be applied to the Main Street Lending P rogram in a way that would allow badly needed credit to reach these companies?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So , a couple things about Main Street.  It , it reaches the whole nation.  It\u2019s got more than half of the banking industry assets signed up among the banks that are part of it, a nd it\u2019s making loans.  The number is more like \u2014it\u2019s close to $2 billion now.  So the numbers are going up.  Banks are joining;  borrowers are coming.  And it \u2019s significant.  It\u2019s , it\u2019s   relatively small now, but it can scale up in response to economic conditions, should that be \u2014should that be  appropriate.  You know, if you look out in the lending world, surveys generally find that , that  firms are not citing credit constraints as a top problem.   And that , that  is a lot of PPP, bank credit lines , and syndicated loans.  There \u2019s a lot of credit being let out the re. So\u2014but you\u2019 re right.  We , we are looking at some things.  We \u2019re looking at \u2014some lenders are concerned about the underwriting expectations.  So banks are going to\u2014their approach is likely to be that they \u2019re going to underwrite this loan roughly the same  as they underwrite any loan.  They \u2019re keeping part of it, and, you know, what , what  we want to do is make sure that \u2014that  they know that they should take the payment deferrals and other things in , in place, and also that \u2014you know, it \u2019s, it\u2019s really \u2014it\u2019s re ally a, a facility for , for companies or borrowers that, that  don\u2019 t have access to , to \u201c regular way \u201d borrowing now.  Otherwise, why would we need Main Street? So that \u2019s what we're working on.  And we \u2019ll be doing some , some \u2014we \u2019ll be making some changes in that respect.  I don\u2019t \u2014I saw what President Rosengren said.   I, I can\u2019t really comment directly on that.  I just woul d say that, you know, this is 13( 3).  If you look at the law under section 13(3), it\u2019s very clear that we are to make loans only to solvent borrowers.  And , and the CARES Act is quite specific in keeping all of the terms of , of section 13(3) in effect, including the requirement  that we, you know, gather good evidence that the borrower is solvent.  This was \u2014this la w was amended  in, you know , under \u2014in Dodd- Frank, and the idea was, was  to make it challenging and put hurdles in place before we made loans \u2014at the time, the thinking was to banks.  So now we \u2014now we \u2019re using that same law for , for smaller business borrowers, and , you know, it doesn\u2019t\u2014 it\u2019s not a perfect fit.   And , and, I would also just say , for many borrowers,   they\u2019 re in a situation where their business is still relatively shut down , and they won\u2019 t be able to service a loan, and so  they may need more fiscal support.  Having said that, we\u2019re , we\u2019re  continuing to work to , to improve Main Street, to make it more broadly available \u2014make it pretty much to any company that needs it and that can service a loan\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And can you just very briefly address the reports that the Treasury is advising banks to target zero losses?  Is that appropriate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I can \u2019t say.  I don\u2019t \u2014I don\u2019t  know about that.  I haven\u2019 t heard those reports.  You know, again, if you think about it , we, we weren \u2019t\u2014we\u2019re , we\u2019re  going to have to go through the banking system to do this.  We \u2014we \u2019re not going to have a hundred thousand or a million loan off icers working for the F ed and the Treasury.  So we \u2019re going to go through the banking system , and the banks \u2014banks  like to make good loans.  That \u2019s what they do.  They \u2019re trained to make good loans.  So you should expect that they\u2014 and we expect that they will do some underwriting.  We also want them to take some risk, obviously, because that was the poi nt of it.  And the question is, how do you dial that in?   It\u2019s, it\u2019s not an easy thing to do.  And , you know, we \u2019re getting some loans made , and we \u2019re hopeful that we \u2019ll, that we\u2019ll clarify this a nd that credit will continue to  flow.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, thanks for taking my question.  Chair Powell, you\u2019 ve talked a couple of times about parts of the economy that may not recover as fast as we \u2019ve seen so far.  Presumably you\u2019 re referring to airlines, hotels, ot her sections\u2014you know, parts of the economy that rely on close contact.  How are you thinking about that , in terms of its overall impact?  Is that sector large enough to say keep unemployment above \u2014you know, far above your maximum goals?   Are you expecting that to come back with a vaccine?   Or are a lot of   those folks going to have to find, you know, new jobs in new indust ries?  And should we expect the F ed will keep rates at zero until all of that reallocation is done?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes, we \u2014of  course, we can\u2019t be\u2014we can\u2019t be  really sure we know the answers to those questions.  But I would say, th e, the likely path is that the \u2014that the  expansion will continue.  And it\u2019s , as I said, it\u2019s well along, and it\u2019ll move most easily through the parts o f the economy \u2014it\u2019ll still take some time , but the parts of the economy that weren\u2019t exactly directly affected , that  didn\u2019t involve getting people in large groups together to feed them, to fly them around, to put them in hotels, do entertainment, things like that \u2014those are going to be the places that are \u2014that are  very challenging.  So there will also be  the\u2014you know, the places that are affected that way.  And that \u2019s going to be challenging for , for some time.  It just is.  And we don\u2019 t really know how long that will be.  It\u2019s\u2014you know, it \u2019s millions of people.  As I mentioned, we had 11 million\u2014something like 11 million people in the payroll survey have gone back to work out of 22 million who went \u2014who lost their jobs in March and April.  So that \u2019s half of the m.  So, 11 million \u2014particularly if the pace of , of returning to work slows down, it \u2019s going to leave a large \u2014a large group of people.  And it \u2019ll be very meaningful from a macroeconomic standpoint.  And our commitment is not to forget those people.  As I mentioned, we want \u2014you know, the sense of our forward guidance is that policy will remain , as we\u2019 ve said , highly accommodative until the \u2014until the  expansion is well along\u2014really , very close to our goals.  And even after , if we do lift off, we will keep pol icy accommodative until we actually have a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time.  So those are powerful commitments that we think will, will  support the full recovery, including those people , as long as it takes.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chair man, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  Based on what you were just saying about keeping policy accommodative for a very long time into the recovery, lower -for-longer as far out as three years in your latest  projections , is that basically it for the F ed?  In other words, since interest rates are your main tool, the things you can do would push down on interest rates.  But is it really \u2014is it the case now that the only additional stimulus that can come to the e conomy is from the fiscal side?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, no, I wouldn\u2019t \u2014I certainly would not say that we \u2019re out of ammo .  Not at all.   So, first of all, we , we do have lots of tools.  We\u2019ve got the lending tools , we\u2019ve got the balance sheet, and we\u2019 ve got further forward guidance \u2014further forward guidance.  So we, we \u2014there \u2019s still plenty more that we can do.  We do think that our \u2014that our, our  rate policy stance is an appropriate one to support the economy.  We think it \u2019s powerful.  And , as I mentioned, you know, this is the kind of guidance that will provide support for the economy over time, the idea being that policy will remain highly accommodative until the recovery is well along\u2014really , very close to our goals \u2014and then will remain accommodative even aft er we lift off.  So I think that\u2019s , that\u2019s  a really strong place for , for rate policy to be.  But, again, we have the other margins that we can still use.  So , no.  C ertainly , we\u2019re not out of ammo.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Well, if I could follow up, in terms of t he balance sheet, are you concerned that your actions are more likely to produce asset price inflation than goods -and-services inflation?   In other words, are you risking a bubble on Wall Street?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, so, of course we monitor financial conditions very carefully.  These are\u2014these are not new questions.  These were questions that were very much in the air a decade ago and more when , when the F ed first started doing QE.  And , I would say, if you look at the long experience of, you know, the 10- year, 8 -month expansion, the longest in our   recorded history, it included an awful lot of quantitative easing and low rates for 7 years.   And , I would say, it was notable for the lack of  the emergenc e of, of some sort of a financial bubble \u2014a housing bubble or some kind of a bubble , the popping of which could threaten the expansion.  That didn\u2019 t happen.  And , frankly, it hasn\u2019 t really happened around the world since then.  That doesn\u2019 t mean that it won \u2019t happen, but \u2014and so, of course , it\u2019s something that we monitor carefully.  After the financial crisis, we started a new \u2014a whole division of the F ed to focus on financial stability.  We look at it in every\u2014from  every perspective.  The F OMC gets briefed on a quarterly basis.  At the B oard here , we talk about it more or less on an ongoing basis , so it is something we monitor.  But I don\u2019 t know that the \u2014that the  connection between asset purchases and, and financial stability is a particularly tight one.   So\u2014but again, we won\u2019t be \u2014we won \u2019t be just assuming that.  We \u2019ll be checking carefully as we go.  And , by the way, the kinds of tools that we would use to address those sorts of things are not really monetary policy.  It would be more tools that strengthen the  financial system.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Chair  Powell, I \u2019d like to ask you about the labor market.  As you know, in August there were about 30 million persons claiming unemployment benefits.  Yet the BLS jobs report for August showed about 13\u00bd  million unemployed, only about 6 million more than before the pandemic.  I wonder how you reconcile that and what you think the actual labor market conditions are.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , I mean, I think the overall picture \u2014take a step back from t his.  The overall picture is clear, and that is that the labor market has been recovering, but that it \u2019s a long way\u2014a long way from maximum employment.  I think that\u2019s , that\u2019s  the bottom line on it.     So, within that , though \u2014take claims in particular.  The number of claims, the quantity of claims , and, frankly,  the fact that PUA claims are new \u2014the P andemic U nemployment A ssistance claims\u2014that \u2019s a new system that had to be set up.  The actual counting of the claims is , is volatile , and , and it \u2019s very difficult to take much signal about the particular level.  So , you know, because people were setting those systems up, and when they got them set up, they counted them all at once and things like that.  I think , though, what you\u2019 ve seen is that the l evel of \u2014certainly the level of initial claims has declined very sharply from the very high levels of March and April and is now at a lower level \u2014continues either to be flat or gradually decline.  It\u2019s worth noting\u2014 and that \u2019s good\u2014it\u2019 s worth noting that tha t level is maybe five times the level of what claims were .  Claims were around 200,000; n ow they\u2019 re 900,000, in that range , weekly for , for initial claims.  So that just tells you, the labor market has improved, but it \u2019s a long, long way from maximum employment , and it will be some time getting back there.  I think that \u2019s the best way to think about it.  In many parts of the economy there \u2019s just a lot of disruption, and it\u2019s , it\u2019s really hard to say precisely where we are.  I\u2019ll give you another example with\u2014 you know, we say unemployment \u2019s 8.4 percent.  B ut if you count those who are \u2014who are  misidentified as, as  employed when they\u2019 re actually unemployed and you add back some part of the participation number \u2014so if you were \u2014if you had a job and you were in the labor force in February and you lost it because of the pandemic, some of you are now being reported as out of the labor force.  But I\u2014you know, I would\u2014I would more look at those people as unemployed.  If you add those back, the level of unemployment \u2019s pro bably 3 percent  higher.  On the other hand, by that metric, the , the   unemployment rate would have  been in the \u2014in the  20s in , in April.  So the improvement has been quite substantial under any measurement.  But the level is still quite high.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Well,  if I could follow up, i s\u2014is it the F ed\u2019s aim to get back to 3.5 percent  or even lower?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes, absolutely.  You know, I, I can\u2019t be precise about a particular number, but let me just say, there was a lot to like about 3 \u00bd percent  unemployment.  It\u2019 s not a magic number.  No one would say that number is the touchstone or that is, you know, maximum employment.  I would just say , you asked about 3 \u00bd percent .  A 3\u00bd percent  unemployment rate showed, you know, gains being shared very widely across the i ncome spectrum \u2014in fact, going more to people at the bottom end of the spectrum.  It showed labor force participation coming up  as\u2014up above many estimates of its trend , as people who \u2019d been out of the labor force were being pulled into a tight job market.  There \u2019s a lot to like about a tough\u2014a tight job market, particularly in a world where we didn \u2019t see inflation.   So, yes, we \u2019d love to get back to that.  I mean, I would say, we would like to get back\u2014 rather than to a particular number, we \u2019d like to get back  to a strong labor market where wages are moving up, where people can find work, where labor force participation is holding up nicely.  That \u2019s what we \u2019d really love to get back to.  Now, of course we would\u2014we need inflation to perform in line with , with  our framework.  But the good news is , we think we can have quite low unemployment without raising troubling inflation.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I  want to follow up on the wealth gap issue.  I know you were \u2014that you have limited   tools.  But are there things that you can do, possibly in the area of research and maybe expand your research on racial economic gaps?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, we do\u2014we are gifted with a , a subst antial group of researchers who  really cover the waterfront.  And we do a significant amount of research on racial disparities in \u2014across multiple variables, including wealth, as you asked  about.  So we do that.  And we also \u2014remember , we have our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs , which is present in communities around the country.  And the R eserve B anks all have very active community a ffairs groups.  They \u2019re present in communities around the country.  So it wasn \u2019t just the Fed \u2014Fed Listens  events.   It\u2019s more , just , over a long period of time we, we are in contact with people in those communities to understand their experience of the economy.  We serve all Americans, and we know that.  And we \u2019re going to use our tools to , to reflect that fact.  So the answer is \u201c yes.\u201d  We do quite a bit of research , and I suppose we could do more, but we really do a lot.  And we contribute to those fields and those assessments of , of the state of the economy.  And we do that not just becaus e it\u2019s interesting and important, but because it \u2019s important for the economy and important for our mandate. We are assigned \u201c maximum employment.\u201d   Now, what does that mean?  As I mentioned earlier, it doesn \u2019t mean a particular headline unemployment number.  What it means is maximum employment.  So , you know, we look at \u2014look at  that in many, many different variables, and we ask ourselves whether those variables are\u2014those labor market conditions are consistent with our assessments of what would constitute max imum employment.  And that would include all of the things that we \u2019re talking about.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Greg Rob b from MarketWatch.   Thanks for this.  I want to go back to the new forward guidance that you have.  And you said that it \u2019s powerful, but you\u2019ve  already have two dissent \u2014two dissenting voters on it.  And I was wondering if there \u2019s other , other  people who argued against it.  And what do you say to the two who dissented?  It look s like President Kashkari  wanted  a simpler forward guidance, and President Kaplan thought that the current guidance you have was fine for now.  So , like , how did you argue back on those , on those  arguments?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I wouldn\u2019 t\u2014I don \u2019t want to comment particularly on, on the two dissenters, b ut they, they consent \u2014they dissented from , of course , different perspectives, and, and that should be clear.  That\u2019s their \u2014they\u2019re not\u2014they \u2019re sort of on, on two sides of the , of the discussion.  But I would say this :  I am blessed wi th having a C ommittee of highly thoughtful people who bring diverse life experiences and diverse careers, and , of course , diverse views to our work.  And I wouldn\u2019 t have it any other way.  I wouldn\u2019 t.  So, so I would just say, the right \u2014in our discussions the last couple of days, the whole Committee, everybody on the Commi ttee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and what \u2019s in there \u2014very, very broad support , unanimous support for that.  Ever yone sees the, the  changes in the underlying economy and sees , in their own way, the need to address those \u2014and including the changes we made to the employment mandate and to inflation so that we\u2019re now  at flexible average inflation targeting.  Of course, there would be \u2014this is \u2014you know, we \u2019re the first major central bank to adopt this framework.  There \u2019s no cookbook, and we \u2014you know, this is the first guidance under our new framework.  So , of course there would be a wide range of views, and you would expect that.  And it \u2019s actually a healthy thing.  So I welcome that discussion.  I would also say this :  You   know, this is all about credibility , and we understand perfectly that we have to earn credibility.  This, this  facility \u2014this , this  framework has to \u2014we hav e to support it with our actions.  And I think today is a very good first step in doing that.  It is strong, powerful guidance.  It is\u2014it ties in very nicely with the Statement of [on ] Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy S trategy.  We had quite a robust discussion, and there are, there are different ideas on how to do this , but I\u2014that \u2019s just , that\u2019s just the way it is when you have a diverse group of highly thoughtful and effective people.  And so I \u2019m pleased with where it came out.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks so much for taking my question.  I wanted to ask about commercial real estate.   I, I know you had mentioned before how you weren\u2019t sure if there was a way the Fed  could support CRE borrowers.  But  I was just wondering if you had\u2014if you\u2019ve  had any other continuing discussions on that and if  there\u2019s any potential way that the F ed could step in in that area.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So thank you for that question.  You know, we \u2019ve actually spent quite a bit of time on this as Secretary Mnuchin, I think , mentioned the other day.  And I \u2019ll say just a couple things.  First, you know, our facilities are essentially always \u2014they have to be , under the law \u2014broad based and not so much targeting any single sector.  Also, it\u2019 s important to remember that CRE , commercial real estate, benefits from several of our existing facilities.  So the TALF takes commercial mortgage- backed securities and SBA commercial real estate deals.  And the New York F ed purchases agency CMBSs direc tly.  In addition, I would say,  Main Street helps businesses pay their rent, you know.  So we \u2019re, we\u2019re  helping real estate, you know, in a number of other ways \u2014commercial real estate.    Also, CMBS issuance has resumed.  Spreads have tightened on CMBS.  Ther e are a couple of issues.  One is just that commercial properties with CMBS loans often have covenants \u2014uniformly, I think , have covenants that forbid them to take on more debt.  So you have a situation, and you have a situation where , where you\u2014without a l egal change or some kind of an innovation that defies discovery so far, you\u2019re \u2014you  have a hard time providing mass relief with regard to real estate that\u2019 s in, in commercial mortgage- backed securities.  So we \u2019re still working on it.   We \u2019re still looking.   I would say, it may be that further support for commercial real estate will require further action for Congress \u2014from Congress.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chairman Powell.   So it seems like a lot of the new inflation framework is about shaping inflation expectations.   But the average American who might be watching this m ight be confused as to why the F ed is overshooting inflation.  So what \u2019s your explanation to Main Stre et, to average people what the F ed is trying to do here  and what the outcome would be for those on Main Street ?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: That \u2019s a very , very  important question, and I actually spoke about that in my Jackson Hole remarks a couple weeks ago.  It\u2019 s not intuitive to people.   It is intuitive that, that  high inflation is a bad thing.   It\u2019s less intuitive that inflation can be too low.  And the way I would explain it is , is that inflation that\u2019 s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.  There \u2019s an expectation of future i nflation that\u2019 s built into every interest rate, right?  And to the extent inflation gets lower and lower and lower, interest rates get  lower and lower.  And then the Fed will have less room to cut rates to support the economy.  And this isn \u2019t some idle, you know, academic theory.  This is what \u2019s happening all over the world.  If you, if you look at many, many large jurisdictions around the world, you are seeing that phenomenon.   So we want inflation to be \u2014we want it to be 2  percent , and we want it to average  2 percent .  So if inflation averages 2  percent , the public will expect that , and that \u2019ll be what \u2019s built into interest rates.   And that \u2019s just\u2014that\u2019s all we want.  So we \u2019re not looking to have high inflation.  We just want inflation to average 2  percent .  And that means that , you know, in a downturn, these days , what happens is , inflation, as has happened now \u2014it moves down well below 2 percent .  And that means that we \u2019ve said for , for\u2014we would like to see and we will conduct policies so that inflation moves , for some time , moderately above 2  percent .  So it won\u2019t be\u2014these won \u2019t be large overshoots , and they won\u2019 t be permanent  but to help anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent .  So, yes, it \u2019s, it\u2019s a challenging concept for a lot of people .  But, nonetheless, the economic importance of it is, is  large.  And , you know, those are the people we\u2019re  serving , and, you know, we serve them best if we can actually achieve average 2  percent  inflation , we believe.

Today, important changes were made to the policy statement, reflecting a strong commitment over a longer time horizon guided by their new strategy.Activity in the housing sector has returned to pre-pandemic levels and there are signs of improvement in business investment, but overall activity remains below pre-pandemic levels and the future is highly uncertain. While half of the jobs lost in March and April have been regained, the unemployment rate remains elevated at 8.4%, and the economic downturn has disproportionately affected lower-wage workers, women, and minority groups, creating uncertainty about the future.The pandemic has impacted inflation, with higher prices for some goods due to supply constraints, while weaker demand in sectors affected by the pandemic has kept consumer prices low. The FOMC projects inflation to gradually rise but emphasizes the uncertainty of the economic outlook, which depends on controlling the virus. Public adherence to health guidelines is crucial for a full economic recovery.The Federal Reserve is committed to using all available tools to support the economy and achieve their dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. They will maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these goals are achieved, including keeping interest rates near zero until labor market conditions improve and inflation reaches and exceeds 2 percent.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plans to continue increasing their holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at the current pace to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. They are prepared to adjust monetary policy if necessary and have been taking extensive actions to support credit flow with the help of Congress and the Treasury, but these are lending powers, not spending powers.The FOMC acknowledges the importance of creating programs with broad eligibility to support solvent entities, but recognizes that for some borrowers, taking on difficult-to-repay loans may not be the solution, and instead, direct fiscal support may be necessary. While fiscal policy actions have made a critical difference, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes, and it may require continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to restore economic activity and employment levels.The FOMC is committed to using all available tools to support the economy and ensure a strong recovery. They also pay tribute to Thomas Laubach, a valued colleague whose analysis and advice have greatly influenced policy decisions.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Does the guidance today apply to the current asset purchase pace? Are there any macroeconomic conditions under which you would favor increasing the monthly pace of Treasury and MBS purchases? And under what conditions would a decrease in the monthly pace of purchases be appropriate?\n'ANSWER': The current guidance reflects our intention to continue increasing our securities holdings at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions. We believe these purchases have been effective in restoring orderly market conditions and supporting credit flow. We are prepared to adjust our plans as necessary based on developments.", "QUESTION: Why give guidance on one policy tool but not the other when the Fed has talked about those two policy tools working together?\n\nANSWER: The Fed believes its current policy stance is appropriate and is prepared to adjust it as needed. The strong forward guidance announced today will provide strong support for the economy, stating that rates will remain accommodative until the economy is well into its recovery. Additionally, the Fed is buying securities and has the flexibility to adjust both the rate tool and other tools if necessary.", "QUESTION: How does the Federal Reserve consider financial stability concerns when making decisions on the federal funds rate?\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve considers financial stability concerns as part of its longer-run goals, medium-term outlook, and assessment of risks. However, monetary policy is not the first line of defense for financial stability. The Fed relies on regulation, supervision, capital requirements, liquidity, stress testing, and other macroprudential tools as the frontline defense. Monetary policy is adjusted if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Fed's goals.", "'QUESTION': Would financial stability concerns alone be enough to justify a rate hike if other tools are not available?\n'ANSWER': The test for a rate hike would be if a majority of the Committee believes that monetary policy is causing risks to the financial system that could hinder the Committee's goals. While financial stability concerns are regularly monitored and other tools are used to address them, a rate hike based solely on these concerns has not been done before.", "'QUESTION': How do the projections of the Committee align with its goals, considering that inflation is projected to be below 2 percent for the next four years?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman states that while the projections do not show inflation reaching 2 percent in the next four years, they do get very close to it. The guidance from the Committee indicates their confidence and determination to reach the inflation goal, as long as labor market conditions align with maximum employment and inflation is on track to be moderately above 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': Why wouldn't one of the years show inflation above 2 percent on the median forecast if the Committee is confident it can reach its new goal?\n\n'ANSWER': The Committee expects it will take time to reach the goal due to factors such as the pace of economic recovery, lingering economic struggles, and downward pressure on inflation. However, they believe that as the economy approaches maximum employment, inflation will gradually increase, as seen in previous expansions. The Committee's guidance aims to provide strong support for the economy and expedite the recovery process.", "'QUESTION': Do you anticipate a slowing in the pace of the recovery if there is no additional stimulus package, and are there specific areas in the economy that could benefit from more aid from Congress?\n\n'ANSWER': The recovery is expected to continue at a reasonable pace through 2021, but it will naturally slow down after the initial sharp decline. More fiscal support is likely needed as there are still 11 million people unemployed, struggling small businesses, and state/local governments facing revenue drops and increased spending. Private forecasters also assume substantial additional fiscal support for an ongoing recovery.", "'QUESTION': Should we expect any further evolutions in forward guidance, such as adopting something like the Evans rule?\n'ANSWER': The forward guidance adopted by the Fed is considered appropriate and powerful. It states that policy rates will remain unchanged until labor market conditions align with maximum employment, inflation reaches 2 percent, and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent. This strong and durable guidance is expected to provide significant support to the economy in the future.", "'QUESTION': How do we define assessments of maximum employment, the duration of inflation at 2 percent, and the meaning of \"moderately exceed\" and \"for some time\"?\n\n'ANSWER': Maximum employment is determined by a broad range of factors, including low unemployment, high labor force participation, and wages. Inflation should not be a temporary spike but a return to and maintenance of 2 percent. \"Moderately exceed\" means not significantly above 2 percent, and \"for some time\" means not permanently or for a sustained period. The goal is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time to maintain the central bank's ability to support the economy.", "'QUESTION': Do you consider today's enhanced forward guidance to have actual accommodation to the U.S. economy and deliver further support, or is it just a tweak to your existing policy stance? And do you assume additional fiscal support will be forthcoming in your projections?\n'ANSWER': The enhanced forward guidance aligns with expectations and will provide powerful support for the economy over time. There is an expectation among private forecasters and FOMC participants for further fiscal action, and there seems to be an appetite for it. The lack of additional support could lead to downside risks, such as increased evictions and foreclosures, which would damage the economy.", "'QUESTION': Is the Fed open to considering measures of the economy such as income inequality and housing affordability?\n'ANSWER': The Fed monitors various aspects of the economy, including income inequality and disparities in financial well-being. However, the Fed's tools, such as interest rates, cannot directly address these issues. Distributional issues are important and should be addressed by elected officials, as they impact the economy's productive capacity and the overall prosperity of the workforce.", "'QUESTION': At what point do you think it's prudent to shift the bond purchases from market stability to more stimulus-related longer-term maturities?\n'ANSWER': We believe our asset purchases are currently achieving both market stability and stimulus. Market function has improved significantly since the acute phase of the pandemic, and our asset purchases are providing accommodative financial conditions. We are open to adjusting the size and target sectors of our purchases as needed.", "'QUESTION': What does it mean for the economy if a vaccine is not available until next year?\n'ANSWER': The economy is learning to live with COVID-19 and engage in economic activity despite the ongoing risk. Economic recovery depends on preserving social distancing measures, wearing masks, and regular testing. Certain sectors will struggle until a widely used and trusted vaccine is available. The stress test details for big banks will be announced soon, but no information is available at this time.", "QUESTION: Why is there disagreement between the Federal Reserve, Congress, and the Treasury regarding the loss tolerance for the Main Street Lending Program, hindering credit access for companies in need?\n\nANSWER: The Main Street Lending Program is reaching the whole nation and has over half of the banking industry assets signed up. While the program is relatively small now, it can scale up as needed. Surveys show that firms are not citing credit constraints as a top problem, as there is already a lot of credit available through PPP, bank credit lines, and syndicated loans. However, the Federal Reserve is working on addressing concerns about underwriting expectations and making changes to improve the program's availability.", "'QUESTION': Can you address the reports that the Treasury is advising banks to target zero losses?\n'ANSWER': I don't know about those reports. We will have to go through the banking system to provide loans. Banks are trained to make good loans and we expect them to do some underwriting and take some risk. It's not an easy thing to balance, but we hope credit will continue to flow.", "'QUESTION': How is the Federal Reserve thinking about the overall impact of sectors like airlines and hotels that rely on close contact, and will the Fed keep rates at zero until those sectors recover?\n'ANSWER': The likely path is that the expansion will continue, but sectors that rely on close contact will face challenges for some time. It is uncertain how long this will be, but millions of people are affected. The Fed's commitment is to support the full recovery, including those people, and keep policy accommodative until the goals are achieved.", "'QUESTION': Is the only additional stimulus that can come to the economy from the fiscal side?\n'ANSWER': No, the Federal Reserve still has plenty of tools to provide additional stimulus. They have lending tools, a balance sheet, and further forward guidance. While their rate policy stance is appropriate, they can still use other measures to support the economy. So, they are not out of ammunition.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that your actions are more likely to produce asset price inflation than goods and services inflation, risking a bubble on Wall Street?\n'ANSWER': We monitor financial conditions carefully and have a division focused on financial stability. While there is not a tight connection between asset purchases and financial stability, we will continue to monitor and use tools to strengthen the financial system if needed.", "'QUESTION': How do you reconcile the discrepancy between the number of people claiming unemployment benefits and the number of unemployed individuals reported by the BLS jobs report?\n'ANSWER': The labor market has been recovering but is still far from maximum employment. The counting of claims is volatile and the introduction of new systems like PUA claims makes it difficult to determine the actual level. While initial claims have declined, they are still significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate may be higher if misidentified individuals and those who left the labor force are considered. Overall, there has been substantial improvement, but the level of unemployment remains high.", "'QUESTION': Is the Fed's aim to get back to 3.5 percent or even lower unemployment rate?\n'ANSWER': Yes, the Fed would like to return to a strong labor market with rising wages, ample job opportunities, and sustained labor force participation. While there is no specific target, a 3.5 percent unemployment rate was favorable as it indicated broad-based gains, particularly for those at the lower end of the income spectrum, and increased labor force participation. The Fed believes it can achieve low unemployment without causing problematic inflation.", "'QUESTION': Are there things that the Federal Reserve can do to address racial economic gaps through research and expanding their understanding of wealth disparities?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve conducts significant research on racial disparities, including wealth gaps. They have a team of researchers and divisions focused on consumer and community affairs. They actively engage with communities across the country to understand their experiences and use their tools to reflect the needs of all Americans. They contribute to assessments of the economy and strive for maximum employment, considering various labor market conditions.", "'QUESTION': Can you comment on the two dissenting voters and how you responded to their arguments against the new forward guidance?\n'ANSWER': I won't comment on the dissenters specifically, but they had different perspectives. I value the diverse views of the Committee and the robust discussion we had. The whole Committee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. There will always be a wide range of views, which is healthy. We understand the importance of earning credibility and believe today's guidance is a strong first step.", "'QUESTION': Is there any potential way that the Fed could support commercial real estate borrowers?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has spent a significant amount of time discussing this issue. While their facilities are broad-based and not specifically targeting any single sector, commercial real estate already benefits from existing facilities such as TALF and Main Street. However, providing mass relief for commercial real estate in commercial mortgage-backed securities may require further action from Congress.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed trying to do with inflation and what would be the outcome for average people on Main Street?\n'ANSWER': The Fed wants inflation to average 2 percent because low inflation means lower interest rates, which limits the Fed's ability to support the economy. They are not seeking high inflation, just a consistent 2 percent. This concept may be challenging for some, but it is economically important for the well-being of the public.", "'QUESTION': Why is it important for inflation to be at 2 percent?\n'ANSWER': Inflation that is too low means lower interest rates, which limits the Fed's ability to support the economy. Many large jurisdictions around the world are experiencing this phenomenon. The goal is for inflation to average 2 percent to anchor inflation expectations and provide economic stability."]}
