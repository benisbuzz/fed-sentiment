James Politi with the F inancial Times .  Chair Powell, the Fed  today decided to extend dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of central banks around the world.  Why was that important for the Fed ?  And how concerned are you about dollar shortages persisting over  time through the pandemic?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, s o our \u2014our  dollar swap lines \u2014we introduced those back at the beginning of \u2014of this episode after the pandemic made itself present.  And dollar funding markets were in very difficult shape at the time.  And  the introduction of the swap lines has   really restored dollar funding markets around the world to fairly normal levels of activity.  And so they kind of served their purpose.  But we extended them \u2014I guess , yesterday morning \u2014really to facilitate planning b y other central banks and just so people will know that those facilities are still there.  We want them to remain in place and be available as long as they are needed.  And since, you know, the crisis and the economic fallout from \u2014from  the pandemic are far from over, we \u2019re going to leave those in place for the time being.  And we \u2019ll leave them in place until we \u2019re confident that they \u2019re no longer needed.  There \u2019s nothing that \u2019s going on in the market right now that raises any concerns.  It\u2019 s just , we want th em to be there as a backstop for markets.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Liesman, CNBC.   I hope  that you can hear me.  Mr. Chairman, given\u2014you\u2019 ve said several times now that you have lending , not spending,  powers.  Given that a lot of the capacity of these programs has not been used and, really , barely used, do you think that some of this money that has been dedicated by the Treasury to the Federal Reserve should be considered to be used by Congress as direct grants to businesses that are in need right now or to households, given that Congress is  now saying that money is limited and they shouldn\u2019t take \u2014they do not want to pass a very large stimulus bill?  Is this money doing the best for the nation as a backstop for Federal Reserve programs that don \u2019t seem to be being used all that much right now?   Thank you.  A nd I have a follow -up, sir.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So  they\u2014that \u2014that\u2019s really a question for Congress.  They \u2014they  appropriated that money, and\u2014$454 billion for our facilities, and it \u2019s really a question for them.  So you\u2019 re right that our facilities  have not \u2014we haven \u2019t done as much lending as we thought.  But, in very substantial measure, that \u2019s because markets started working again fairly soon after   we announced the facilities, particularly in the corporate credit facilities, also in the muni \u2014in the  muni  space, and also in the short -term funding facilities \u2014the three of those that we set up.  So we didn\u2019 t turn out to need the kind of funding that we thought we would. On the other hand, it \u2019s important that the facilities stay in place , and that \u2019s why w e extended them yesterday.  It\u2019s important that they still stay in place until we \u2019re, you know, very confident that the turmoil from the pandemic and the economic fallout are behind us.  So I\u2014I can\u2019t really speak to what Congress should do with it, but it \u2019s important that the facilities be there and be fully funded in case the needs do arise down the road.  We don \u2019t see them now, but , in case they do arise, they should be there.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Has any consideration \u2014thank you.  Has any consideration been given to asking Congress to allow the Federal Reserve to lend to companies in bankruptcy?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Not th at I\u2019m aware of, no\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.  No doubt you were paying attention when two of your predecessors were up on Capitol Hill just a few days ago answering some questions from \u2014from  lawmakers.  A nd a question they each answered had to do with the continuation of these pandemic unemployment benefits.  And something we \u2019ve heard a lot is that they could be a disincentive to work.  Both of them addressed  that.  I wonder if you would as well.    And then, as a follow -up, I wonder what you\u2019 ve learned about the degree to which this has led to a widening of the wealth gap in this country, the degree to which maybe people are experiencing two different kinds of \u2014of pandemics here.  Some are getting through this based on what they\u2019 ve saved and the jobs that they have.  Others are really struggling to get by .  And I wonder what role \u2014what additional role the Fed  could have in, sort of , bridging that \u2014that  yawning gap\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , on your first question, I wouldn\u2019 t want to be giving very detailed, specific advice on particular programs and the level they should be at and that kind of thing.  I just will say the following, that, you know, this \u2014this  pandemic and its  fallout really represents the biggest shock to the U .S. economy in living memory.  We went from the lowest levels of unemployment we \u2019d had in 50 years to the highest levels we \u2019ve had in 90 years , and we did it in the space of two months .  And I would say that the response from the fiscal authorities was strong, it was fast, it was broad\u2014and appropriately so.  And I think we are seeing the results of the earlier strong fiscal actions . When you see the spending that \u2019s happening, when you see small businesses  staying in business even though the economy hasn\u2019 t fully , successfully , sustainably reopened yet in many places, you are seeing what happens with that \u2014that  money.  And so, in \u2014in a broad sense, it \u2019s been well  spent .  It\u2019s kept people in their homes .  It\u2019s kept businesses in business.  A nd that \u2019s all a good thing .  I think , in the broad scheme of things, that there will be a need both for more support from us and from more fiscal policy.  Fiscal policy is up to Congress .  You see the ongoing discussions that  they \u2019re having.  And it suggests to me that there \u2019s\u2014you know, that both sides, they\u2019 re wrangling over \u2014over various provisions but nonetheless believe that there is a need for some additional fiscal support .   And the last thing I \u2019ll say is that if the expansion \u2014even if \u2014sorry .  Even if the reopening goes well and many, many people go back to work, it \u2019s still going to take a fairly long time for the parts of the economy that are \u2014that involve lots of people getting together in close proximity.  And that me ans that many of the people who were laid off from those industries \u2014and that \u2019s restaurants, you know, bars, hotels, public entertainment, all of those places, travel and accommodation\u2014m any of those people are going to find it hard to go back\u2014t hey can\u2019 t go back to their old job.  There won\u2019 t be enough jobs for them .  So I think those people are going to need support .  I can \u2019t say what the exact level should be .  It\u2019s not our role .  But they \u2019re going to need support if they\u2019 re to be able to pay their bills, to continue spending money, to remain in their current rental house or\u2014 or apartment or a house if they own it .  So I think there will be a need.  In terms of inequality , really \u2014so I think it \u2019s fair to say that the burdens of the pandemic have fallen  on, heav ily\u2014they\u2019 ve fallen on everyone, but they\u2019 ve fallen very heavily on people who work in the service industries in relatively low -paying jobs .  So there was a\u2014a  figure that came out of some of our research that was that if you make $40,000 a year or less, the n 40 percent \u2014you had a 40 percent  chance of losing your job in April and May.  So it \u2019s falling very heavily on\u2014on people who have the least financial wherewithal to, you know, to bear that .  And that happens to be heavily skewed to minorities and to women.  So that \u2019s just what the pandemic is doing. You know, in terms of what we \u2019re doing, what we \u2019re trying to do is create an environment in the financial markets and in the economy where those people have the best chance they can have to go back to work to t heir old job or to a new job.  That \u2019s really what we\u2019re doing.  Everything we do is directed at that .   And, you know, the \u2014I would say\u2014I would say one last thing on inequality.  That is , inequality is a\u2014is an issue \u2014has been a growing issue in our country and in our economy for four decades .  And you see it \u2014it has many faces.  You see it in the relative flattening -out of \u2014of incomes for people in low and\u2014lower and middle  income s as compared to those at the top.  You see it in low mobility where people \u2014where the  chances of moving up from the bottom to the middle or the top have declined and are lower than they are in other comparable wealthy countries .  So it \u2019s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s  got underlying causes that are not rela ted to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic . Again, four decades of evidence suggests it \u2019s about globalization.  I t\u2019s about the flattening -out of educational attainment in the United States compared to our other competitor countries .  It\u2019s about technology advancing, too.  If you \u2019re on the wrong side of those forces, it \u2019s been \u2014your income has stagnated.  So it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a critical, critical problem for our society , but one that really falls mainly to fiscal policy and other policies .  Our part  of it is to \u2014is to  push as hard as we can on our employment mandate while keeping price stability.  We saw what happened to people at \u2014at the lower end of the income spectrum late in the last expansion.  It was the best labor market in 50  years, they told u s.  We saw that the biggest wage increases were going to people at  the bottom end of the \u2014of the  wage spectrum for the last couple of years of that 10 -year, 8- month expansion.  So a tight labor market is probably the best thing that the Fed  can foster to \u2014to go after that \u2014that problem , which is a \u2014a serious one.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Yeah .  [Inaudible] Journal.  Chair Powell, you have described your asset purchase objective as stabilizing markets.  And with markets having stabilized, aren \u2019t the asset purchases now doing more than address market function by supporting your   macroeconomic objectives?  The other question I have is, what is your strategy going to be with respect to using asset purchases to support your macroeconomic objectives going forward?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So you\u2019 re right, the asset purchases in \u2014in their current size really sprang from severe dysfunction in the Treasury and MBS markets at the beginning of the market reaction to the pandemic .  And thanks to those purchases, we have substantially restored\u2014not fully , but substantially restored functioning markets .  This is absolutely critical.  That market is really one of the \u2014it\u2019s part of the absolute bedrock of the global financial mar kets, and it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s essential that it \u2014that it work well, and it is doing so now . And we \u2019ve always said , though, that we understand, accept , and are fine with the fact that\u2014that those purchases are also fostering a more accommodative stance of monetary poli cy, which would tend to support macroeconomic outcomes .  So it \u2019s doing both, and\u2014 and, you know, we \u2019ve understood that for some time .  It\u2019s not \u2014the programs are not structured exactly like the \u2014the  QE programs were in the last \u2014in the last  financial \u2014in the aftermath of the last financial crisis.  Those were more focused on buying longer -run securities.  The current purchases are all across the\u2014the  maturity spectrum .  Nonetheless, they are supporting accommodative financial conditions .  I think it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s  clear that that\u2019 s the case.  In terms of our strategy, you know, that just remains to be seen.  We\u2014as you know, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time in meetings this year looking at the tools that we have to adjust our current stance of policy .  We do feel that our curren t monetary policy stance is the appropriate one.  You know, we cut rates close t o zero right at the beginning.  W e\u2014we ramped up asset purchases, and those \u2014those  have really helped.  And we gave forward guidance on\u2014 on both of those things , which the markets  appear to understand, and market pricing is consistent with   those .  So we think we\u2019re \u2014we think  that our \u2014our  policy stance is a good one .  We\u2019re, of course , prepared to adjust that stance as appropriate and when we deem it as appropriate to \u2014to better foste r achievement of our goals , of course \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  T hank you for taking my question.  You talked to Larry Fink at BlackRock in March, April , and May , according to your public calendars.  I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what you talked about , and, if the topic of those conversations was the corporate credit facilities, how did you handle potential conflicts of interest during those conversations?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, so \u2014so BlackRock is just our agent .  You know, we make the policy decisions in conjunction with our colleagues , and they just execute our \u2014our  plans .  I actually don \u2019t remember exactly what I would have been talking with him about , but he\u2019s a\u2014you know, he \u2019s the h ead of a major service provider .  He generally checks in to find out whether we\u2019re okay with the quality of the service that \u2014that BlackRock is providing.  I don\u2019 t have the daily face -to-face interaction with anybody else at BlackRock or \u2014or, as you can see,  three phone calls in the course of a few months .  It wasn \u2019t very many. So I think, you know, their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual arrangements we have with them .  And, again, I would have \u2014I\u2014I can \u2019t recall exactly what those c onversations were, but they were \u2014they would have been about what are you seeing in the markets and things like that too\u2014you know, generally exchanging information.  And he \u2019s\u2014he\u2019s  typically trying to make sure that\u2014that  we are getting good service from the company that he founded and leads .  That\u2019s \u2014I\u2019d say that \u2019s his main objective when we talk.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  Scott Horsl ey from NPR .  I wonder if you can give us an update on the coin shortage that you talked to lawmakers about last month and what, if anything, that tells  us about the , sort of , economic circulatory system \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Yes.  So\u2014the situation with coins is that the\u2014the  quantity of coins is going up but was adequate before the pandemic .  The problem is , the circulation kind of stopped because stores were closed, banks were closed .  It just\u2014customers weren \u2019t spending, they were \u2014so the coins stopped moving in the system .  So we \u2019ve been working for \u2014ever since that began to happen, we saw it happening right away.  We\u2019ve been working to try to \u2014try to  reverse that disruption of the supply chain and restore normal circulation for our coins .  So we \u2019re working with the  U.S. Mint , which is the issuing authority , to address the issue.  Just last week, the M int\u2014you may have seen \u2014issued a statement asking for the public \u2019s help  in keeping coins circulating, a nd various people, you know, went and put their coins back into circulation. We also created a coin task force with all of the stakeholders \u2014you know, banks and, you know, the armored carriers, the banking community, credit unions , everybody in the \u2014in the  coin supply chain .  We\u2019re in frequent communication with the banks and with the \u2014with the  armored carriers tryin g to get back to where we need to be .  So we do think the inventories are building up.  You know, the M int\u2014the Mint  is making coins as fast as they can, but \u2014but , you know, things happen with \u2014in the factory environment :  Someone will come to work with COVID \u2014I think this has happened in \u2014in almost every factory environment around the country \u2014and then they\u2019 ll shut down for a day, and then they come back, and that kind of thing.  So \u2014so  we\u2019re closely monitoring it .  It\u2019s \u2014you know, it \u2019s a significant issue.  We\u2019ve\u2014we\u2019ve  got a lot of resources on it , and we do feel like we\u2019 re\u2014we\u2019re  making progress.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hey, Chair Powell .  Thank you for taking my question.  I \u2019m wondering if you can be a bit more specific about any risks that you see related to a double -dip recession or signs that the recovery was stalling, or maybe begin to stall ing, compared to some of the signs that we were seeing earlier in the summer .  Thanks very much.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Yeah .  So maybe I \u2019ll talk more broadly about the \u2014the  outlook and include your \u2014include your  question in it .  So, as I mentioned, economic activity and employment picked up beginning in May and right through June and remained well  below their levels because, I \u2019d say , job gains have reversed about a third of the job losses from March and April, a nd consumer spending has reversed about a half of the drop.  So \u2014but , nonetheless, those were \u2014those were  sooner and stronger than we expecte d.  So \u2014but what happened then was , along with that positive data, we got \u2014we got  the virus increases starting in the middle of June in lots and lots of states around the country.  And that brings us to a new \u2014a new  point here , which is, we need to \u2014in addition to dealing with the health crisis \u2014we have to remember , this is really a health crisis, and these are people who are having the coronavirus , and it\u2019s taking a terrible toll, so we \u2019ve got to deal with the economic ramifications of that . So what we \u2019re seeing is that we monitor quite a lot of what we \u2014what we  think of as sort of nonstandard, high- frequency data .  That \u2019s become a very important thing, even more important than usual in the work that we do.  And what that data show , on balance , is that the pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since the cases began that spike in June.  So some measures of consumer spending based on credit card and debit card data have moved down.  Recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, partic ularly among smaller businesses.  Hotel occupancy rates have flattened out .  People aren \u2019t going out to restaurants, bars, gas stations, pharmacies , and beauty salons as much.  Consumer surveys, by the way,   which had dropped very sharply when the pandemic arrived and then moved back up sharply\u2014they look like they may be softening again now . There are still some areas of strength .  Housing and motor vehicle sales have still been strong.  Nonetheless, on balance, it looks like the data are pointing to a slowi ng in the pace of the recovery.  But I want to stress, it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s too early to say both how large that is and how sustained it will be .  We just don \u2019t know yet, because we have to wait for \u2014to see the, you know, the actual data on spending and employment com e in, and \u2014but this \u2014this is what we \u2019re seeing, and , of course , we\u2019re monitoring it very carefully . And I \u2019d be remiss in not stressing this enough.  The path of the economy is going to depend to a very high extent on the course of the virus  and on the measures that we take to keep it in check .  That is just a very fundamental fact about our economy right now .  The two things are not in conflict.  You know, social -distancing measures and fast reopening of the economy, they actually go together .  They \u2019re not in competition with each other.  So \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Well, just to follow up on that a bit \u2014and thanks for taking my question\u2014you added the sentence into the statement about the course of the economy depends on the path of the virus .  Is this \u2014do you feel this idea , or this view , is not widely enough understood?  Do you feel \u2014you had warned back in May that too early reopening or an incautious reopening might harm the economy.  Do you feel that message was not heard , and that some of these reopenings took place  perhaps  sooner than they should have?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, I think we feel that it \u2014it might be , the most central fact or the most central driver of the path of the economy right now is the virus .  And you\u2019 re seeing that again now .  You saw that in the \u2014during the lockdown when we got cases way down, a nd   you saw the economy reopening, and you saw spending go up and hiring go up.  And now that the\u2014that the  cases have spiked again \u2014again , the early data, the high -frequency data suggest that there is a slower pace of growth, at least for now .  We don \u2019t know how deep or how long that will be .  So it\u2019s such an important sentence .  We just decided that it needed to be in our \u2014in our postmeeting st atement .  It\u2019s so fundamental .  And, you know, I think we can\u2019 t say it enough.  It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s really important. We\u2019re \u2014you know, you can think of it as three  stages.  There \u2019s the lockdown, and we know what that looks like, and we \u2019ll get the data , I guess , later this week on GDP being down very historically large amounts .  Then there was the reopening, a nd we would expect that many, many people would go back to work.  Those w hose jobs could be done without \u2014you know, without exposure to lots of people in tight groups , they should have been \u2014they should be able to go back to work during that phase fairly quickly .  But that would depend on being able to keep the virus under control, which will depend on wearing masks and other social -distancing measures.  So that \u2019s where we are.  It\u2019s such an important factor .  It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s in\u2014we \u2019re all talking about it , so we thought it really had to be in the statement\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, I \u2019m wondering what it is \u2014you \u2019ve talked a lot about using all of your tools , and Governor Brainard talked about moving from support to accommodation\u2014w hat it is you can actually do.  Y ou\u2019ve lowered rates to zero .  Yo u\u2019ve set up the lending programs .  There hasn \u2019t been much take -up.  And the tools you talk about are generally in service of keeping interest rates low , where they already are.  So unless you were to go to negative interest rates, I \u2019m wondering what additional accommodation the Fed  can bring.    Or is it really up to the fiscal authorities at this point to rescue the economy, to \u2014to add additional help for it?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Right .  So you\u2019 re right.  We are committed to using our full ra nge of tools to support the  U.S. economy at this difficult time , and we will always remain committed in that sense.  We feel like we have ways to further support the economy certainly through our credit and liquidity facilities , which are effectively unlim ited.  We can adjust those programs.  We also can adjust our forward guidance.  We can adjust our asset purchases.  So there are things that we can do .  We\u2014we  feel like we have the ability to do more . But I would not disagree with the \u2014with the  importance o f fiscal policy \u2014with your statement about the importance of fiscal policy .  Fiscal policy can do\u2014can address things that we can \u2019t address.  I f there are particular groups that need help , that need direct monetary help\u2014not a loan, but an actual grant  as the PPP program showed\u2014 you can save a lot of businesses and a lot of jobs with those in a case where lending a company money might not be the right answer .  The company might not want to take a loan out in order to pay workers who can\u2019 t work because there \u2019s no business .  So lending is a particular tool , and we \u2019re using it very aggressively.  But fiscal policy is essential here, and I would say , again, Congress \u2019s action early in the pandemic \u2014historically large by any standard around the world, and certainly by U.S. standards\u2014i t\u2019s really helping now .  It\u2019s really helping .  It\u2019s going to stand up very well  to\u2014to scrutiny down the years .  This  Congress \u2019s very fa st and very open- handed response, I think, has really helped .  And I think\u2014I know that, as I \u2019ve said, ver y likely more will be needed from \u2014from  all of us, a nd I see Congress negotiating now over \u2014over  a new package , and I think that \u2019s a good thing\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  So you talked about it several times today :  The FOMC statement directly says the path of the economy is linked to the path of the virus .  It looks like a vaccine might come this year, either in October or toward s the end of the year .  Has the C ommittee talked about how that might change Fed  policies?  And , as a follow, do you see a vaccine helping inflation get back to where you want it to be?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So we \u2014of course , the concept of vaccines comes up in our discussions .  Of co urse it does .  But I have to say, you know, we\u2019re \u2014our job is not to plan for the upside case, right?  The upside case\u2014we \u2019ve got that covered.  Our job is to plan for all \u2014the full range of things that could happen.  And so we \u2019re assuming \u2014we \u2019re going to cont inue to assume that our facilities are needed, that our policies are needed , and that the public needs \u2014you know, needs  the support that we \u2019re giving the public until \u2014until shown otherwise .  There \u2019s great uncertainty around the development of therapeutics a nd vaccines .  All of us want them to happen as soon as possible, but we can \u2019t plan on that .  We\u2019ve got to hope for the worst \u2014hope for the  [laughs ]\u2014hope for the  best and plan for the worst, I guess it goes . In terms of inflation, I don \u2019t know .  I mean, I \u2014you know, I think, fundamentally, this is a disinflationary shock.  I know there \u2014there  is a lot of discussion about how this might lead to inflation over time , but, you know, we \u2019re\u2014we\u2019re  seeing disinflationary pressures around the world going into this .  Now  we see a big shock to demand, and we see core inflation dropping to 1 percent .  And I do think for quite some time we \u2019re going to be struggling against disinflationary pressures rather than against inflationary pressures.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Yes, thanks for taking my question.  So , I mean, as you monitor the rising infections and the slowing pace of the recover y, could you speak to , what would the trigger be for doing further easing?   And on the flip side of that, whe n would it be reasonable to expect the Fed to consider raising rates again?  Thanks \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, you know, as we \u2019ve said, we\u2019 re carefully monitoring the situation .  We moved very quickly and very aggressively early, an d we \u2019ve been monitoring the  situation.  And I think the markets and\u2014and the economy\u2014you know, I think our policy is in a good place .  But we \u2019ve looked at \u2014at ways of adapting our policy as time goes by, and we \u2019re ready to do that when we think it \u2019s appropriate .  I can \u2019t give you a specific trigger .  It really just is when we think it would help:   Would it help more than what we \u2019re doing now to foster maximum employment and stable prices? Sorry, your second question was?  [ Inaudible ]  I can \u2019t hear you .  Say it again?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Sorry \u2014for when it would be reasonable for the Fed  to consider raising \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Oh.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: \u2014rates again.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So as I \u2014as I  said earlier , or a while back, we \u2019re not even thinking about \u2014thinking about  raising rates.  We\u2019re\u2014we\u2019 re totally focused on providing the economy the support that it will need .  We think that the economy will need highly accommodative monetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period.  And we \u2019re absolutely committed to staying in this until \u2014until we \u2019re very confident that that is no longer needed.  So I wouldn\u2019 t look for us to be sending signals about cutting back on facilities or anything like that for a very long time .  We\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re  in this until \u2014until  we\u2019re well through it.    And I think this \u2014you know, I think the picture is , you have the \u2014you have the  lockdown, then you have the reopening.  But there \u2019s probably going to be a long tail where a large number of people are struggling to get back to work because those \u2014those  heavily affected areas of  the economy are going to be challenged , really , to employ the millions of people who are now out of work .  I think 14 million people are now out of work who were working in February, something like that.  So that \u2019s going to take a while , I think , in everyone \u2019s reckoning.  And I just \u2014everyone should know that we \u2019re going to be there for all of that.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair .  Thanks for taking our questions .  You mentioned earlier that the labor mark et we had in February was the best we\u2019 ve had in 50 years, yet at that point the B lack unemployment rate was still double that of whites .  So I wanted to ask you, you know, we \u2019ve seen some economists and even  the Biden campaign call for the Fed  to more specifically target the gap between minority unemployment rates .  Even if you don\u2019 t get a mandate on this from Congress, is it something you would consider more explicitly going forward?  And how would you do that?  And then I also wanted to ask you about former economist Claudia Sahm \u2019s writings from last night.  She gave a pretty harrowing account of her time at the Fed \u2014described harassment and professional gaslighting that others have also spoken to.  Is this your F ederal R eserve?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Okay .  So, first,  on the unemployment, you\u2019 re right .  And we always point this out in our \u2014in our  remarks.  While the aggr egate unemployment rate was 3 \u00bd percent , every \u2014every  economy \u2014every market in every economy has longer -run issues .  And one of ours is just the disparate level of unemployment between \u2014between  Blacks and whites.  And it \u2019s generally sort of twice as much \u2014twice as high for B lacks.  So even\u2014but this was the lowest,   you know, B lack unemployment rate in 50 years \u2014or, actually , sinc e we started keeping records, which was less than 50 years ago .  So that \u2019s just a fact , and it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s  not a good fact, you know. So we have started , though, in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on disparate levels of unemployment \u2014for example, among\u2014among different racial groups and demographic groups .  We regularly discuss those differences in our FOMC discussions.  We call them out in testim ony and in speeches and in our Monetary Policy Report  to Congress .  You \u2019ll see it everywhere, i n all the things that we do. So what does that mean?  I think \u2014you know, I think what we learned is that a tight labor market really does a lot of good things for minorities and people at the lower end of the income spectrum generally .  But  it\u2014you know, tight labor markets, it took 8 years \u2014it took sort of the 8th and 9th and 10th years of that expansion to get to those benefits .  So we need more than that .  That\u2019s not a good strategy, waiting 8, 9, 10 years to get there.  So we \u2019re\u2014we\u2019re  going to get back there as fast as we can , because that \u2019s what we can do , but society more broadly can affect these things .  You know, we don\u2019 t really have tools that can address distributional, disparate outcomes as well as fiscal policy .  And just policy general ly\u2014education, health care, all those things are much better at doing that.  In terms of\u2014so we do\u2014you will see that \u2014you will see that discussed \u2014the B lack unemployment rate discussed all the time in what we do.  And I think we clearly understand now that it\u2019 s something to weigh when you get a tight labor market .  It\u2019s something that you want to be focused on and weigh.  So it is very much in our thinking \u2014again, in a world where we don\u2019 t really have the best tools to address that .  So, something that we \u2019re doing.  So I have not seen that \u2014I did not see that blog post yet, although someone did mention it to me .  We, of course , have been in meetings until just before this .  So, but \u2014and I will take a   look at it .  I will do that.  And, you know, I \u2014without having had a  chance to think about it, read it, understand it, I \u2019ll just say a couple things .  First, I think it\u2019 s fair to acknowledge that there \u2019s been a lot of pain and injustice and unfair treatment that women have experienced in the workplace \u2014not just among econom ists, but among economists and at the Fed .  That \u2019s been going on for far too long .  And , you know, like every other organization, the Fed  could have done more and\u2014and should have done more . I would say,  though, that we \u2014you know, we have made it a very high priority to have as diverse and inclusive an organization as we can .  And I think we \u2019ve made a lot of progress on that.  I think we want a place where it \u2019s free to speak, where views are welcome, where people can disagree but must do so respectfully.  I think a lot of organizations are coming around to understanding the importance of that .  And I \u2014my experience has been, you know, from my career in business too, is that organizations \u2014the really successful organizations in our society get this .  They do.  Th ey\u2014mostly , they get it that if you want to attract the best people, this is what you\u2014you\u2019 re going to attract the best people by having a diverse and inclusive workforce , so\u2014and workplace .  So we \u2019ve made diversity a priority . We actually \u2014you know, this has been a big issue for the economics profession .  We had the\u2014the  two heads of the AEA task force on this \u2014who happen to be named Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen \u2014come here, and I cohosted  a\u2014an event with them , I guess , last year or the year before , which had several hundred\u2014 500 people or something like that listening in about \u2014about  these issues.  So we \u2019re doing a lot .  I\u2019m sure we can do  more .  We\u2019re doing a lot to\u2014 you know, to foster a respectful climate\u2014particularly for women , but for \u2014for  all people .  So it \u2019s\u2014it\u2019s  a very high priority for us as an organization.  I will look into \u2014into that and \u2014when I \u2014you know, when this is over.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Chair Powell, on the labor market, jobless claims rose again recently, and new hi ring activity has weakened .  I wonder, how big are the risks of the unemployment rate rising and job growth turning negative this summer?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So as I mentioned earlier, you know, we \u2019re watching this high -frequency data .  And , of course , the offi cial labor market reports come out once a month , and no one has had a very good record lately of predicting what they\u2019 re going to say.  They \u2019ve been, in May and June , stronger than anybody expected, particularly in May.  So I would say,  some humility is ap propriate here in terms of thinking we understand exactly where this is going.  I think all we can say today is that there \u2019s\u2014there\u2019s  evidence in the high -frequency data, the surveys , and , you know, you\u2019 re tracking \u2014you get pictures of spending.  You get pic tures of people \u2019s movements .  And what we \u2014it looks like we \u2019re seeing a slowdown in the rate of growth.  That\u2019s \u2014and that might be \u2014it might be  short  lived, it might not be, you know .  And it seems to be related to \u2014and the timing of it seems to be related to the spike in cases that began in the middle of June . Now, I really don\u2019 t want to get ahead of where the data are on this.  So we \u2019re just going to have to see .  We\u2019re going to have to\u2014the data over the next couple of months will answer that question.  And r ecent experience suggests we\u2014 we need to wait and see .  In any case, there \u2019s clearly a risk that we \u2019re going to see a slowdown in the rate of growth in economic activity and in hiring.  It might still be at a robust level.

I wanted to ask about the 13( 3) facilities .  You all have used your emergency authority to buy assets that you can \u2019t directly  buy, like corporate bonds, ETF s.  So I was just wondering, what is the scope of your authority under 13( 3)?  What type of assets are you allowed to buy?  Could you buy equities through an SPV , for example?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, we haven\u2019 t\u2014we haven\u2019t  looked at that , and we have no\u2014no intention .  We haven \u2019t done any work or thought about buying equities .  But , you know, we\u2014we \u2019re bound by the \u2014by the  provisions of 13( 3), which requires that we make, you know, facilities \u2014programs or  facilities of  broad applicability, m eaning we have to have \u2014it can \u2019t just be focused on one entity.  You know, it has to be a broad group of entities . There \u2019s a lot in 13( 3) about \u2014about  the solvency of the borrowers .  You know, remember, it was rewritten or amended after the financial crisis, and it was written in a way that was\u2014that was to \u2014meant to make it challenging to bail out large financial institutions .  That\u2019s \u2014there was a lot in there to make sure that, you know, that they were going to be solvent  and things like that .  So, you know, we have to meet those requirements.

Greg Robb from Market Watch .  Can you hear me?  Okay.  One of the things in this crisis that \u2019s unusual is that companies are cuttin g wages and salaries, and that \u2019s something, you know, we haven\u2019 t seen much .  And I was wondering what the Fed is thinking about this .  It\u2014it  seems to indicate that inflation could be more volatile in coming\u2014coming months and coming years\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, I\u2014 I think that the main thing that tells you is that the \u2014the labor market has a long way to go to recover .  You know, we had a good labor market .  It wasn \u2019t perfect .  There were always issues.  There are always going to be issues within an economy .  Bu t the labor market really has a long way to go now .  Even with two very strong months of job creation \u20147\u00bd million jobs between the two months \u2014we still have 14 million people unemployed .  So it \u2019s just \u2014it\u2019 s a long way to go.  And as\u2014and that leads to a situation where there are so many people looking for jobs, and we have the economy only partially reopened.  So there aren \u2019t, you know \u2014until the economy\u2014or as the economy fully reopens, people can  go back to work, but \u2014so it\u2019s a tough situation.  And I\u2019ve re ad reports of that .  You know, of course , the reported wages went up because of the composition effect \u2014you know, it\u2019s low -paid workers didn\u2019 t go back to work, so\u2014they were the ones that got laid off \u2014so average hourly earnings went up.  But clearly, clearly  the pressure\u2014there will not be much upward pressure on wages and compensation at the aggregate   level here in a world where there are just an awful lot of people looking for work .  And the main \u2014so it just underscores again the \u2014the  urgency of doing everythi ng we can to restore the labor force and\u2014and to support those who are \u2014who want to be in the labor force but whose jobs have gone away for some period of time as they find other work due to this natural disaster \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you very much.  I wanted to ask about forward guidance .  Do you see merits to tying your asset purchases to economic outcomes?  And would you consider both inflation and labor market conditions as part of those outcomes?  A nd specifically , for the labor market , what conditions would you want to see before you think about pulling back stimulus ?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So that \u2019s a great discussion that  we\u2014we \u2019ve talked about that at past meetings, and I imagine we will at fu ture meetings and haven \u2019t made any decisions yet on that .  But, you know, you\u2019 ve got a couple ways to go.  You can tie \u2014you can tie them to dates .  You can say we will \u2014for a specific period of time, we will keep rates at X level.  Or you can say we\u2019ll keep them there until you achieve a certain macroeconomic goal .  And it can either be inflation or it could be an employment goal, as you pointed out . And I think that, you know, there \u2019s attraction in all of those depending on the situation, I think, for obvious reasons.  You can imagine situations where, you know, where you\u2019 d really want to be targeting macroeconomic outcomes .  It\u2019s also the case, though, that sometimes\u2014sometimes date -based guidance works too .  I think it really is very fact  specific, and it \u2019s not something we \u2019ve\u2014you know, we haven\u2019 t made any decisions on that, so I wouldn\u2019 t be standing here telling you we \u2019re going to go this way or that way, you know, should the time come for us to\u2014to change our forward guidance.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell .  Thanks for doing this today.  I wanted to ask, on the stimulus bill that Senate Republicans are considering, they \u2019ve said that they\u2019 re weighing whether to revise the Collins A mendment  in order to ease the tier 1 lever age ratio for banks .  Are you concerned that doing so will deplete bank  capital, given that the Fed \u2019s stress test s showed that, under the most severe scenarios for economic recovery , that several banks would approach the regulatory minimum capital  requirem ents\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So\u2014okay.  So I think what the stress tests  showed is that , under the \u201cregular way\u201d  stress test, the banks passed .  But right in the middle of the \u2014of the  stress test came the pandemic.  And so we quickly dropped in three other scenarios , which were, you know, really bad scenarios.  And many of the banks passed, but some didn\u2019 t.  So we \u2014and that was done very quickly.  S o we pivoted, and we used the provision that says we can \u2014that says there \u2019s been a material change, and we \u2019re going to ask them to resubmit their capital plans .  We also stopped buybacks \u2014share buybacks and limited dividends .  So we \u2019re working through the details of how all of that will work .

So, I would say, that \u2019s\u2014you know, that \u2014that  process is working that way. And\u2014but you\u2019 re making a connection to it, to the Collins A mendment  fix.  So what \u2019s going on there is that, like many other supervisors and regulators around the world, what we found is that our \u2014we have found our banks are strong.  They \u2019re strongly capitalized , with lots of liquidity .  And they\u2019 ve really been a source of strength in this \u2014in this  crisis so far .  And they\u2019 ve written off bad loans and things like that .  The y\u2019re still well capitalized and strong and will be , I think, a source of strength in this situation.    So\u2014but what \u2014what  we did earlier was , we\u2014what happens is , the banks run up against their leverage ratio, which is a non- risk-sensitive measure just of the amount of assets on the balance sheet .  So people put cash in\u2014on deposit at the banks , and they reached the limit of how\u2014how  much they could grow or made loans \u2014you know, they\u2014companies drew down loans and deposited cash .  So we gave some leverage ratio reli ef earlier by temporarily \u2014it\u2019 s temporary relief \u2014by eliminating, temporarily , Treasuries from the  calculation of the \u2014of the  leverage ratio .  This is  a\u2014this is  another additional thing to do .  If Congress chooses to do this, we would want it to be explicitly  temporary .  We \u2014in other words, this will not be a permanent change in capital standards . We haven \u2019t decided to do it, but it would give us the ability to allow banks to grow their balance sheet and , in doing so, to serve their customers better .  And , you know, I have to tell you, if you look around the world, bank regulators \u2014many, many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief .  You know, Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, the European Commission did, the Bank of Canada di d, we did.  It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not \u2014what it \u2019s doing is , it\u2019s allowing them to grow their balance sheet in a way that serves their customers .  That\u2014that \u2019s really what it\u2019 s doing.  And, again, I would want it to be explicitly temporary if \u2014if we do do it.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Okay, thank you.  We\u2019ll go to Brian Ch eung for the last question. BRIAN CH EUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell .  Thanks so much.  Brian Ch eung with Yahoo Finance .  I wanted to ask just how the framework review is working in tandem with your discussion on explicit forward guidance .  So is the idea that you\u2019 re trying to have some order to that, that you would announce the findings of the Fed  review before then committing to some sort of explicit forward guidance or even yield curve control policy?   Thanks . \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, so I do think that completion of the review would\u2014first of all, it \u2019s something that was a very high priority  for\u2014we were really looking forward to completing it , probably, at the June meeting, but it might have been the meeting before that .  We were right on track, and then we got distracted.  I \u2014and we weren \u2019t expecting the pandemic, of course .  Nobody was .  So the pandemic came in .  I think it is important to go back and f inish that, and I do think that will inform, you know, everything we do going forward.  I would also tell you, though, that , to\u2014to a very large extent , the\u2014the  changes we \u2019ll make to the S tatement of [on]  Longer -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy are rea lly codifying the way we \u2019re already acting with our policies .  To a large extent, we\u2019 re already doing the things that are \u2014that are  in there .  This is just a way of \u2014of acknowledging that and putting them in the document .  I can \u2019t tell you what the exact tim ing of that will be, but I do think that \u2019s a\u2014that\u2019s a sensible way to think about it .

While household spending has partially recovered, business fixed investment has not shown signs of improvement.Despite some positive economic news in May and June, overall activity remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels, with the second quarter expected to see the largest contraction in real GDP on record. The labor market has followed a similar pattern, with employment rising in May and June but still far below pre-outbreak levels, particularly impacting lower-wage workers, women, and minority groups. The pandemic has also had a significant impact on inflation, with higher prices for certain goods exacerbating the financial burden for those facing income loss.The weaker demand in sectors most affected by the pandemic has kept consumer prices low, causing inflation to fall below the 2 percent objective. However, the recent increase in economic activity has brought new challenges, as the number of COVID-19 cases has sharply risen, impacting both the economy and the health of the nation.The Federal Reserve is committed to using all available tools to support the economy during this challenging time, including holding the policy rate near zero and purchasing Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to maintain orderly market conditions and promote more accommodative financial conditions. These actions are crucial for preserving the flow of credit, mitigating economic damage, and promoting recovery, especially as families and businesses face the risk of cutting back on necessities, losing homes, downsizing, and experiencing job and income losses.The Federal Reserve's lending programs have been successful in providing financing where it is needed and supporting credit markets, leading to increased lending from private lenders. These programs will continue until the economy is on a solid path to recovery, and once the crisis is over, they will be put back in the toolbox.The current economic downturn is severe and many people may struggle to repay loans, so direct fiscal support may be necessary. The fiscal policy actions taken so far have made a critical difference, but it will take time and continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to restore economic activity and employment levels.The lower interest rates have limited the Committee's ability to stimulate the economy, and the pandemic has caused delays in concluding their review. Despite this, they remain committed to using all available tools to support the economy and ensure a strong recovery.The speaker expresses anticipation for any inquiries that may arise.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Why did the Fed decide to extend dollar liquidity swap lines with central banks and how concerned are they about dollar shortages during the pandemic?\n'ANSWER': The Fed introduced dollar swap lines at the beginning of the pandemic to restore dollar funding markets. The extension is to facilitate planning by other central banks and ensure the facilities remain available as long as needed. The Fed will keep them in place until confident they are no longer necessary, serving as a backstop for markets.", "'QUESTION': Should the money dedicated by the Treasury to the Federal Reserve be used by Congress as direct grants to businesses and households, considering that the Federal Reserve programs have not been used much?\n'ANSWER': The decision on how to use the money is up to Congress. While the Federal Reserve facilities have not seen as much lending as expected, it is important to keep them in place until the economic fallout from the pandemic is resolved. The facilities should be fully funded in case the need arises in the future.", "'QUESTION': Has any consideration been given to asking Congress to allow the Federal Reserve to lend to companies in bankruptcy?\n'ANSWER': Not that I'm aware of, no.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed's perspective on the continuation of pandemic unemployment benefits and its impact on the wealth gap?\n'ANSWER': The Fed acknowledges the significant economic shock caused by the pandemic and praises the strong and broad fiscal response. They believe that more support from both the Fed and fiscal policy is needed. The Fed recognizes the heavy burden on low-paying service industry workers, particularly minorities and women, and aims to create an environment for them to return to work. They also highlight that inequality is a long-standing issue influenced by factors beyond monetary policy.", "QUESTION: Aren't asset purchases now doing more than addressing market function by supporting macroeconomic objectives? What is the strategy for using asset purchases to support macroeconomic objectives going forward?\n\nANSWER: The current asset purchases were initially aimed at stabilizing the Treasury and MBS markets during the pandemic. While they have restored market functioning, they also support accommodative financial conditions and macroeconomic outcomes. The strategy for using asset purchases in the future remains to be seen, but the current monetary policy stance is considered appropriate and can be adjusted if necessary.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide some information about your conversations with Larry Fink at BlackRock and how you handled potential conflicts of interest?\n'ANSWER': BlackRock is our agent and we make policy decisions together. I don't remember the specifics of those conversations, but they were likely about market observations and exchanging information. Fink's main objective is to ensure we receive good service from BlackRock, which is managed carefully through our contractual arrangements.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide an update on the coin shortage and what it tells us about the economic circulatory system?\n'ANSWER': The quantity of coins is increasing, but circulation stopped due to store and bank closures during the pandemic. Efforts are being made to restore normal circulation, including working with the U.S. Mint, creating a coin task force, and communicating with banks and armored carriers. Inventories are building up, but disruptions in the factory environment due to COVID-19 are being closely monitored. Progress is being made.", "'QUESTION': Can you be more specific about the risks of a double-dip recession or signs of a stalling recovery compared to earlier in the summer?\n'ANSWER': Economic activity and employment improved from May to June, but job gains and consumer spending have not fully recovered. The increase in COVID-19 cases since June has slowed the pace of the recovery, with indicators showing a decline in consumer spending, job growth, and certain sectors. It's too early to determine the extent and duration of the slowdown, as it depends on the virus and measures taken to control it. Social distancing and reopening the economy are not conflicting strategies.", "'QUESTION': Do you feel that the idea that the course of the economy depends on the path of the virus is not widely understood? Was the message about the potential harm of early reopenings not heard?\n'ANSWER': The most central driver of the economy right now is the virus. The economy reopened and saw growth when cases were down, but with the recent spike in cases, there is a slower pace of growth. The statement emphasizes the importance of controlling the virus through measures like wearing masks and social distancing.", "'QUESTION': What additional accommodation can the Fed bring to support the economy, or is it up to fiscal authorities to provide additional help?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is committed to using its full range of tools to support the economy, including credit and liquidity facilities, adjusting forward guidance, and asset purchases. However, fiscal policy is also essential and can address things that the Fed cannot, such as providing direct monetary help to specific groups in need. Congress's early and generous response has been helpful, and it is likely that more will be needed from all parties.", "'QUESTION': Has the Committee discussed how a potential vaccine and the path of the virus might change Fed policies, and could a vaccine help with inflation?\n'ANSWER': The Committee acknowledges the concept of vaccines in their discussions, but their job is to plan for all possible scenarios, not just the upside case. They will continue to assume that their facilities and policies are needed until proven otherwise. There is uncertainty around the development of therapeutics and vaccines, and they cannot rely on them. In terms of inflation, they believe this is a disinflationary shock and expect to struggle against disinflationary pressures rather than inflationary pressures.", "'QUESTION': What would be the trigger for further easing and when would the Fed consider raising rates again?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is carefully monitoring the situation and believes its policy is in a good place. They are ready to adapt their policy as needed to foster maximum employment and stable prices, but cannot provide a specific trigger for further easing or a timeline for raising rates.", "'QUESTION': Sorry \u00e2\u0080\u0094for when it would be reasonable for the Fed to consider raising?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell's response was simply \"Oh.\"", "'QUESTION': Are there any plans to raise interest rates?\n'ANSWER': We are not considering raising rates at this time. Our focus is on providing support to the economy and we believe that highly accommodative monetary policy will be necessary for an extended period. We are committed to staying in this until we are confident it is no longer needed. There will be a long recovery period for those heavily affected by the pandemic, and we will continue to provide support throughout.", "'QUESTION': Would the Federal Reserve consider explicitly targeting the gap between minority unemployment rates?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve acknowledges the disparate levels of unemployment between Blacks and whites and has been focusing on addressing these differences in recent years. While a tight labor market benefits minorities, waiting 8-10 years for those benefits is not a good strategy. The Fed recognizes the importance of addressing these disparities but acknowledges that fiscal policy and broader societal factors are better equipped to address distributional outcomes. The Fed is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive organization and acknowledges the need for more progress in creating a respectful climate for all individuals.", "'QUESTION': How big are the risks of the unemployment rate rising and job growth turning negative this summer?\n'ANSWER': We are monitoring high-frequency data and official labor market reports. It is difficult to predict the future accurately, but there is evidence of a slowdown in the rate of growth, possibly related to the spike in COVID-19 cases. We need to wait for more data to determine the extent of the slowdown and the risks to job growth.", "'QUESTION': What is the scope of the Federal Reserve's authority under 13(3) and what type of assets are they allowed to buy?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is bound by the provisions of 13(3), which require them to create facilities or programs of broad applicability. They have not considered buying equities and have focused on buying corporate bonds and municipal bonds through their facilities.", "'QUESTION': Is the primary focus of the statute on debt instruments since it is directed at borrowers?\n'ANSWER': The statute does not explicitly state that, but it can be interpreted that way. The theoretical limit of the statute has not been explored. The purpose of the statute is to replace lending and provide credit when the market is not functioning. The framework should be followed accordingly.", "'QUESTION': What is the Fed's view on companies cutting wages and salaries during the crisis and its impact on inflation?\n'ANSWER': The Fed believes that the significant wage cuts indicate a long road to labor market recovery. Despite recent job creation, there are still 14 million unemployed people and a partially reopened economy. With a large pool of job seekers, there will be limited upward pressure on wages. Restoring the labor force and supporting those who lost their jobs is crucial.", "'QUESTION': Do you see merits to tying your asset purchases to economic outcomes, including both inflation and labor market conditions? And what conditions would you want to see in the labor market before considering pulling back stimulus?\n\n'ANSWER': We have discussed this in past meetings and will continue to do so in the future. We haven't made any decisions yet. There are different approaches, such as tying asset purchases to specific dates or achieving certain macroeconomic goals. It depends on the situation, and we haven't made any decisions on this matter yet.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that revising the Collins Amendment to ease the tier 1 leverage ratio for banks in the stimulus bill will deplete bank capital?\n'ANSWER': The stress tests showed that banks passed under regular scenarios, but the pandemic introduced severe scenarios where some banks didn't pass. We used the provision to ask banks to resubmit their capital plans and implemented measures like stopping buybacks and limiting dividends. If Congress chooses to revise the amendment, it should be explicitly temporary to allow banks to grow their balance sheets and serve customers better, as many other regulators have done.", "'QUESTION': How does the framework review relate to the discussion on explicit forward guidance and when will the findings be announced?\n'ANSWER': The completion of the review is a high priority and will inform future actions. The changes to the Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy will codify existing policies. The timing of the announcement is uncertain, but it is a sensible approach."]}
