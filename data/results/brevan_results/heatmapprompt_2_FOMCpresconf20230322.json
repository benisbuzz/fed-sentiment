Colby Smith with the Financial Times .  How confident is the Committee that the recent stress that we \u2019ve seen, and you\u2019 ve alluded to, is contained at this point and that deposit flight among midsize lenders in particular has ceased?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Thanks .  So I, I guess our view is that the banking system is sound and it \u2019s resilient \u2014it\u2019s got strong capital [and] liquidity.   We took powerful actions wit h [the] Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors \u2019 savings are safe and that the banking system is safe.  Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week.  And the last thing I \u2019ll say is that we \u2019ve undertaken\u2014we \u2019re undertaking a thorough internal review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Okay, just a quick follow -up:  I mean , given all the stress and the uncertainty that you\u2019 ve also alluded to in the statement, how seriously was a \u2014was a pause considered for this meeting?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So we considered \u2014we did consider that in the days running up to the meeting , and you see the decision that we made, which I \u2019ll say a couple things about.   First, it was supported by a very strong consensus , and I \u2019ll be happy to explain why.  A nd, really , it is that the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and, really, before the recent events, we were clearly on track to cont inue with ongoing rate hikes.  In fact, as of a couple of weeks ago, it looked like we \u2019d need to raise rates over the course of the    year more than we had expected at the time of the SEP in December \u2014at the time of the December meeting.  We are committed to restoring price stability , and all of the evidence says that the public has confidence that we will do so \u2014that we \u2019ll bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.   It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words.  So we also assess, as I mentioned, that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result in some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on demand, on the labor market , and on inflation.  Such a tightening in financial conditions would work in the same direction as rate tightening.  In principle , as a matter of fact, you can think of it as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that ; of course , it\u2019s not possible to make that assessment today with any pr ecision whatsoever.   So our decision was to move ahead with the 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance, as I mentioned, from ongoing hikes to some , some  additional hikes maybe \u2014some policy firming may be appropriate.  So going forward, as I mentione d, in assessing the need for , for further hikes, we \u2019ll be focused as always on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and, in particular , on our assessment of the actual and expected effects of credit tightening\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, can you explain the difference between ongoing rate increases and firming ?  Does firming imply a rate increase per se, or could policy firm without you increasing rates?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: No, I think it \u2019s, it\u2019s meant to refer to our policy rate.  Really , I would focus on, on  the wor ds \u201cmay\u201d and \u201c some, \u201d as opposed to \u201c ongoing.\u201d   Ongoing.  So we , we clearly were \u2014what we were doing there was taking onboard the \u2014trying to reflect the uncertainty about what will happen.   I mean , it, it\u2019s possible that this will turn out to have very    modest effects\u2014that these events will turn out to be very, very modest effects on the economy, in which case inflation will continue to be strong \u2014in which case, you know , the path will look \u2014might look differe nt.  It \u2019s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant tightening in credit conditions over time and, in principle, if that\u2014that means that monetary policy may have less work to do.  We simply don \u2019t know.  So.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Do you have concerns th at the recent \u2014that the hike you did today could further exacerbate the problem in the banks?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: No .  I mean , with our monetary policy, we\u2019re , we\u2019re really focused on macroeconomic outcomes .  In particular , we\u2019re focused on , on this potential credit tightening and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions.  I think when we think about the situation with the banks, we \u2019re focused on our \u2014on our  financial stability tools , in particular our lending facilities, the debt \u2014sorry, the discount window , and also the new facility.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, in your testimony two weeks ago, you had indicated you thought the terminal rate would be higher.  Obviously, that was before the stress in the banking sector.  And I realize there \u2019s a lot of uncertainty, but can you \u2014can you explain at all to what extent your forecasts or those of your colleagues or those of the Board staff incorporated today a material tightening of credit availability because of the stress in the banking sector , or are you waiting to see it in the data before you incorporate that potential tightening into your forecasts?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, you know , we have just come fr om an FOMC meeting and, you know , the people who write the minutes will be very carefully counting, but I\u2019 ll tell you what I heard .  What I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated there would    be some , some  tightening of credit c onditions and that would really have the same e ffects as, as our policies do, a nd that therefore  they were including that in their assessment and that if that did turn out not to be the case, in principle you would need more rate hikes.  So some people did reflect that in their FOMC\u2014in their SEP forecasts.  I think there may also just have been \u2014rememb er, this is 12 days ago.  Y ou know , we\u2019re trying to assess something that just is so recent and it \u2019s people \u2014you know , it\u2019s very difficult, there \u2019s so much uncertainty.  So  December was a good place to start , and we wound up with\u2014we wound up with very simil ar outcomes for December.  And, you know , in a way, the early\u2014 the data in the first part \u2014the first five weeks of the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor market s.  So that pointed to higher rates .  And then this , this latter part kind of \u2014the possibility of credit conditions tightening really, really offset that, effectively.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: To follow  up:  H ave you considered at all whether your primary tool, the funds rate, is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighte r financial conditions that you believe will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector?  Have you, for example, considered changing reserve requirements, selling assets out of the S ystem O pen Market A ccount, as a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don\u2019 t accelerate deposit erosion, for example , from banks?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Y ou know , we know that we have other , other  tools in effect, but no, we think our monetary policy tool works , and we think, you know , many, many banks \u2014our rate hikes were well  telegraphed to the market , and many banks have managed to handle them.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Victoria Guid a with Politico.   I wanted to ask \u2014you, along with the FDIC and the Treasury\u2014t he Fed Board decided to invoke the systemic risk exception to    allow uninsured depositors to be protected at these two banks.  I was just wondering if you could speak to why that decision was made.  Was it purely a confidence issue, or was there a concern that there would be some sort of economic contagion or financial contagion from the failure of these banks?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the risk of a contagion to, to  other banks and to the financial market s more broadly.  That was the issue.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Okay, and then can you also\u2014just to follow  up, can you speak to the role that you will be playing in the F ed\u2019s internal investigation on its supervision and regulation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So Vice Chair Barr is, is of course leading that review.  And he \u2019s responsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for Supervision.  We\u2014I realized , you know , right away that , that there was going to be a need for review.  I mean , the question we \u2019re all asking ourselves  over that first weekend was, how did this happen?  And so what we did was, early Monday morning, we sat down and said, \u201cL et\u2019s do this .\u201d  And he, he was obviously going to lead it in his capacity.  So I don\u2019 t\u2014my role was to announce it , and I get briefed on it , but I \u2019m not involved in, in the work of it.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Howard Schneider from Reuters.   So I want to go back to your February press conference .  You mentioned the word \u201cdisinflation ,\u201d I believe, 9 or 10 times, a process that you felt was\u2014I forget the word you used\u2014but gratefully under  way , or something like that.  Is disinflation still occurring in the U.S. today?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Yes .  I mean, what actually happened, Howard, was I got the question 12 times, so it\u2019s \u2014maybe it \u2019s a feature, not a bug.  But , so, but yeah, absolutely the same\u2014 the story is intact , so it \u2019s really three parts, right?  Goods inflation has been coming down now for six months ; it\u2019s proceeding more slowly than we would have liked, but it \u2019s certainly proceeding.  Housing services is, is  really a matter of time passing .  We continue to see the new leases being signed at much lower levels of inflation.  So that \u2019s 44 percent of the \u2014of the core PCE index, where you\u2019 ve got  a story that \u2019s ongoing.  Wh ere we didn\u2019 t have in February, and we still don \u2019t have now, is a sign of progress in the nonhousing services sector.  And that is, you know , that \u2019s just something that will have to come through softening demand and perhaps some softening in labor market conditions .  We don\u2019 t see that yet.   And that\u2019s, that\u2019s of course 56 percent of the index.  So the story is pretty much the same.  I will say that the inflation data that we got, to your point, really pointed to stronger inflation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could follow  up on that, I was curious why you don\u2019 t see more coming from the credit crunch , because it seems to me that \u2019s something that you\u2019d  actually welcome to a degree and expect.  And are you not seeing more coming from that because you don\u2019t know, or because you just don\u2019 t want to have another round of wishful thinking?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So it \u2019s really just a question of not knowing at this point.  There \u2019s a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity, hiring, and inflation.  Very large body of literature.  The question is, how significant will this credit tightening be and how sustainable it will be ?  That \u2019s, that\u2019s the issue.  And we don\u2019 t really see it yet, so , so people are making estimates, you know , people are publishing estimates , but it \u2019s very kind of rule -of-thumb guesswork almost at this point.  But we think  it\u2019s, it\u2019s potentially    quite real and that argues for, you know , being alert as we go forward .  As we think about further rate hikes for us, we\u2019 ll be paying attention to the actual and expected effects from that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek  from the New York Times.  Thank you for taking our questions.  I wonder if you could talk a little bit \u2014I know that you\u2019 ve got your internal review coming, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you think happened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and whether thi s suggests that something about regulation and supervision needs to actual ly change going forward.  And I wonder, you know , how can the American people have confidence that there aren \u2019t other weaknesses out there in the banking system, given that this one got missed, as you noted?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So let me say what , what I think happened, and then I \u2019ll come to the questions around supervision.  So, at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly\u2014they grew the bank very quickly, they expose d the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk, didn \u2019t hedge that risk.  We now know that supervisors saw these risks and, and intervened.  We know that the public saw all this.  We know that SVB experienced an unprecedentedly rapid and mas sive bank run.  So this is a \u2014this is a very large group of connected depositors \u2014concentrated group of connected depositors in a very, very fast run, faster than historical record would suggest.  So as for us \u2014so for our part, we \u2019re doing a review of supervi sion and regulation.  M y only interest is that we identify what went wrong here.  How did this happen is the question.  What went wrong?   Try to find that.  We will find that.  And then make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so t hat it doesn \u2019t happen again, and then implement those policies.  It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my views on what the answers might be.  You know , I simply can \u2019t do that.  Vice Chair Barr is    leading this, and I think he \u2019s testifying  next week.  So \u2014but that will be up to him.  So that \u2019s really where it is .  You know , the, the review is going to be thorough and transparent.  It is clear \u2014really to your last question\u2014 it\u2019s clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and regulation.  And I , I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report, and I , I plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And the final point \u2014you know , can we feel confident that these weaknesses don \u2019t exist elsew here, given that they got missed at this bank?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: These are not weaknesses that are\u2014that are at all broadly through the banking system.  This was\u2014this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its percentage of , of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk.  And again, supervisors did get in there , and, and they were, as you know , obviously, you know they were \u2014they were on this issue, but nonetheless, this , this  still happened.  And so that \u2019s really the nature of the  interview \u2014sorry, of the review \u2014is to discover that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  You \u2019ve been very consistent in saying that the F ed would be raising interest rates and then holding them there for quite some time.  Following today\u2019 s decision, the markets have now priced in one more increase in May , and then every meeting the rest of this year they \u2019re pricing in rate cuts.  Are they getting this totally wrong from the Fed, or is there something different about the way you\u2019 re looking at it, given that you\u2019 re now thinking that moves might be appropriate as opposed to ongoing?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we published an SEP today, as you will have seen, and it shows that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and    demand in the  labor market, with inflation moving down gradually.  In that most likely  case, if that happens, participants don\u2019 t see rate cuts this year.  They just don\u2019 t.  I would just say:  A s always, the path of the economy is uncertain, and policy is going to reflect what actually happens rather than what we write down in the SEP.  But that \u2019s not our baseline expectation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Well , if I could follow  up and ask, as you look forward into the rest of the year here, are you saying that what you see and the 5.1 percent basically consensus is based on being\u2014it will be sufficiently restrictive?  Or is it leavened by the idea of you don\u2019 t know what's going to happen?  In other words, what should people think about in terms of how the F ed thinks about how far it is from the terminal?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: It\u2019 s going to depend.  R emember, we \u2019re looking\u2014for purposes of our monetary polic y tool , we\u2019re looking at what \u2019s happening among the banks and asking, is there going to be some tightening in credit conditions ?  And then we \u2019re thinking about that as effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do.  So , in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes. So, the key is, we have to have \u2014policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.  It doesn \u2019t all have to come from rate hikes :  It can come from , you know , from tighter credit con ditions.  So we \u2019re looking at, and we , we\u2014it\u2019s highly uncertain how long the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those e ffects would be, so we \u2019re just going to have to watch.  In the meantime, you know \u2014obviously, at the end of the day, we  will do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent.  No one should doubt that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thank you for taking our questions.  I know we \u2019ve tal ked a bit about how Silicon Valley Bank was unique to a certain sector of the economy, but there \u2019s also growing concern that there are    financial stability risks from the commercial  real estate market and loans that will begin to roll over later this year a nd next, and that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those loans.  Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of \u2014what we saw with SVB to banks that disproportionately are focused in commercial real estate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , you know , we\u2019re well  aware of the concentrations people have in commercial real estate .  I really don\u2019 t think it \u2019s comparable to this.  The, the banking system is , is strong, it is sound, it is resilient, it \u2019s well  capitalized , and I really don \u2019t see that as at all analogous to this.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And one other question :  Would you be open to an independent investigation, separate from the F ed\u2019s probe?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I welcome\u2014it \u2019s 100 percent certainty that there will be independent investigations and outside invest igations and all that.  So we welcome\u2014 when a bank fails, there are investigations .  And, of course , we welcome that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from F ox Business.  Inflation has been rather sticky , so do you need help from the fiscal side to get inflation down faster?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  We don\u2019 t assume that.  We don \u2019t give advice to the fiscal authorities, and we assume that \u2014we take fiscal policy as, as it comes to our front door, s tick it in our model along with a million other things .  We have responsibility for price stability.  The Federal Reserve has responsibility for that.  And nothing\u2019 s going to change that.  So\u2014and we will get inflation down to 2 percent in time.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And if I  can follow on that, but they\u2019 re working\u2014the spending that \u2019s happened is working against what you are doing, right?  So it \u2019s prolonging inflation.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You have to look at , at the impulse from spending because spending was, of course , tremendousl y high during the pandemic , and then, as the pandemic programs rolled off, spending actually came down, so the \u2014this sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what\u2019 s driving inflation right now.  It was \u2014it was at the beginning perhaps part of what was driving inflation, but that \u2019s not really the story now\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.   Two questions about aspects of the government \u2019s response on Silicon Valley Bank two weekends ago.  First, why i s this new bank funding facility done under e mergency 13 (3) authority,  as opposed to expansion of the discount window, changing the terms of the discount window that \u2019s been around a long time?  And, second, can you discuss the Fed \u2019s role in the \u2014in the  FDIC guarantee of uninsured depositors and why there \u2019s $143 billion on your balance sheet s last week, supporting that deposit guarantee?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure .  So 13( 3) seemed like the right \u2014we have a little more flexibility under s ection 13( 3).  We \u2019ve done quite a lot under the discount window as well.  We needed to do a special facility that was designed a certain way , so we did it under 13( 3).  Really no magic to that.

I have a couple questions about the balance sheet.  First of all, I\u2019 m curious at what point the financial supports that the Fed  is extending through the discount window and through its enhanced lending facility might be at odds with the objective of reduci ng the balance sheet.  And I \u2019m also curious what your thoughts are on the \u2014not just the availability    of reserves but the distribution of them throughout the banking system and at what point you might be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So \u2014People think of QE and QT in different ways, so let me be clear about how I \u2019m thinking about these recent developments.  So the recent liquidity provision that has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different from what we \u2014from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer -term securities.  Large -scale purchases of long -term securities are , are really meant to alter the stance of policy by pushing down\u2014pushing up the price and down the rates, longer -term rates, which supports demand through channels we understand fairly well.  The balance sheet expansion is really temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions ; it\u2019s not inte nded to directly alter the stance of monetary policy.  We do believe that it \u2019s working.  I t\u2019s having its intended effect of bolstering confidence in the banking system and thereby forestalling what might otherwise have been an abrupt and outsized tightening in financial conditions.  So that \u2019s working. In terms of the distribution of reserves, we , we don\u2019 t see ourselves as, as running into reserve shortages.  W e, we think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to , to run off predictably , predicatbly  and passively is working.  And of course we\u2019re , we\u2019re always prepared to, to change that if that changes.  B ut we don\u2019 t see any evidence that that \u2019s changed.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Chair.  Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.  The minutes of the January\u2013 February meeting, the last meeting, indicate that you discussed the possibility of runs on nonbank financial institutions and the impact of large unrealized losses on bank portfolios.  Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion \u2014kind of what was talked    about in light of that, and then why didn\u2019 t the Fed , you know , do anything about that at that point to ultimately prevent, you know , what happened this month?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I mean, to be honest, I don \u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t recall the specifics of that.  It\u2019 s been  quite an interesting seven weeks.  But , but I will tell you , though, that we have \u2014there have been presentations about , about interest rate risk.  I mean , it\u2019s been in all the newspapers.  I t\u2019s not a surprise that th ere are institutions that have \u2014that have had unhedged long positions in long-duration securities that have lost value as, as longer -term rates have gone up due to our rate increases.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  not a surprise.   I, I think, as you know, as  is now in  the public record, the supervisory team was apparently engaged, very much engaged with the bank repeatedly, and was escalating but , you know , nonetheless, what happened happened.  A nd so that \u2019s really the purpose of \u2014one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Barr is conducting is to try to understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we need to change.  I mean , one thing is the speed of the \u2014I\u2019ll come back to that, the speed of the run, it \u2019s very diff erent from what we \u2019ve seen in the past , and it does kind of suggest that there \u2019s a need for possible , you know , regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision and regulation need to keep up with what\u2019s , what \u2019s happening in the world.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Can you confirm whether or not the Board knew about these escalations by the examiners in San Francisco?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I will have to come back to you on that.

Chair Powell, you stated twice today that all depositors \u2019 savings in the banking system are safe.  Are you saying that de facto deposit insurance covers all savings?  Shouldn\u2019 t Congress    have a say in that ?  and, just by way of example, if a bank with less than $1  billion in assets failed , are you promising to bail out all of its depositors?  Thanks \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, I \u2019m not saying anything more than I \u2019m saying.  So\u2014but what I\u2019m saying is you\u2019 ve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there \u2019s a threat of serious harm to the economy or to \u2014or to the financial system , and we \u2019re prepared to use those tools.

So, you know , we\u2014that was really the Swiss government that we of course were, were  following it over the course of the weekend, and we were engaged with their authorities in the way that you would expect, all the ways that you would expect.  It seems to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to , and it  has been \u2014the markets have accepted it , and it seems to have gone well , and I think there was a concern that it might not go well.

I\u2019m wondering how you anticipate preventing this from snowballing w hile using the admittedly blunt tools at your disposal .\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So that \u2019s just \u2014that\u2019s an estimate of what will happen as demand slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it \u2019s just \u2014it\u2019 s a highly uncertain estimate.  And, I mean, I was r eally \u2014we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent.  The cost s of bringing it down\u2014there are real costs to bring ing it down to 2 percent, but the cost s of failing are much higher.  And if you read your history,  as I\u2019m sure you have, you can see that if  the c entral bank doesn\u2019 t get inflation back in place, get inflation \u2014make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile , and it \u2019s hard to invest capital, it \u2019s hard for an economy t o perform well.

Y ou know , the models all work in a kind of linear way\u2014if you have more of this, you get more of tha t.  But when a recession happens, the reactions tend to be nonlinear and that \u2019s what \u2014so we don\u2019 t know whether that \u2019ll happen this time.  We don\u2019 t know \u2014if so, we don\u2019 t know how significant it will be , and so, you know , we\u2019re very focused on getting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most benefit the people we serve.  That \u2019s how we can have a long \u2014you know, we \u2019ve had very strong    labor markets through these long expansions that w e\u2019ve had.  Four of the five longest, or three of the four longest expansions in U.S. history have been really since the high -inflation period.  And the reason was inflation wasn \u2019t forcing the c entral bank to come in and stop an incipient or , or, you know , an expansion.   You can  have very, very long expansions without high inflation, and we had several of those , and they\u2019 re very good for people.  You see late in an expansion\u2014you see low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower  end of the wage spectrum .

I just wanted to ask, with all the events of the past two weeks, do you still see a possibi lity of a soft landing for the U.S. economy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know it\u2019s , it\u2019s too early to say , really , whether these events have had much of an effect.  It\u2019s hard for me to see how they would have helped the possibility\u2014but I guess I would just say, it\u2019s too early to say whether there really have been changes in that.  Y ou know , the question will be how long this period is sustained.  The longer it \u2019s sustained, then the greater will be the likely declines in \u2014or tightening in credit standards, credit availability, so we\u2019ll just have to see.  I do still think , though, that there \u2019s a\u2014 there\u2019s a  pathway to that.

So financial conditions seem to have tightened\u2014and probably by more than the traditional indexes say , because traditional indexes are focused a lot on  [interest] rates and [prices of] equities, and they don\u2019 t necessarily capture lending conditions .  So we think that, though.  So there are other measures which, if they \u2019re focused on , you know \u2014bank lending conditions and things like that \u2014they show some more tighteni ng.  The question for us , though, is, how significant will that be and how, you know \u2014what will be the extent of it and what will be the duration of it?  And then\u2014and then, you know , once you have \u2014once you know that , there \u2019s a fair amount of research about how that , with broad uncertainty bands \u2014how that works its way into the economy [and] over what period of time.  And so, you know , we\u2019ll be looking to see the first part of that \u2014like how serious is this, and does it look like it \u2019s going to be sustained, and if it is,  you know , it could easily have a significant macroeconomic e ffect, and we would factor that into our policy decisions.

To protect the economy and strengthen public confidence, the Federal Reserve, along with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, has taken decisive actions, ensuring the safety of all depositors' savings and the banking system.The Federal Reserve will closely monitor the banking system and use all necessary tools to ensure its safety. They are committed to learning from past episodes and preventing them from happening again. Inflation remains high and the labor market is tight, causing hardship, but the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to their 2 percent goal. Price stability is crucial for a functioning economy and without it, sustained strong labor market conditions cannot be achieved. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, but consumer spending appears to have picked up this quarter.Despite weak activity in the housing sector and slower output growth, the labor market remains tight with job gains increasing and the unemployment rate remaining low. However, subdued growth is expected to continue and risks to GDP growth are seen as weighted to the downside.FOMC participants expect labor market conditions to improve, easing upward pressures on wages and prices. However, inflation remains above the desired goal, with recent readings indicating continued high inflation pressures.The Fed is committed to promoting maximum employment and stable prices, but is aware that high inflation can harm those least able to afford it. They have raised the federal funds rate and are reducing their securities holdings, but are cautious about the potential effects of tighter credit conditions and will closely monitor data to inform future policy decisions.The FOMC participants have projected the appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on their judgment of the most likely scenario, with little change from previous projections. However, these projections are not set in stone and will adjust as necessary to achieve maximum employment and price stability goals.The Federal Reserve is committed to taking all necessary measures to reach our objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Thank you, and I am eager to address any inquiries you may have.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': How confident is the Committee that the recent stress is contained and deposit flight among midsize lenders has ceased?\n'ANSWER': The Committee believes that the banking system is sound and resilient, with strong capital and liquidity. Powerful actions have been taken to ensure the safety of depositors' savings and the banking system. Deposit flows have stabilized, and a thorough internal review is being conducted to strengthen supervision and regulation.", "'QUESTION': How seriously was a pause considered for this meeting given the stress and uncertainty mentioned in the statement?\n'ANSWER': We did consider a pause before the meeting, but the decision to raise rates was supported by a strong consensus. The intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected, and we were on track for ongoing rate hikes. However, recent events may result in tightening credit conditions, which could weigh on demand, the labor market, and inflation. We decided to proceed with a 25 basis point hike and change our guidance to some additional hikes may be appropriate. We will assess the need for further hikes based on incoming data and the effects of credit tightening.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain the difference between ongoing rate increases and firming? Does firming imply a rate increase per se, or could policy firm without you increasing rates?\n'ANSWER': Firming refers to the policy rate and may or may not involve rate increases. The use of \"may\" and \"some\" instead of \"ongoing\" reflects uncertainty about the future. The effects of events on the economy could be modest or significant, which would impact the path of monetary policy. The extent of tightening and its impact on credit conditions is still unknown.", "'QUESTION': Do you have concerns that the recent hike could worsen the problem in banks?\n'ANSWER': No, our focus is on macroeconomic outcomes and the potential credit tightening. We are primarily concerned with financial stability and have tools such as lending facilities, the discount window, and a new facility to address any issues with banks.", "QUESTION: Can you explain to what extent the forecasts of the FOMC incorporated a potential tightening of credit availability due to stress in the banking sector?\nANSWER: Some FOMC members included the potential tightening of credit conditions in their forecasts, as they believed it would have similar effects as their policies. However, there is still uncertainty and the recent stress in the banking sector makes it difficult to assess. The early data pointed to higher rates, but the possibility of credit conditions tightening offset that.", "'QUESTION': Have you considered if the funds rate is enough to sustain tight financial conditions without damaging the banking sector? Have you considered changing reserve requirements or selling assets to achieve tighter conditions without eroding deposits from banks?\n'ANSWER': We believe our monetary policy tool works and many banks have managed to handle our rate hikes, which were well communicated to the market. We are aware of other tools but currently believe the funds rate is sufficient.", "'QUESTION': Was the decision to protect uninsured depositors at these two banks made due to a confidence issue or concern about economic/financial contagion?\n'ANSWER': The decision was made to protect uninsured depositors not because of the specific banks, but because of the risk of contagion to other banks and the broader financial markets.", "'QUESTION': Can you speak to the role you will be playing in the Fed's internal investigation on its supervision and regulation?\n'ANSWER': Vice Chair Barr is leading the review as Vice Chair for Supervision. The need for review was recognized immediately, and the decision to conduct it was made early Monday morning. Chair Powell's role is to announce it, get briefed on it, but not be involved in the actual work of the investigation.", "'QUESTION': Is disinflation still occurring in the U.S. today?\n'ANSWER': Yes, disinflation is still occurring in the U.S. Goods inflation has been decreasing for six months, housing services show signs of lower inflation, but there is no progress in the nonhousing services sector. Overall, the story remains the same, although recent inflation data suggests stronger inflation.", "'QUESTION': Why don't you see more coming from the credit crunch and is it because you don't know or because you don't want to have wishful thinking?\n'ANSWER': It is a matter of not knowing at this point. There is a large body of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions and economic activity, but the significance and sustainability of this credit tightening is uncertain. While estimates are being made, it is still guesswork. However, we believe it could be quite real and we will be alert to its effects as we consider further rate hikes.", "'QUESTION': What do you think happened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and does this suggest a need for changes in regulation and supervision?\n'ANSWER': Silicon Valley Bank management failed by exposing the bank to liquidity and interest rate risks without hedging. Supervisors intervened, but a rapid and massive bank run still occurred. The Federal Reserve is conducting a review to identify what went wrong and will implement appropriate policies to prevent a recurrence. Strengthening supervision and regulation is necessary, and recommendations from the review will be supported and implemented.", "'QUESTION': Can we be confident that these weaknesses don't exist elsewhere in the banking system?\n'ANSWER': These weaknesses are not widespread in the banking system. The bank in question had a high percentage of uninsured deposits and held a significant amount of duration risk, making it an outlier. Supervisors were aware of the issue but the review aims to uncover the nature of the problem.", "'QUESTION': Are the markets wrong in pricing in rate cuts for the rest of the year?\n'ANSWER': The participants in the FOMC don't see rate cuts this year in the most likely scenario of slow growth, gradual rebalancing of the labor market, and inflation moving down gradually. However, the path of the economy is uncertain, and policy will reflect actual developments rather than what is written in the SEP.", "'QUESTION': Are you saying that the consensus of 5.1 percent is based on sufficient restriction or is it influenced by uncertainty?\n'ANSWER': It depends on the tightening of credit conditions among banks, which can substitute for rate hikes. The goal is to bring inflation down to 2 percent, and it doesn't have to solely come from rate hikes. The duration and significance of these effects are uncertain, so we will monitor the situation and take necessary actions to achieve our inflation target.", "'QUESTION': Is there a risk that the commercial real estate market and loans could pose a financial stability risk to smaller regional banks?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell does not believe that the risk from commercial real estate loans is comparable to the situation with Silicon Valley Bank. He states that the banking system is strong, sound, resilient, and well capitalized, and does not see it as a significant concern.", "'QUESTION': Would you be open to an independent investigation, separate from the Fed's probe?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell welcomes independent and outside investigations, stating that it is certain to happen. He compares it to investigations that occur when a bank fails, emphasizing the Fed's openness to such inquiries.", "'QUESTION': Do you need help from the fiscal side to get inflation down faster?\n'ANSWER': We don't assume that and we don't give advice to fiscal authorities. We have responsibility for price stability and will get inflation down to 2 percent in time.", "'QUESTION': Is the spending that has happened prolonging inflation and working against what the FOMC is doing?\n'ANSWER': The high spending during the pandemic was initially driving inflation, but as the pandemic programs ended, spending actually decreased. Therefore, the current inflation is not being driven by the fiscal impulse from spending.", "'QUESTION': Why was the new bank funding facility done under emergency 13(3) authority instead of expanding the discount window?\n'ANSWER': The emergency 13(3) authority provides more flexibility and was necessary for creating a special facility with specific design requirements. The discount window has also been utilized, but 13(3) seemed appropriate for this situation.", "'QUESTION': Do you feel that if inflation remains high, you'll be able to resume additional rate hikes or have you tied your hands with signals about rate hikes coming to an end?\n'ANSWER': No, we have not tied our hands. If we need to raise rates higher, we will. We are monitoring credit tightening, its impact on the economy, and watching inflation and the labor market. We will eventually reach a policy that brings inflation down to 2 percent.", "QUESTION: At what point might the financial supports extended by the Fed through the discount window and enhanced lending facility conflict with the objective of reducing the balance sheet? And what are your thoughts on the availability and distribution of reserves throughout the banking system?\n\nANSWER: The recent liquidity provision through the balance sheet expansion is temporary lending to meet special liquidity demands, not intended to directly alter monetary policy. It is working to bolster confidence in the banking system and prevent abrupt tightening in financial conditions. There is no evidence of reserve shortages or a need to change the current balance sheet strategy.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk about the discussion on runs on nonbank financial institutions and the impact of unrealized losses on bank portfolios during the January-February meeting, and why the Fed didn't take action to prevent what happened this month?\n'ANSWER': I don't recall the specifics, but there have been presentations on interest rate risk. It's not surprising that institutions with unhedged long positions in long-duration securities have suffered losses as rates increased. The supervisory team was engaged with the bank, but we need to understand how this happened and make necessary policy changes to keep up with the changing world.", "'QUESTION': Can you confirm whether or not the Board knew about these escalations by the examiners in San Francisco?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell stated that he is unsure and will need to provide a response later.", "'QUESTION': Are all depositors' savings in the banking system safe and does de facto deposit insurance cover all savings? Should Congress have a say in this? Will the Fed bail out depositors if a bank with less than $1 billion in assets fails?\n\n'ANSWER': The Fed has the tools to protect depositors in case of serious harm to the economy or financial system and is prepared to use them. Depositors should assume their deposits are safe. No further clarification is provided.", "'QUESTION': Was the Credit Suisse merger a relief for the Federal Reserve?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve was engaged with the Swiss government during the weekend and the merger seems to have been a positive outcome. The markets have accepted it and so far it has gone well.", "'QUESTION': How does the FOMC plan to prevent the increase in unemployment rate from snowballing with limited tools at their disposal?\n'ANSWER': The estimate of the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5 percent is uncertain, but the central bank aims to bring inflation down to 2 percent. While there are costs to achieving this, the costs of failing to control inflation are much higher. The goal is to avoid a prolonged period of high and volatile inflation and return to a stable economy as quickly as possible.", "'QUESTION': Do you worry about a snowball effect in containing unemployment and how do you factor that into your projections?\n'ANSWER': Recessions are hard to model as they tend to be nonlinear. We don't know if it will happen this time or how significant it will be. Our focus is on getting inflation down, as that benefits the people we serve. Long expansions without high inflation are good for people, with low unemployment and wage benefits for those at the lower end. We should aim to get back to that.", "'QUESTION': Do you still see a possibility of a soft landing for the U.S. economy?\n'ANSWER': It's too early to determine the impact of recent events on the possibility of a soft landing. The duration of this period will determine the extent of declines in credit standards and availability. However, I still believe there is a pathway to a soft landing and we are actively working towards it.", "'QUESTION': How many financial institutions have been issued matters requiring attention or matters requiring immediate attention citations at this point?\n'ANSWER': I don't know the exact number, but there have been six financial institutions that have received serious regulatory citations, particularly those requiring immediate attention.", "'QUESTION': How will the Federal Reserve ensure that banks comply with citations and take them seriously?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell acknowledges the importance of this question and states that it will be addressed in the review led by Vice Chair Barr. However, he clarifies that he cannot provide an answer at this moment.", "'QUESTION': Do you have specific thoughts on that?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell stated that he would not share his thoughts on the matter because a review is currently underway to determine what happened, why it happened, and how to improve. He emphasized the importance of not providing half-formed or partially informed thoughts and expressed confidence in the review led by Vice Chair Barr.", "'QUESTION': How do you view financial conditions right now? Would a situation of expensive credit warrant a rate cut? What situation would warrant a rate cut? Have bank failures prompted discussion on changing the balance sheet runoff implementation?\n\n'ANSWER': We haven't discussed changing the balance sheet implementation yet. We are open to it if necessary, but currently, we don't see any signs that warrant a change. Regarding rate cuts, we would consider it if credit becomes expensive enough to choke off growth. Bank failures have not prompted discussions on changing the balance sheet runoff implementation.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve view current financial conditions and would a tightening of credit prompt a rate cut?\n'ANSWER': Financial conditions have tightened, potentially more than traditional indexes indicate. Other measures, such as bank lending conditions, show further tightening. The extent and duration of this tightening will determine its significance. If sustained, it could have a significant macroeconomic effect and be factored into policy decisions, although rate cuts are not currently expected."]}
