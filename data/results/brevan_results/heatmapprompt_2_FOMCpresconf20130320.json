Ylan Mui, Washington Post .  My question is around QE.  Obviously, we\u2019ve seen some of your colleagues give more -specific criteria, give some color around what they\u2019re looking for before they would consider exiting from QE.  Can you give us any additional color on what you\u2019 re looking for specifically in terms of substantial improvement in  the labor market?  And does the fact that there aren \u2019t thresholds associated with QE say anything about the level of disagreement among the C ommittee members over what that exit should look like?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, to  take your second question first , the lack of thresholds comes from the complexity of the problem.  On the one  hand, we have benefits, which are associated with improvements in the economy, but there are also costs associated with unconventional policy, such as potential effects o n financial stability, which are hard to quantify and which people have different vie ws about.  So , to this point, we \u2019ve not been able to give quantitative thresholds for the asset purchases in the same way that we have for the federal funds rate target.  We \u2019re going to continue to try to provide information as we go forward.  In particula r, as I mentioned today, as we make progress towards our objective, we may adjust the flow rate of purchases month to month to appropriately calibrate the amount of accommodation we\u2019re providing given the outlook for the labor market.   In terms of further color, again, given the complexity of the issue, we \u2019ve not given quantitative analysis or quantitative thresholds.  I would say that we \u2019ll be looking for sustained March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   6 of 26 improvement in a range of key labor market indicators, including , obviously , payrolls, unemployment rate, but also others like the hiring rate, claims for unemployment insurance, quit rates, wage rates, and so on.  We \u2019ll be looking for sustained improvement across a range of indicators , and in a way that \u2019s taking place throughout the economy.  And since we \u2019re looking at the outlook\u2014we \u2019re looking at the prospects rather than the current state of the labor market \u2014 we\u2019ll also be looking at things like growth to try to understand whether there \u2019s sufficient momentum in the economy to pr ovide demand for labor going forward.  So that will allow us to look through, perhaps, some temporary fluctuations associated with short- term shocks or problems. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, to follow up on that last point, what \u2014you referred to the possibility of varying purchases , the rates of purchases per month.  W hat\u2019s the difference in the conditions that would induce you to do that , as opposed to the substantial improvements in the labor market that would induce you to stop the program altogether?  Thank you. \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, the problem with having just a single criterion is that it\u2019s all or nothing.  We maintain full spe ed ahead until we hit a certain target, and then, you know, we stop.  That would be , I think, very difficult for the markets to understand, to anticipate.  We think it makes more sense to have our policy variable , which is the rate of flow of purchases , respond in a more continuous or sensitive way to changes in the outlook.  So, as we make progress towards our ultimate objective of substantial improvement, we may adjust the rate of flow of purchases accordingly.  Now, we won \u2019t do that every meeting ; we won \u2019t do that frequently .  But when we see that the condition or the situation has changed in a  meaningful way, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   7 of 26 consistent with the outlook, a nd, secondly, to help provide the markets with some sense of progress \u2014how much progress is being made so that it can make better judgments. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Could you define \u201c progress towards \u201d at all , how you deal with that?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, you know, as I just described what I mean by \u201csubstantial improvement,\u201d  it\u2019s a broad -based improvement in a range of indicators as well as improvement in output and  labor demand.  So, as we move \u2014we see partial improvements, see modest improvement , as we see a per iod in which the labor market is doing better, and we have reason to think it might be stronger, then we might reduce accommodation at that point.  But it works in both directions .  If, subsequently , the labor market were to weaken, the outlook were to get worse, we could, of course , bring back accommodation back to the previous level. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Liesman from CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, I have to keep coming back to this issue of adjusting the flow rate .  Are we near that time right now?  And how can the markets calibrate the number to changes in economic i mprovement ?  For example, let \u2019s say , theoretically , we did 236,000 jobs in a month, and the unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percent .  Would that be sufficient to begin to adjust the purchas es downward?  Thank you. \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, that\u2019 s going to be obviously a decision that the Committee has to make , and we will \u2014at each meeting, we\u2019 ll look at progress  that\u2019s been made since the last meeting, try to assess the outlook, try to dete rmine whether there \u2019s been a sufficient change to warrant  a change in our policy stance.  Internally, we \u2019ll use models and other indicators of the state of the labor market to try to make a good estimate of how much we need to change the rate of flow.  But, again, the point of this is to let the market see our behavior , to let them see how we respond to changes in the outlook.  A nd that way there will be a better ability, I March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   8 of 26 hope, for the markets to anticipate either a return to higher levels of purchases or the ultimate phasing -out of the program. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Are we near that level now?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: That \u2019s an issue for \u2014obviously, there has been improvement , let me say that.  We \u2019ve seen improvement in the last four or five months.  The last five months, for example, we \u2019ve seen over 200,000 jobs a month in the private sector .  Unemployment rate  has come down four -tenths since September.  Unemployment claims, insurance claims are at the lowest level they \u2019ve been since the crisis, so we are seeing improvement.

So , we\u2019ve seen periods before where we had as many as 300,000 jobs for a couple of months, and then things weakened again.

I was wondering, does the Fed have its own estimate of what that subsidy is, and could you tell us what it is, if that\u2019 s the case?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, first, on the reverberations, it \u2019s a difficult situation in Cyprus.  You \u2019ve got a situation where the banking system is a large multiple of  the size of the March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   9 of 26 economy.  And so, in the financial sense, it \u2019s bigger than it is i n a GDP sense.  And it \u2019s a difficult problem because the country faces both fiscal and bank capitalization issues.  And you\u2019ve seen that there \u2019s political stress in terms of trying to figure out how they \u2019re going to meet the demands of the euro group for contributing to their rescue.  So, there are a lot of uncertainties and difficulties , and there \u2019s questions about how \u2014the way Cyprus is treated , what implications that might have for other countries and the like.  So, it does have some consequence .  But , having said that, you know, the vote failed and the markets are up today , and I don \u2019t think that the impact has been enormous.  I mean , I think it \u2019s something we \u2019re paying attention to.  We hope that the Europeans will come up with an efficient and equitable solution.  We are monitoring very carefully, but , at this point, we \u2019re not seeing a major risk to the U .S. financial system or the U.S. economy.   On the benefits of being too big to fail, no, we don \u2019t have an estimate.  It\u2019s pretty difficult to control for all the factors that go into determining the size of the subsidy.  I think there is some evidence that financial markets are, at least to some extent, taking into account the possibility that large financial institution s will fail.  You see, for example, spreads in the credit default swaps that  indicate some probabi lity of failure.  You see some discrimination among different institutions according to the bond market \u2014interest rates that they get charged , and so on.  So there is some evidence of market discrimination.   That being said, I certainly never meant to say to Senator Warren \u2014and I share her concern about too- big-to-fail, I think it \u2019s a major issue \u2014I never meant to imply that the problem was solved and gone.  It is n ot solved and gone ; it\u2019s still here, but there \u2019s a lot of work in train.  We\u2019re putting in the Basel capital standards.  We\u2019 re putting in the orderly liquidation authority from Dodd\u2013Frank .  We \u2019re working with our international partners.  And I hope that  we\u2019ll make March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   10 of 26 progress against too- big-to-fail, because I agree with her 100 percent that it \u2019s a real problem and needs to be addressed if at all possible.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman , I\u2019d like to change the sub ject a little.  Your predecessor served as Fed Chairman for 19 years.  By contrast, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have 8 -year term limits on\u2014for their top people.  I wanted to ask you two questions  related to that.  First, as a matter o f governance, do you think 8 years is the right amount of time for a central bank leader to serve , or should it be less or more , or undefined?  And , more specifically, as it regards to you, your term is 10 years from completion .  How are you thinking about  what you will be doing next year after your term is completed?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, on the latter question, I don \u2019t have anything for you.  I\u2019ll certainly be informing the Wall Street Journal  and other publications if I come to some decision or som e developments in that front.   In terms of term limits, I don \u2019t have a strong view on that.  Different countries use different approaches.  Of course, the P resident always has the option to reappoint or not reappoint Fed Chairm en, and the Senate always ha s the option of confirming or not conf irming.  So, in that respect, term limits are redundant.  And , indeed, if you had term limits on the Fed Chairman , that would be , I think, the only office in the federal government besides P resident and Vice P resident that would have that restriction.   But that being said, again, I don \u2019t view this as a major issue , nor have I seen it actively discussed in, I think, in the Hill .  Perhaps I missed it.  But I don \u2019t have a strong view about that.  My 10- year term , of course , is not as Chairman.  My 10- year remaining term is as a G overnor , so that\u2019s not relevant , really , to the question that you asked about.

You \u2019ve sp oken a lot about the power of forward guidance, the power of clear communication.  I understand that it \u2019s a complicated issue, but why would you leave on the table the additional power of saying to markets, \u201cW e\u2019re going to keep doing this for a while \u201d?  And, separately, there \u2019s been a lot of conversation about the risks associated with quantitative easing.  I wonder if you could tell us , when is the last time you spoke with someone who is unemployed?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Pretty recently .  I have a relative that is unemployed .  But I come from a small town in South Carolina that has taken a big hit from the recession.  Last time I was there, the unemployment rate was about 15 percent.  I think it \u2019s better now.  The home that I was raised in had just been for eclosed upon when I was visiting there.  I have great concern about the unemployed both for their own sake , but also because the loss of skills, the loss of labor force attachment is bad for our whole economy.  It reduces tax revenues .  It reduces producti vity.  So I think it \u2019s very, very important that we act to address unemployment , and I think the Federal Reserve\u2014 I think most people would agree \u2014the Federal Reserve has been fairly active in that regard.    In terms of costs, there are a number of different  costs , and I mentioned some of them in my remarks.  I think one that has recently been discussed\u2014Governor Stein brought it up in a speech \u2014is the issue of financial stability.  Clearly, financial in stability , if it were allowed to be sufficiently serious , would be a threat to employment, a threat to jobs , and a threat to production.  So, obviously, given the experience of the past few years, we want to be sure that we \u2019re not unnecessarily encouraging excessive risk -taking or other problems in the financial  markets.  We do address that through a number of means , including monitoring the financial system, regulation , supervision, communication, and the like .  But this is a potential concern that a March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   12 of 26 number of my colleagues are worried about , and it \u2019s one of the  things we talked about in our discussion of the costs and risks of balance sheet policies. \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Then why would you leave forward guidance on the table?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: I don\u2019 t know what you mean by \u201c on the table.\u201d  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Why not use it as a tool to increase the power of asset purchases?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, again, I don\u2019 t\u2014we \u2019ve not been able to come to an agreement about what guidance we should give .  And part of the concern is \u2014is that as we go forward , we\u2014you know, we \u2019ll have to factor in the efficacy , which is another issue.  I mean, there\u2019 s a wide range of views about how effective asset purchases are in terms of moving the economy.  So , as we move forward in time, we\u2019 ll be learning about how effective the p olicy is , and what cost s and risks  there may be associated with it.  And , as we do that, perhaps we w ill be able to give more -explicit guidance.  And I agree with you 100 percent that that would be more effective if we could give numerical guidance.  But, you know, I think the Federal Reserve has come a long way.  You know, in 1994, we didn\u2019 t even tell people when we changed the federal funds rate.  Now, we \u2019re telling you when\u2014 you know, what the state of the economy is going to be when we raise the federal funds rate.  So, we are making progress in terms of forward guidance.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker .  There have been a number of policies that have been float ed in the last few months regarding of strengthening U .S. banks , one being increased \u2014perhaps making adjustments to the Basel III \u2019s leverage ratio , requiring banks to hold long -term unsecured debt in the  event of a resolution, and then, also , placing a cap on banks\u2019  nondeposit liabilities.  Firstly , is\u2014do you agree with t hese policies and  March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   13 of 26 whether or not the Fed should be pursuing them along with supervisors?  And , secondly, in the context of this question of too- big-to-fail, I mean, do you think these policies would actually help to finally convince the market and the publ ic that too -big-to-fail doesn \u2019t exist?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, I think capital is an important element in addressing too-big-to-fail.  One of the things that will be proposed, and is not in effect yet , will be surcharges on the largest banks \u2014that is , the largest financial institutions will have to hold more capital as a percent of their risk -weighted assets than smaller banks do.  That will increase their cost of funding and, to some extent , will both equalize their cost of funding with other banks and make them safer so that the risk of their failure is limited.  So I think that \u2019s an important step.  And there are many other restrictions in both Dodd\u2013Frank and Basel, including liquidity restrictions and so on, that apply most strictly to the largest institutions.   In terms of the financing, it is true, I think, that excessive reliance on short -term uninsured funding does present some risks.  And there are different ways to address that.  But one way to address it is through liquidity regulation.  And both in our 165\u2013166 rule and now through Basel III, we will be putting forward restrictions on the kinds of financing , the limits on how much illiquidity and liquidity risk firms can take.   Again, I don\u2019 t think too- big-to-fail is solved now.  We \u2019re doing a number of things , which I think will help.  We need to keep assessing that , and we \u2019ll be able to tell by looking at market indicators , by doing our own stress test s and the like.  And if we don\u2019 t, you know, if we don\u2019t achieve the goal, I think we \u2019ll have to do additional steps.  It is important.  I mean, it \u2019s not something we can just forget about.  It may take some time, but too -big-to-fail was a major part of the source of the crisis.  And we will not have successfully responded to the crisis if we don\u2019 t address that problem successfully.

Looking at the level for credit scores  for new home loans rising into the 700s \u2014is that something you would consider to be a successful transm ission of monetary policy , and the \u2014especially given how well the Fed says that banks are capitalized ? \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, the tightening of credit in mortgage markets \u2014I mean, our sense is that it \u2019s gone too far.  I mean, some tightening was obviously needed.  There were people who bought houses prior to the crisis who really couldn\u2019 t sustain a mortgage.  So , terms and conditions have been tightened up, and we \u2019re now seeing much higher credit quality requirements on potential borrowers.  We are concerned that a variety of factors , such as concerns about putbacks the banks may have , uncertainties about regulation \u2014which we \u2019re working on to get done as quickly as possible \u2014may have tightened the mortgage credit box more than would be desirable in a long -run healthy economy.  That does have some effect on monetary policy.  One of the most powerful tools we have is bringing down mortgage rates and stimulating homebuying , construction, and related industries.  So that is an issue that we take into account.  I would say one thing , which is that as the housing industry has strengthened and home prices have gone up, that has actually brought some people into the credit box in the sense that the number of people, for example, who are underwater on their mortgages is declining as house prices go up.  So , as people have bigger down payments, bigger equity in their homes, they become more creditworthy.  So, to some extent, not \u2014I don\u2019 t want to overstate it\u2014but to some extent, monetary  policy \u2014by strengthening the housing market , helping support house prices \u2014is bringing more people into the mortgage market. \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Barnes of Fox Business, sir.  The stock market has been hitting all-time highs.  It\u2019s recovered all of its losses from the financial crisis.  I just want to know if I \u2014March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   15 of 26 from you , if I still have time to get in.   But seriously, how do you feel about that?  Is it good?  Is it bad?  Mission accomplished?  And are you worried about bubbles?  We\u2019re still at 7.7 percent unemployment.  I mean , is the \u2014what do you think?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: That \u2019s right.  We \u2019re not targeting asset prices.  We \u2019re not measuring success in terms of the stock market.  We\u2019re measuring success in terms of our mandate, wh ich is employment and price stability , and that \u2019s what we\u2019 re trying to achieve.  We do monitor the entire financial system, not just the parts that we supervise or regulate.  It includes the stock market and other asset markets.  We use a variety of metrics.  And I don\u2019 t want to , now , be pulled into going through every individual financial market and assessing it.  But, in the stock market, you know, we don\u2019 t see at this point anything that\u2019 s out of line with historical patterns.  In particular, you should remember , of course , that while the Dow may be hitting a high, it\u2019 s in nominal term s, it\u2019s not in real terms.  And if you adjust for inflation and for the growth of the economy, you know, we \u2019re still some distance from the high.  I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s all that surprising that the stock market would rise , given that there has been increased optimism about the economy and the share of income going to profits has been very high.  P rofit increases have been substantial, and the relationship between stock prices and earnings is not particularly unusual at this point. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Marcy Gordon with the Associated Press.  Mr. Chairman, the statement mentions that fiscal policy has become more restrictive.  How much of a drag o n growth do you see from the Social Security tax increase and the across -the-board spending cuts that went into effect on March 1?   And is it possible that the Fed might see a need to provide more support to the economy if that \u2014because of that drag , the drag  on fiscal?    March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   16 of 2\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, our analysis is fairly comparable to analysis that the Congressional Budget Office has presented to the Congress.  And they estimate that putting together all the fiscal measures , including the f iscal c liff deal,  the s equester, and other cuts, that federal f iscal restraint in 2013 is cutting something like 1\u00bd percentage points off of growth, which, of course, is very significant.  So , that is an issue for us.  We \u2014you know, we take as given what the fiscal authorit ies are doing.  The economy is weaker.  Job creation is slower than it would be otherwise.  And so, that is one of the reasons that our policy has been as aggressive as it is.  That being said, as I \u2019ve said many times, monetary policy cannot offset a fisca l restraint of that magnitude , and so the final outcome will be wors e\u2014or, in terms of jobs \u2014than would have been the case with less fiscal restraint.  I want to emphasize that I do believe that long -term fiscal stability is extremely important.  And I urge Congress  and the  Administration , as I always do, when I go to testify to do whatever is necessary to put us on a sustainable fiscal path going forward.  But , in doing so, I think it \u2019s a good idea to pay attention to the impact in the near term on what is s till not a completely satisfactory recovery.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, good afternoon.  You earlier stressed that you want to see improvement in the labor market sustained , and that to make that determination, you have to have adequate economic growt h, and yet the projections in the revised Summary of Economic Projections has kind of a \u2014it seems like an Okun \u2019s law dilemma there.  You \u2014they have reduced the projected rate of unemployment, but , at the same time , lowered the growth forecast.  So how do you square those two?  How do you get sustained improvement in the labor market if the economy is going to slow down?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, if in fact that happens, it \u2019s an issue , obviously.  There\u2019 s been some disconnect , at least in the sh ort run , between unemployment rate changes and March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   17 of 26 growth during this recovery, and there \u2019ve been periods , at least , where unemployment has fallen relatively quickly even though growth has been more limited.  So we \u2019re just going to have to monitor developments  in the economy and see what happens.  You \u2019re right that we \u2019re not forecasting extraordinarily strong growth.  But it is also true , as you \u2014I think, you noted, that our projections for unemployment in the fourth quarter are noticeably lower than they were i n September when we first announced this asset purchase program.  So there has been some improvement in the outlook, as measured by that metric.  But you\u2019 re right.  You know, we do need to see a sustained improvement.  One month, two months doesn\u2019 t cut it.   And , normally, you would expect that you would need to see a reasonable pace of GDP growth in order to achieve that.

First, why didn\u2019 t the Fed publish those results?

And , second, even if you can\u2019 t share how individual banks performed, what did you learn from how \u2014from the results you did see under that adverse scenario?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, the reason for publishing the seve rely adverse scenario, of course, is that \u2019s the ultimate acid test, you know, whether the banks are sufficiently March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   18 of 26 capitalized.  Presumably, if they can survive a severely adverse scenario, then an adverse scenario would\u2014obviously less strenuous, less stress ful, and  they wouldn \u2019t have as much difficulty.  So , I think, in terms of evaluating the health of the banks, the severely adverse scenario is the right one.  That being said, I don\u2019 t see any principl e reason why we couldn\u2019 t provide that information.  I will find out at some point why we are doing it that way.   The severely adverse scenario is mostly just a scaling -up of the adverse scenario, f or the most part .  There are some differences.  For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest  rate risk and interest rate sensitivity  and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long -term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time.  So, again, I think the severely adverse scenario is the one that really puts them to the test.  But we \u2019re always talking about, you know, what information will be useful to investors and to the  press.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Ryan Avent, The Economist .  You\u2019ve noted that most of the C ommittee members don\u2019 t expect an increase in rates until 2015 or 2016, and it looks , in the projections , as though the expectation for the long- run rate of the federal f unds target is around 4 percent , which would be below the sort of peak rate we saw before the recession.  Given the C ommittee \u2019s concerns about unconventional policy, is there any feeling on the C ommittee that perhaps recovery isn \u2019t going fast enough, and that m ore accommodation would be justified?  And has there been any discussion about a change in policy targets to try to stay effective without much of a cushion there between the f ed funds target rate and the zero lower bound?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, as yo u point out, we \u2019re at the zero lower bound, and that makes further accommodation not impossible but more difficult and harder to predict , and March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   19 of 26 with more side effects that are difficult to predict.  I\u2019m not sure I understand the whole thrust of your question.  We have \u2014as you know, we have given this guideline for \u2014so we call them signposts for how the funds rate is going to evolve over time.  And , as a lot of academic research shows, you know, when you\u2019 re close to the zero lower bound, by telling markets that you\u2019re going to keep rates low for a significant period, that \u2019s one way to get longer -term rates down and to provide more stimulus to the economy.  And we think this has been a pretty effective tool.  Now, we could go further.  We could lower even further , say, the unemployment rate number that we hit.  We \u2019ve discussed variants , and at least one member of the C ommittee has suggested that.  But for right now, we find that the thresholds that we have put into that rate guidance seem to be sufficient to approx imate the \u2014what \u2019s called the optimal c ontrol path of i nterest r ates, that it seems to give a path of unemployment and inflation that \u2019s about as good as we can get with the monetary policy tools that we have.  It doesn \u2019t mean we \u2019re satisfied.  It just means that we don\u2019 t have enough fire power to get the economy back to full employment more quickly.  I don \u2019t know if that was responsive or not. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  I guess I\u2019 m not \u2014given the concerns about unconventional policy relative to normal interest rate policy, is there a feeling that more should be done so that when  the next potential recession rolls around, we have more room to cut rates, or are you comfortable just using th ese threshold policies on an ongoing basis?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  I see.  So you\u2019 re talking about the inflation target, basically.  Is that fair?  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Ye s, I think so. \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Ye s, okay.  So , historically, the argument for having inflation greater than zero \u2014we define price stability as 2 percent inflation , as do most central March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   20 of 26 banks around the world.  And one might ask, \u201cWell, price stability should be zero inflation.  Why do you choose 2 percent instead of zero? \u201d  And the answer  is, the question you\u2019 re raising , which is that if you have zero inflation, you\u2019 re very close to the deflation zone , and nominal interest rates will be so low that it would be very difficult to respond fully to recessions.  And so, historical experience has  suggested that 2 percent is an appropriate balance between the cost of inflation and the cost that you\u2019 re referring to.  We haven \u2019t contemplated changing that.  We just put that number in, as you know, fairly recently.  I think at this point, it \u2019s still b eing debated in academic circles that \u2014you know, and we \u2019ll see what kind of outcome they come up with.  But it\u2019s an interesting question to try to quantify.  There is research, for example, which asks the question, how often do you tend to hit the zero lowe r bound?  And our belief a few years ago was that it was a very rare event , and now it \u2019s become more common.  So I \u2019m sure there\u2019 ll be a lot of thinking about this in academic and other circles. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Ben Weyl, Congressional Quarte rly.  There\u2019 s a lot of talk about whether certain institutions are too big to fail.  And I wanted to get at a different, if related, question.  In 1980, let \u2019s say , there was about \u2014the financial sector comprised about 5 percent of the U .S. economy, U .S. GDP ; now it \u2019s about 9 percent.  And I \u2019m wondering if you think that shift is beneficial to the U .S. economy?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  I don\u2019 t think I know the answer to that question.  Certainly, the financial system has \u2014I could argue two ways.  I could say, wel l, the U .S. economy grew pretty well between 1945 and 1975 or 1980.  And the financial system was much simpler and didn\u2019 t have a lot of exotic derivatives and so on.  So that would be \u2014that would be one way to argue that maybe, you know, all of this  extra financial activity is not justified.  On the other hand, the world is a lot more complicated.  We \u2019re a lot \u2014the world is a lot more international.  March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   21 of 26 You have large multinational firms that are connecting resources, savers , and investors in different co untries.  There \u2019s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services , and so on.  So, I think, based on that and based on the innovations that information technology have created in lots of industries, you would expect financial services to be some what bigger.  So I don\u2019 t really know the answer to that question.  I think that my predecessor Paul Volcker \u2019s claim that the only contribution to the financial industry is the a utomatic t eller m achine might be a little exaggerated.  I know that people \u2014some  people have that view.  Again, I don\u2019 t know the answer.  I think that a somewhat bigger financial sector can be justified by the wider range of services and the more globalized financial economic system that we have.  But the exact number, I can \u2019t really say.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, I \u2019m Jeremy Tordjman with the AFP Newswire Agency.  I have a follow -up question on Cyprus.  As a central banker, do you think it was either appropriate or fair to impose a levy on every bank deposit in Cyprus , even those  insured by the European Union itself?  Thank you. \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, I have not been involved in those conversations and I don\u2019t necessarily know all the details , and so I know they \u2019re grappling with a very difficult problem.  I think the issue they face is that there\u2019 s a pretty big hole, a financial hole, in the sense that there is a fiscal issue and there \u2019s also a bank restructuring recapitalization issue.  So , they \u2019re looking for resources where they can find them.  I think everyone understands that there are certain risks with that besides the equity issue of taxing lower -income people.  There is the issue of setting a pre cedent that might reduce confidence in banks in subsequent periods.  But again, that being said, it \u2019s a very tough issue.  An d I\u2014and finding the resources to solve Cyprus \u2019s March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   22 of 26 problem, you know, there \u2019s probably no easy way to do it.  And we \u2019re going to keep monitoring that.  But I don\u2019 t envy them that particular challenge.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  There\u2019 s been a trend in the last couple of years where the economy kind of jumped out of the gate in the first part of the year only to kind of falter.  Is that something that you\u2019 re worried about this year?  And does that suggest that QE might have to stay kind of at the same pace you are now and some into the third quarter until we \u2019re sure about that\u2014that trend?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, you\u2019 re absolutely right that there \u2019s been a certain tendency for a spring slump that we \u2019ve seen a few times.  One possible explanation for that \u2014besides some freaky things, some weather events and so on, one possible explanation is seasonality.  Because of the severity of the recession in 2007 to 2009, the seasonals got distorted.  And they may have led \u2014and I say \u201c may\u201d because the statistical experts \u2014many of them deny it, but it\u2019 s possible that they led job creation and GDP to be exaggerated to some extent early in the year.  Our assessment is, though, that at this point, that we \u2019re far enough away from the recession that those seasonal factors ought to be pretty much washing out by now.  So if we do , in fact , see a slump, it would probably be due to real fundamental causes  and then we would obviously have to respond to that.  As I said , we\u2019re planning to adjust our tools to respond to changes in the outlook, a nd that can go either direction. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Donald Judd, CBS News.  I was wondering if you could tell me how , if a run on the banks happens in Cyprus, how that might affect U .S. markets.  And also, is it possible for the U .S. to levy a tax on regular deposits here , or why not?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, as someone mentioned, Cyprus is a tiny economy , and I don\u2019 t think that these issues , as worrisome as they are and as concerned as we would be for March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   23 of 26 the Cypriote people , I don\u2019 t think that they have direct implications for the U .S. economy.  The only way that they would create a problem would be if the runs became contagious in some sense, if depositors in other countries lost confidence.  But at this point, I \u2019m not awar e of any evidence that that is , in fact , the case.  The argument the Europeans are making is that Cyprus is a very unique situation, very different situation.  And, indeed, it is quite unusual to have a banking sector as large as they have relative to thei r economy.  In terms of the United States, you know, the FDIC was founded, I think, in 1934, a nd insured deposits , and they\u2019re very proud of the fact that no one \u2019s ever lost a dime in insured deposits.  And , during the crisis, the response of the government was , in fact , to increase the level of, you know, depositor account sizes that were insured.  So I consider that to be extremely unlikely in the United States.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Don Lee at the L .A. Times .  Would you be in favor of reducing the flow of stimulus if we had another month or two, as we did in February , of job growth and the unemployment rate dropping, but the long -term unemployed didn\u2019 t change much?  And , on a related question, how much of a pickup do you expect to see in the labor force participation rate, and what will we need to see there for that to show substantial improvement?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  On the first question, as I said, I mean that \u2019s a decision for the C ommittee.  We \u2019re going to have to make a judgment about how significant the improvement is, how sustained it is.  Long -term unemployment is one dimension of the unemployment problem.  But I think that probably the best way to get the long -term unemployed back to work is to get an overall strong labor market.  And I think that \u2019s\u2014we \u2019d be looking at the overall key indicators like overall unemployment rate, payrolls and hiring, and some of the other things that I mentioned.  The other part of your question was about \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Labor force.  March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   24 of 2\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Labor force participation, yes .  Labor force participation has been declining on a trend- like basis in the United States for a while.  That \u2019s the result , mostly , of demographic factors , partly the aging of the population, partly the fact that female participation is no longer increasing \u2014it\u2019 s in fact decreasing a little bit.  It\u2019s also the case that labor force attachment within people of working age has declined for a number of different reasons.  So there \u2019s a trend underlying this.  And , in addition, there are probably some people who\u2019ve left the labor force just because they are discouraged and they can \u2019t find work.  So , as the economy strengthens, the labor market strengthens, I would expect to see some of these folks coming back into the labor force.  For example, the number of people who are out of the labor force but say they would like a full -time job but are  not actually counted as unemployed, that number has actually been going up, w hich suggest s that there are more people thinking about going back into the labor force, going back to work.  But I doubt that , in the near term at least , that we \u2019ll see an increase in labor force participation because\u2014 besides the effects of the slow recovery, high unemployment , we\u2019ve had  a downward trend in the U .S., which is not due to the recession , it\u2019s due to underlying demographic factors. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Catherine Hollander from National Journal .  You argued in a 1999 paper and a 2002 speech that monetary policy was not the right tool for addressing asset bubbles.  But in January, you suggested that there might be a role for it , even if not as the first line of defense.  Has your thinking on the issue evolved, and can you explain why?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, I still believe the following , which is that monetary policy is a very blunt instrument.  If you are raising interest rates to pop an asset bubble, even if you were sure you can do that, you might , at the same time , be throwing the  economy into recession , which kind of defeats the purpose of monetary policy.  And therefore, I think the first March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL   25 of 26 line of defense \u2014I mean, I think, we have a sort of a tripartite line of defense.  We start off with very extensive and sophisticated monitoring  at a much higher level and much more comprehensively than we \u2019ve had in the past.  Then we have supervision and regulation, where we work with other agencies to try to cover all the empty or uncovered areas in the financial system.  And then, in addition, we try to use communication and similar tools to a ffect the way that financial markets respond to monetary policy.  So we do have some first lines of defense , which I think should be used first.  That being said, you know, I think that given the problems that we\u2019 ve had \u2014not just in the United States, but globally in the last 15, 20 years \u2014that we need to at least take into account these issues as we make monetary policy.  And I think most of the people on the FOMC would agree with that.  What that means exact ly depends on the circumstances.  I think if the economy is in very weak condition and interest rates are very low for that purpose, it \u2019s very difficult to contemplate raising rates a lot because you \u2019re concerned about some sector in the financial sphere.  On the other hand, if you\u2019 re in an expansion and there\u2019 s a credit boom going on, that \u2014the case in that situation for making policy a little bit tighter might be better.  So , as I \u2019ve said many times, I have an open mind in this question.  We \u2019re learning ; all central bankers are learning.  But I think I still would agree with the point I made in my very first speech in 2002, as a Governor at the Federal Reserve , where I argued that the first line of defense ought to be the more targeted tools that we have , including regulatory tools and, to some extent , macroprudential tools like some emerging markets use.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I\u2019ve spoken to the President a bit, but I really don\u2019 t have any\u2014I don\u2019 t really have any information for you at this juncture.  I don\u2019 t think that I \u2019m the only person in the world who can manage the exit.  In fact, one of the things that I hope to accomplish , and was not entirely successful at , as the Governor or as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, was to try to depersonalize, to some extent, monet ary policy and financial policy and to get broader recognition of the fact that this is an extraordinary institution.  It has a large number of very high quality policymakers.  It has a terrific staff \u2014literally dozens of Ph.D. economists who\u2019ve been working through the crisis , trying to understand these issues and implement our policy tools, and there \u2019s no single person who is essential to that.  But , again, with respect to my personal plans, I will certainly let you know when I have something more concrete.   Thank you.  \n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 5, "dovish": 15, "neutral": 29}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 0, "dovish": 2, "neutral": 26}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 5, "dovish": 17, "neutral": 55}, "speech_summary": "The Federal Open Market Committee concluded their meeting and discussed recent economic developments, noting that the recovery is expected to resume with continued growth in spending and improvements in the job market. However, the committee remains concerned about restrictive fiscal policies and inflation running below their target.The FOMC notes that longer-term inflation expectations remain stable. They emphasize the need for policies that support progress towards maximum employment in the context of price stability, given the still-high unemployment and relatively low inflation.Most participants agreed that the Federal Reserve's asset purchases continue to support economic growth and job creation by lowering interest rates, but they also acknowledged that this tool alone may not be enough to counter major economic challenges. The Committee discussed the potential risks and costs of expanding the balance sheet, including adverse effects on securities markets and the Federal Reserve's earnings, but concluded that these costs are manageable and will be monitored as they determine the size and pace of asset purchases.The FOMC has decided to keep the federal funds rate at its current low level and expects to maintain this accommodative stance for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends. The Committee will assess economic conditions and determine whether it is appropriate to raise the target for the federal funds rate, with the goal of supporting the recovery and ensuring price stability.The FOMC expects a considerable amount of time to pass between ending asset purchases and raising the federal funds rate. They will take a balanced approach to policy, focusing on maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. The Committee anticipates moderate economic growth, with signs of improvement in the labor market but elevated unemployment. Inflation is expected to remain low, and fiscal policy has become more restrictive. The Committee reaffirmed its asset purchase program and federal funds guidance based on their outlook and a review of the efficacy and costs.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Can you give us any additional color on what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for specifically in terms of substantial improvement in the labor market? And does the fact that there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thresholds associated with QE say anything about the level of disagreement among the Committee members over what that exit should look like?\n'ANSWER': The lack of thresholds for QE comes from the complexity of the problem and the different views on the potential effects on financial stability. We will continue to provide information as we make progress towards our objective and may adjust the flow rate of purchases month to month. We will be looking for sustained improvement in a range of labor market indicators and overall economic growth.", "'QUESTION': What are the conditions that would induce the FOMC to vary the rate of purchases, as opposed to stopping the program altogether?\n'ANSWER': Having a single criterion for stopping the program would be difficult for the markets to understand. The FOMC believes it makes more sense to adjust the rate of flow of purchases in a continuous or sensitive way to changes in the outlook. They may adjust the pace of purchases when the situation has changed in a meaningful way to keep the level of accommodation consistent with the outlook and provide the markets with a sense of progress.", "'QUESTION': Could you define \"progress towards\" and how you deal with it?\n'ANSWER': \"Progress towards\" refers to broad-based improvement in various indicators, output, and labor demand. If there are partial or modest improvements in the labor market, we may reduce accommodation. However, if the labor market weakens or the outlook worsens, we can bring back accommodation to previous levels.", "'QUESTION': Are we near the time to adjust the flow rate and how can the markets calibrate the number to changes in economic improvement?\n'ANSWER': The decision to adjust the flow rate is made by the Committee based on progress and outlook. Internal models and indicators are used to estimate the necessary change. The purpose is to let the market see the Fed's behavior and anticipate future changes in the program.", "'QUESTION': Does the fact that Cyprus can cause global reverberations suggest that the financial system is more fragile than the Fed stress tests suggest? Does the Fed have its own estimate of the \"too big to fail\" subsidy?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke acknowledges the potential risks posed by Cyprus and emphasizes the need to assess the fragility of the financial system. He does not provide a direct answer to the question about the Fed's estimate of the \"too big to fail\" subsidy.", "QUESTION: Doesn't the fact that a small country like Cyprus can cause global reverberations suggest that the financial system is more fragile than the Fed stress tests suggest? And does the Fed have its own estimate of the \"too big to fail\" subsidy?\nANSWER: The situation in Cyprus is difficult due to the size of its banking system compared to its economy. While there are uncertainties and difficulties, the impact on the US financial system and economy is not major. The Fed does not have an estimate of the \"too big to fail\" subsidy, but there is evidence of market discrimination indicating some probability of failure for large financial institutions. The Fed acknowledges that the problem of \"too big to fail\" still exists and is being addressed.", "'QUESTION': Do you think 8 years is the right amount of time for a central bank leader to serve, or should it be less or more, or undefined? And, more specifically, as it regards to you, your term is 10 years from completion. How are you thinking about what you will be doing next year after your term is completed?\n'ANSWER': I don't have a strong view on term limits for central bank leaders. Different countries use different approaches and the President and Senate have the power to reappoint or not. Term limits on the Fed Chairman would be unique and I don't view it as a major issue. My remaining 10-year term is as a Governor, not Chairman.", "'QUESTION': Why would you leave on the table the additional power of saying to markets, \"We're going to keep doing this for a while\"? When is the last time you spoke with someone who is unemployed?\n'ANSWER': I have great concern about the unemployed both for their own sake, but also because it is bad for our whole economy. In terms of costs, financial instability is a potential concern that my colleagues are worried about, and it's one of the things we talked about in our discussion of the costs and risks of balance sheet policies.", "'QUESTION': Then why would you leave forward guidance on the table?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke expresses confusion about the phrase \"on the table\" and does not understand the reporter's question regarding leaving forward guidance.", "QUESTION: Why not use asset purchases as a tool to increase power?\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve has not reached an agreement on the guidance to give regarding asset purchases. There are differing views on the effectiveness of asset purchases in stimulating the economy. As we learn more about the policy's effectiveness, we may be able to provide more explicit guidance. The Federal Reserve has made progress in forward guidance compared to the past.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree with the policies aimed at strengthening US banks and do you think they will convince the market and the public that too-big-to-fail doesn't exist?\n'ANSWER': Capital is important in addressing too-big-to-fail, and proposed surcharges on the largest banks will increase their cost of funding and make them safer. Liquidity regulation and restrictions on financing will also be implemented. Too-big-to-fail is not solved yet, but steps are being taken to address the problem.", "'QUESTION': Is the tightening of credit in mortgage markets a successful transmission of monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': The tightening of credit in mortgage markets has gone too far, with higher credit quality requirements on potential borrowers. This tightening may have been excessive due to concerns about putbacks, uncertainties about regulation, and the desire to stimulate homebuying and related industries. Monetary policy has helped strengthen the housing market and bring more people into the mortgage market.", "'QUESTION': How does the Chairman feel about the stock market hitting all-time highs and is he worried about bubbles?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman states that they are not targeting asset prices and their success is measured in terms of employment and price stability. They monitor the entire financial system, including the stock market, but currently do not see anything out of line with historical patterns. The stock market rise is not surprising given increased optimism about the economy and high profits.", "'QUESTION': How much of a drag on growth do you see from the Social Security tax increase and the across-the-board spending cuts?\n'ANSWER': The Congressional Budget Office estimates that all the fiscal measures, including the fiscal cliff deal and the sequester, are cutting around 1.5 percentage points off of growth in 2013. This fiscal restraint is significant and has led to weaker job creation. Monetary policy cannot fully offset this magnitude of fiscal restraint.", "'QUESTION': How do you reconcile the reduced projected rate of unemployment with the lowered growth forecast in terms of sustaining improvement in the labor market?\n'ANSWER': There has been a disconnect between unemployment rate changes and growth during this recovery. We need to monitor developments in the economy and see what happens. While our projections for unemployment have improved, sustained improvement requires reasonable GDP growth. We will continue to support the economy and observe how things evolve.", "'QUESTION': Why didn't the Fed publish the results of the stress test under the merely adverse scenario and what did they learn from the results they did see under the adverse scenario?\n'ANSWER': The Fed did not publish the results of the stress test under the merely adverse scenario because it featured an inflation shock followed by a quick rise in short-term rates. They did not share how individual banks performed, but they learned valuable insights from the results they did see under the adverse scenario.", "'QUESTION': Why didn't the Fed publish the results of the severely adverse scenario and what did they learn from the results they did see?\n'ANSWER': The severely adverse scenario is the ultimate test of bank capitalization, and if banks can survive that scenario, they would have less difficulty with an adverse scenario. There is no principle reason why the Fed couldn't provide that information, and the severely adverse scenario is mostly a scaling-up of the adverse scenario. Higher interest rates can actually increase banks' franchise value. The Fed is considering what information would be useful to investors and the press.", "'QUESTION': Is there any feeling on the Committee that perhaps recovery isn't going fast enough, and that more accommodation would be justified? And has there been any discussion about a change in policy targets to try to stay effective without much of a cushion there between the fed funds target rate and the zero lower bound?\n'ANSWER': We are at the zero lower bound, which makes further accommodation more difficult and harder to predict with more side effects. We have given guidelines for how the funds rate will evolve over time, and telling markets that we will keep rates low for a significant period is one way to stimulate the economy. We could go further and lower the unemployment rate threshold, but for now, the thresholds we have seem to be sufficient. We don't have enough firepower to get the economy back to full employment quickly.", "'QUESTION': Is there a need to do more to have more room to cut rates during the next recession or is using threshold policies sufficient?\n'ANSWER': The reporter is asking if there should be additional measures to have more flexibility in cutting rates during a future recession, or if relying on threshold policies is enough. Chairman Bernanke clarifies that the question is essentially about the inflation target.", "'QUESTION': Why is the target for price stability set at 2 percent inflation instead of zero?\n'ANSWER': Having zero inflation would bring the risk of deflation, making it difficult to respond to recessions with low nominal interest rates. Historical experience suggests that 2 percent is a balance between the costs of inflation and the costs of being close to deflation. The target has been recently debated in academic circles.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the shift in the financial sector comprising a larger percentage of the US economy is beneficial?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke is unsure of the answer. He acknowledges that the financial system was simpler in the past and grew well, suggesting that the extra financial activity may not be justified. However, he also recognizes that the world is more complex and interconnected now, with increased demand for risk sharing and liquidity services. He believes a somewhat larger financial sector can be justified, but cannot provide an exact number.", "'QUESTION': Do you think it was appropriate or fair to impose a levy on every bank deposit in Cyprus, even those insured by the European Union?\n'ANSWER': I have not been involved in those conversations and don't know all the details. They are facing a difficult problem with a financial hole and are looking for resources. There are risks involved, such as taxing lower-income people and reducing confidence in banks. It's a tough issue and there's probably no easy way to solve it.", "'QUESTION': Is the trend of a spring slump in the economy a concern this year and does it suggest that QE might need to continue at the same pace until the third quarter?\n'ANSWER': There has been a tendency for a spring slump in the economy in recent years, possibly due to distorted seasonals from the severity of the recession. However, we believe that those seasonal factors should be washing out by now. If there is a slump, it would likely be due to real fundamental causes and we would respond accordingly.", "'QUESTION': How might a run on the banks in Cyprus affect U.S. markets? Can the U.S. levy a tax on regular deposits?\n'ANSWER': The issues in Cyprus are not likely to directly impact the U.S. economy, unless the runs on banks become contagious in other countries. The U.S. has measures in place, such as the FDIC, to insure deposits and has never allowed insured deposits to be lost. It is highly unlikely for the U.S. to levy a tax on regular deposits.", "'QUESTION': Would the FOMC consider reducing stimulus if there is sustained job growth and a drop in the unemployment rate, but no change in long-term unemployment?\n'ANSWER': The decision to reduce stimulus is up to the Committee, who will assess the significance and sustainability of the improvement. While long-term unemployment is a concern, a strong overall labor market is the best way to address it. Key indicators like overall unemployment rate, payrolls, and hiring will be considered.", "'QUESTION': What are the reasons for the decline in labor force participation in the United States?\n'ANSWER': Labor force participation has been declining due to demographic factors such as the aging population and decreasing female participation. Additionally, labor force attachment within working-age individuals has also declined. Some people have left the labor force out of discouragement and inability to find work. However, as the economy strengthens, it is expected that some of these individuals will return to the labor force.", "QUESTION: Has your thinking on the role of monetary policy in addressing asset bubbles evolved over time?\nANSWER: Monetary policy is a blunt instrument and raising interest rates to address asset bubbles can potentially throw the economy into recession. The first line of defense should be extensive monitoring, supervision and regulation, and using communication and similar tools to affect financial markets. However, the circumstances and the state of the economy should be taken into account when making monetary policy decisions.", "'QUESTION': To what extent does Chairman Bernanke feel personally responsible for the decisions regarding the exit strategy and how does that affect his future? Has he had a conversation with the President about his future?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke does not feel that he is the only person who can manage the exit strategy. He hopes to depersonalize monetary and financial policy and emphasize the institution's quality policymakers and staff. He has spoken to the President but does not have any information to share about his future plans at this time."]}
