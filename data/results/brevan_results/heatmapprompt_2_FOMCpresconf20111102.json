Fed\u2019s policy.  You received a letter on the eve of the September meeting urging you not to take action from th e GOP leadership.  Se veral GOP presidential candidates have criticized Fed policy in the debates.   On the first issue, do you feel that crossed the line?  Was it appropriate in terms of the concepts of the Fed\u2019s independence?  On the second question, what are the GOP presidential candi dates not hearing or understanding about Fed policy, in your opinion?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, politics is politics, and the Federal Reserve tries to stay nonpartisan and out of those debates.  I mea n, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S. economy, to do what we can to promote our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and although we must be accountable to the Congress over the longe r term, in the short term, it\u2019s very important that the Fed be free fr om political pressures.  And therefore, we are going to make our decisions based on what\u2019s go od for the economy, and we\u2019re not going to take any politics into account.   November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 6 of 22  Now, the concerns that have been expressed re late to the possibility that the Fed\u2019s highly expansionary policies might be cont ributing to inflation risk.  I woul d simply point to the record.  If you look back for the last five years, in flation\u2014although it\u2019s been  volatile be cause of commodity price fluctuations\u2014has averaged about 2 percent, which is close to a reasonable definition of price stability, whereas the area wh ere we have fallen shor t, obviously, is on the unemployment side.  So I think that criticisms ba sed on the concern about inflation have so far, at least, not proved to  be very valid. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Was th e letter appropriate\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, I\u2019m not going to comment on that.  I\u2014we listen to everybody\u2019s input, and the most important thing is that we are free to make the decision based on the interest of the American peopl e, what\u2019s in the interest of the economy, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Has the Fed discusse d the idea of nominal GDP targeting?  And what are your views on the advantages a nd disadvantages of that approach?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: So the Fed\u2019s mandate is, of course, a dual mandate.  We have a mandate for both employment and for pric e stability, and we have  a framework in place that allows us to communicate and to think a bout the two sides of that  mandate.  We talked today\u2014or yesterday, actually\u2014about nominal GDP as  an indicator, as an information variable, as something to add to the list of variables that  we think about, and it was a very interesting discussion.  However, we think th at within the existing framework that we have, which looks at both sides of the mandate, not just some combin ation of the two, we can communicate whatever we need to communicate about future monetary policy.  So we are not contemplating at this November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 7 of 22  date\u2014at this time\u2014any radical change in fram ework.  We are going to stay within the dual-mandate approach that we\u2019ve b een using until this point. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chairman, you\u2019ve said in the past you understand some of the anger on display with the Occupy Wall Street proteste rs.  And a lot of the anger is directed at the Fed, with some protesters saying that the Fed is part of the problem, that the Fed preserves the financial system and promotes income inequality.  Can\u2014are the protesters right?  Is the Fed part of the problem?  And, secondarily, can the Fe d do anything to promote a more equitable economy?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, as I\u2019ve said  before, I certainly understand that many people are dissatisfied with the state of the econo my.  I\u2019m dissatisfied with the state of the economy.  Unemployment is far to o high.  Inequality, which is not a new phenomenon, has been going on\u2014increases in inequality have been going on for at least 30 years, but obviously as that has continued, we now have a more unequal society than we\u2019ve had in the past.  So again, I fully sympathize with the notion that the economy is not performing the way we would like it to be, and in that respect, the concerns that people express across the spectru m are understandable.   I think that the concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions.  The Federal Reserve was involved, obviously, in trying to stabilize the fina ncial system in 2008 and 2009.  A very simplistic interpreta tion of that was that we were doing th at because we wanted to preserve, you know, bankers\u2019 salaries.  That is obviously not the case.  What  we were doing is trying to protect the financial system in order to prevent a serious collap se of both the financial system and the American economy.  We needed to take  those steps.  If we hadn\u2019t taken them, the consequences would have been dire.  And not  everybody understands that, and therefore they sometimes misunderstand our motives.  Our motives ar e strictly to do what\u2019s in the interest of November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 8 of 22  the broad public, and I believe that our efforts to  stabilize the financial system, which ultimately proved successful, were very much in the interest of th e broad public.   With respect to the current economy, as I de scribed earlier, we are currently continuing with our accommodative monetary policy.  We are trying to do our be st to support economic growth and job creation.  I think it would be help ful if we could get assistance from some other parts of the government to work with us, to he lp create more jobs.  But certainly, we are doing our part to try to create more jobs  and more opportunities in America.   With respect to inequality, I think the best way to address inequality is to create jobs.  It gives people opportunities.  It gives people a chance to earn in come, gain experience, and to ultimately earn more.  But that\u2019s an indirect a pproach; that\u2019s really the only way the Fed can address inequality per se. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman, the Fed\u2019s forecast for 2013 shows the unemploymen t rate finishing the year between 7.8 and 8.2 percent.  The statement says th at short-term rates will stay near  their current levels at least through mid-2013.  Does that suggest that the Fed c ould conceive of raising short-term interest rates before unemployment even ge ts to 8 percent or much lower?  And if not, could you explain how people should interpret those two messages?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, the statement says \u201cat least\u201d mid-2013.  So, clearly, it could well be some point beyond that, and market s are currently anticipa ting a somewhat later liftoff.  One of the things we discussed yesterday in our comm unications discussion was how we might further clarify that part of the statement and try to provide more information about what conditions would prevail at the tim e that we would be considering raising rates.  But we haven\u2019t come to that point yet, but we certainly would li ke to provide more clarity about that.  But again, November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 9 of 22  let me emphasize that what we are saying now is \u201cat least\u201d; ther e\u2019s no implication that we would necessarily move in mid-2013 with those conditions prevai ling that you described. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Pedro DaCost a from Reuters.  Mr. Chairm an, what is your appetite for a renewed push into large-scale mortgage-bac ked securities purchases?  The Fed had stated the intention to move the struct ure of its balance sheet more to  its original, you know, Treasuries-only composition.  But recently, it revived the MBS program through the reinvestments, and folks like Governor Tarullo and William Dudley have raised the possibility of further large-scale asset purchases on the MBS side.  Could you comment on your views on that particular proposal?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Yes, I\u2019ll be glad to.  You were absolutely correct\u2014first, that ultimately we would like to return our portfol io to Treasuries only.  That may be some time down the road at this point.  Y ou\u2019re also correct that as part of our policy action at the last meeting, we began to reinvest mortgage-backed  securities and agency  debt back into  mortgage-backed securities, thereby providing some  additional support for the mortgage market.  The housing sector is a very importa nt sector.  It\u2019s\u2014the problems in  that sector are clearly a big reason why our economy is not recovering more quickly.  So I do thi nk that purchases of mortgage-backed securities is a viable option.  It \u2019s certainly something we would consider if conditions were appropriate.  So the answer is yes, we w ould certainly look at that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com.  At the moment now, banks are holding hundr eds of billions of dollars in excess reserves, and at the same time, corporations seem to be holding lo ts of cash on the\u2014and foreigners\u2014at the same time, foreigners keep investing a lot of money in the United Stat es.  The current account deficit November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 10 of 22  is very large.  Could you shed some light on that situation?  Is there something that foreigners know that U.S. companies don\u2019t abou t investing in the U.S.?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, most of the\u2014 a great deal of the investment in the U.S. takes the form of purchases of U.S. governme nt debt in Treasury secu rities.  And that, in turn, reflects the desire for the liquidity and safe ty provided by the U.S. Treasury market.  For example, as you know, two of the largest holders  of U.S. Treasury securities are China and Japan, who hold those securities primarily as fore ign exchange reserves and, in the case of China, in an effort to keep their exchange ra te from appreciating too quickly.  So, I was\u2014while it\u2019s good that foreign central banks and so on have the confidence to buy U.S. Treasuries, it\u2019s not quite the same as investing in pl ant and equipment.  We\u2019ve seen a little bit of improvement there, but it\u2019s still obviously  too low to be consistent w ith a full employment economy. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Peter Barnes, Fox Business.  Sir, could you comment on the failure of MF Global, which is a primary dealer?  And specifically, the Financial Times  is reporting that the leverage ratio at MF Global was 40 to 1.  Were you aware of that?  Did the Fed approve of that?  Is that an acceptable leverage ratio, pa rticularly since the fi nancial crisis?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Certainly.  The New York Federal Reserve Bank approved MF Global to be a primary dealer; I believe it was in February of this year.  At that time, the company met the criteria that had been set fo rth in terms of management, financial condition, capacity, and so on to qualify to be a primary deal er.  We have set those standards in a way that would allow smaller firms like MF Global to part icipate in the primary dealer market.  But I would like to emphasize, I guess, a couple of point s.  First, we are not the regulators of MF Global.  That\u2019s done by the SEC and the CFTC , so we do not have ongoing insight into developments within the company.  And secondl y, again, making them a primary dealer did not November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 11 of 22  in any way constitute a seal of approval.  In  fact, the New York Fed\u2019s website contains a statement pretty much to that effect.  So, they  were a primary dealer, we stopped trading with them before they failed, and we\u2019ve suffered no losses or other consequences from our transactions with the company.  Again, in terms of your questi on about leverage and financial condition, the company declined very, very quick ly based on, apparently, a small number of large bets.  As far as I know we were not awar e of that, but again, to emphasize, we were not\u2014we are not the overseers, the re gulators of that company. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Can I just as k whether you see it as an is olated case or whether this is the start of some thing broader?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: The question is, Was that  an isolated case?   It appears to be an idiosyncratic case, and we\u2019re monitori ng the possible impacts on funding markets and elsewhere.  And, so far, we\u2019ve not seen any significant impact on fi nancial stability. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: To follow up on that question, should the Fed be, on an ongoing basis, monitoring its primary dealers?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: The question is, Sh ould the Fed be monitoring its primary dealers?  Only if the Fed is the supervis or.  In this case, the combination of a  broker\u2013dealer and a futures commission merchant  imply that the SEC and the CFTC are the appropriate supervisors.  They would not have qualified\u2014this company would not have qualified as a SIFI under the provisional guidance issued by the FSOC, so there\u2019s no basis at this point for the Fed to be the overseer of that, of those companies. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Neil Irwin with the Washington Post .  Mr. Chairman, this is the third straight set of economic projecti ons you\u2019ve released that have downgraded forecasts for growth and for employment.  I wonder, is there some sy stematic error, some blind spot that\u2019s behind November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 12 of 22  these, kind of, overly optimistic forecasts?  Wh at are you doing internally to understand what you got wrong the last few projections?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, it\u2019s a pe rfectly fair question.  And, you know, we spend a lot of time reviewing those errors.  The staff, in particular , presents us with information on forecast errors and on revisions, et cetera, and so we look at th at very carefully.  I think it\u2019s clear that\u2014in retrospect, that the severity of th e financial crisis and a number of other problems, including the dysfunction of  the housing market, have been more severe and more persistent than we initially believed, and that, together with a number of other phenomena like deleveraging by the household sector and so on, has slowed the pace of recovery.  So, yes, we have again downgraded the medium-term forecast.  Evid ently, the forces\u2014you know, the drags on the recovery were stronger than we thought.   I would add, however, though, that although I th ink it\u2019s very importa nt to look at the fundamental factors affecting th e recovery, there\u2019ve been some elements of bad luck.  For example, this year, the combination of the natu ral disaster in Japan wh ich had global impacts in terms of growth, oil price increases , the European debt crisis, whic h was not anticipated to be as severe and create as much volatility as it has in  financial markets\u2014all those things have been negatives for growth, and they do explain at  least part of the downward revision. \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee with Bloomberg Television.  Many Americans wonder what the Fed has actually accomplished w ith its monetary policy actions since about QE2.  Fed officials like to talk  about the effect they\u2019ve had on  interest rates, but the economy seems insensitive to interest rates these days .  Can you explain what you have managed to accomplish?  Can you tell us whether you feel your mandate requires you to do anything you can think of on an ongoing basis until some targets ar e met?  And can you ex plain to the average November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 13 of 22  American why you\u2019re doing what yo u\u2019re doing?  And do you think that  you risk credibility if the average American doesn\u2019t s ee some sort of improvement in the economy?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: No, it\u2019s a fair quest ion.  I would first say that monetary policy is having effects on the economy.  And we\u2019v e talked about the effects on asset prices, but we have continued to analyze the effects of chan ges in interest rates, for example, on decisions like investment or car purchases.  One area wher e monetary policy has been blunted\u2014the effects have been blunted\u2014has been the mortgage mark et, where very tight credit standards have prevented many people from purchasing or refi nancing their homes, and therefore the low mortgage rates that we\u2019ve achieved have not been  as effective as we had hoped.  So, monetary policy may be somewhat less powerful in the curren t context than it has been in the past, but nevertheless, it is affecting econom ic growth and job creation.   If you ask about the accomplishments, I would first of all mention a very important one, which is that we have kept inflation close to 2 percent, on average, which both has avoided the problems of high inflation but al so very importantly has avoide d the risk of deflation.  And we\u2019ve seen in other countries, in other contexts, that deflation can be a very pernicious problem and very difficult to get out of once you are there.  So we have been able to achieve, on average, stable prices.   With respect to growth, I think that our polic ies, including the cutti ng of rates to zero in December 2008 and the first round of asset purchases  in the fall of \u201908 and in the spring of \u201909, were very important for helpi ng to explain why the economy st opped contracting and began to grow again in the middle of 2009.  I think there\u2019s a lot of evidence that that did promote growth and job creation.  I would argue th at we\u2019ve also been successful w ith some of the later actions that we\u2019ve taken, although it\u2019s early to say for things like the maturity extension program, but we November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 14 of 22  always face the problem of asking the question, Well,  where would we be without these policies?  And our best estimates are that\u2014absent the supp ort of monetary policy, that the economy would be in a much deeper ditch and that unemployment would be much higher th an it is.  That being said, you know, again, people rightly recognize that we have not yet gotten the economy back to where we want it to be, and their dissatisfaction is perfectly understandable .  Yes, I do think that with\u2014you know, that we do need to do whatever we can to move the economy towards price stability and maximum empl oyment.  We\u2019ll continue to do that so long as the tools that we have are efficacious and that they don\u2019t have costs or risk s or negative side effects that are worse than the benefits.

And our best estimates are that\u2014absent the supp ort of monetary policy, that the economy would be in a much deeper ditch and that unemployment would be much higher th an it is.  That being said, you know, again, people rightly recognize that we have not yet gotten the economy back to where we want it to be, and their dissatisfaction is perfectly understandable .  Yes, I do think that with\u2014you know, that we do need to do whatever we can to move the economy towards price stability and maximum empl oyment.  We\u2019ll continue to do that so long as the tools that we have are efficacious and that they don\u2019t have costs or risk s or negative side effects that are worse than the benefits.  We\u2019ll always be making that evaluation.   GREG IP.  Greg Ip with the Economist .  In response to Pedro\u2019s question, you said you would consider more MBS purchases when th e conditions were appropriate.  Could you elaborate on what conditions woul d be appropriate to do additiona l large-scale asset purchases, what your reaction function is right now?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, I don\u2019t think I can be as precise as you would like.  I\u2014the MBS purchases and Treasury s ecurities purchases are one set of tools that we have.  The other set of tools that we have  are communication tools, which essentially tie interest rate decisions to economic conditions or to time.  Thos e are\u2014with interest rate s close to zero, those are basically the two tools that we have, and we need to continue to work on how best to use them and in what combination to use them to achieve our objectives.   In terms of when we would use these, I thi nk all I can say is that the Committee will have to look at the outlook, and if it judges that we are falling sufficiently far short of our objectives in terms of inflation falling at or below its target and growth being insufficient, and that we believe that monetary stimulus would be beneficial , you know, then the Committee obviously would try November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 15 of 22  to take corrective action.  But I can\u2019t\u2014you know , it\u2019s a Committee decision, we\u2019ll have to look at the outlook.

I will say that that forecast we have is satisfact ory in one dimension, in the sense that inflation remains low and stable, but it is very unsatisfactory in terms of  the rate of growth of the economy, the rate at which unemployment comes dow n.  So I think the judgment we\u2019re going to have to make is, do the tools we have\u2014are those t ools likely to be sufficiently effective?  Or do they bear costs and risks that would make them  less effective or not worth using?  So it\u2019s a judgment we\u2019re going to have to co ntinue to make.

In the European debt deal that may or may not come to pass, it\u2019s been said that the ba nks operating there\u2014the bi g banks\u2014have all agreed that a 9 percent Tier 1 capital ra tio is appropriate.  A lot of U.S.  banks have been arguing that they can\u2019t afford to do that.  It will reduce lending, but it would also put them at a competitive disadvantage internationally.  With that happeni ng in Europe, do you think it\u2019s appropriate that the big banks in the U.S. should accept such a Tier 1 capital requirement, and how does that development stand at this point?    November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 16 of 22\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, we are co mmitted to, and are in the process of, implementing Basel III, which has a basic require ment including a buffer of 7 percent, and then additional surcharges for the largest institutions.  We think that\u2019s an a ppropriate framework.  I\u2019m not sure that the 9 percent that Europeans are talk ing about is really comparable to this, to the capital requirements that we are imposing, or will be imposing, on U.S. banks.  For example, the composition of their capital is not, as far as I understand, purely common equity.  I do not know what risk weights are being applied to the a ssets.  So there are a number of questions of comparability.  My expectation and hope is that \u2014over the medium term, that the Europeans who agreed to the Basel III conditions will ensure that their banks meet the Basel III standards over time.  Of course, that\u2019s being pha sed in over a number of years so as not to jeopardize in any way the recovery.  But, over the remainder of this de cade, we anticipate implementing all of the key elements of Basel III in  the United States. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Luca DiLeo with Dow Jones.   Mr. Chairman, you\u2019ve partly addressed this, but there\u2019s something I still fail to understa nd.  Given that your fore cast is still so gloomy for employment through 2014, given that you\u2019re not worried about inflation, and given that you said that MBS is a viable op tion, why not act today?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: So, as you point out, our forecast is not a very satisfactory one in the sense that unemployment is very high and growth is very slow.  We have taken a lot of actions.  Let me be very clear that the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy is highly accommodative now\u2014we brought rates close to zer o, we have done $2 trillion worth of asset purchases, we have made commitments about rates, we\u2019ve extended the maturity of our portfolio\u2014so we have taken a lot of steps, including steps at th e last two meetings, so we are being very aggressive in providing moneta ry accommodation.  I was asked before about November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 17 of 22  conditions for further accommodation.  Well, we are prepared to do that, and we will continue to observe, you know, how the economy evolves.  You know, what we have is a projection; there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty there.  A nd so it will be very important to  see, you know, what actually happens in terms of financial market conditions and economic growth.  So, but we are prepared to take further action.  We\u2019ve already taken quite  a bit of action, but we\u2019r e prepared to do more, and we have the tools to do more if that\u2019s appropriate.  Again, while I do not shirk the responsibility of the Fed having to do what it can to meet its  mandate, obviously, a broad range of policies can affect growth and employment, a nd I hope that there will be a range of actions that will complement and supplement the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the LA Times .  You mentioned before the streak of bad luck that struck the economy earl ier this year.  With the latest developments in Europe this week, where the debt deal seemi ngly was done and now the rug was pulled out, are you getting the sense that this economy just ca n\u2019t catch a break?  And how would you advise average Americans to deal with these continue d shocks to the economy and to the financial markets?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, I don\u2019t want  to make excuses.  Again, we did overestimate the pace of recovery for some fundamental reasons having to do with, as I mentioned, the time taken to achieve financial repa ir, the state of the hous ing market, and so on.  But that being said, as I indicate d earlier, there has been a certain  amount of bad luck, and I think the volatility in financial market s associated with the European  situation has been\u2014along with volatility associated with the U.S. fiscal conditions , has been a drag on recovery.  I think it\u2019s part of the reason why the second half of 2011 was less strong than we anticipated when I was here at the last press conference in June .  So there has been that concer n.  It\u2019s showing up in Americans\u2019 November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 18 of 22  confidence and sentiment.  You can see that righ t now consumer confidence is about where it was in the depths of recession; th at\u2019s very discouraging.  To some  extent, at least, it will be a drag on consumer\u2019s willingness to spend and to invest.   My best advice to Americans is to continue to live your lives, though, and to continue to think about your personal situat ion and try to make smart decisions based on your own financial position.  Clearly, Americans are trying to improve their balance sheets; they\u2019re trying to pay down debt.  That\u2019s, of course, important.  At th e same time, you want to  make smart decisions, you want to make good investments,  you want to budget properly.  So  financial literacy is a big part of this, and lack of financia l literacy was one of the things that got us into this mess in the first place.  So I would advise pe ople to try to be smart about th eir finances.  Unfortunately, we can\u2019t disassociate ourselves from Europe; the th ings that are happening there do affect us, and that\u2019s an unfortunate fact.  I hope  very much that the Europeans will find a set of solutions that will allow markets to calm down and take off some  of the headwinds from the U.S. economy. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Robi n Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, could you explain the menu of options that the Comm ittee has for improving its communication about when it might raise interest rates and what the conditions are in which it might do that?  For example, might it makes sense for the Fed to publish a forecast of its own future interest rates, and what\u2019s the advantages and disa dvantages of that?  Thank you. \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, again, as I no ted in my opening remarks, no decisions have been made, so I want to be very clear that no final\u2014you know, there is no final outcome here in this discussion.  But cl early, there\u2019s a range of things that we can do.  We can provide more information about our objec tives, for example.  We could provide information about where we want inflation to be in the long term, for exam ple.  We can also provide information about the November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 19 of 22  future path of interest rates, which we\u2019ve done to some extent via our \u201cmid-2013\u201d language in the statement.  An alte rnative approach, which Charlie Evans a nd others have suggested, is to tie that to economic conditions and to provide more  information about under what circumstances we would raise rates.  That is certain ly something that we have discu ssed and I think is an interesting alternative.  There\u2019s a lot of interest in using the survey of economic projections in constructive ways as we have up until now to provide inform ation to the public about our plans.  And in particular, using the SEP as a way of giving in formation about our future policy decisions is something that\u2019s on the table.  There\u2019s no decision  made about that, but th at\u2019s one direction that we might find productive. \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Michelle Fleury, BBC News.  You mentioned, obviously, that Europe and what\u2019s happening there has an imp act here on the U.S. economy.  To what degree can the Fed do little more than react to events abroad?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, it is a bit frustrating.  Obviously, the key decisionmakers in Europe are the European leaders and economic policymakers there, and ultimately it\u2019s their responsibility  to find solutions to this very difficult problem.  Of course, I and the Treasury Secretary and other economic policymakers in United States do confer and meet with European policymakers on a regular ba sis, and we give our advice, for what it\u2019s worth\u2014sometimes they take it, sometimes they  don\u2019t.  But, obviously, they\u2019re the ones who have to make those decisions.  So what we can do, really, is only a couple of things.  One is that we can look at our own financial institutions a nd try to assess the exposures and the linkages between our institutions and thos e in Europe and the sovereign de bt in Europe, and we\u2019ve been doing that on a consistent basis.  We\u2019ve looked also, of course, with ot her regulators at money market mutual funds and other types of financial institutions that have connections to Europe.  November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 20 of 22  So that\u2019s one thing that we can do.  And the ot her thing that we can do is stand ready, if necessary, to provide whatever support the br oader economy needs and the financial system needs, should things worsen.  I mean, we ar e hopeful that the latest measures, vigorously implemented, will indeed ultimately reduce these st resses, but in the case that things do get worse, both monetary policy and our policies of lender of last resort are available to insulate the U.S. economy from the effects. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Katherine Lewis for Bankrate.com.  Can you talk about what impact you\u2019ve seen from Operation Twist on longer-term CD rates and investment-grade bond yields?  And do you have any message for people who are relying on those kinds of instruments for income?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Sure.  It \u2019s a little bit early to full y assess the effects of what we call the maturity extension program.  But it do es seem to be having, at least in a preliminary sense\u2014it does seem to be having the intended ef fect of lowering longer-term interest rates and twisting the yield curve, as was an ticipated.  That, in turn, should  lead to still lower mortgage rates and other interest rates wh ich are relevant to the economy.  We are quite aware that very low interest rates, particularly for a protracted period, do have co sts for a lot of people.  They have costs for savers.  We have complaints from  banks that complain that their net interest margins are affected by low interest rates.  Pensio n funds will be affected if low interest rates for a protracted period require them to make larg er contributions.  So we are aware of those concerns, and we take th em very seriously.   I think the response is, though, that there is a greater good here, which is the health and recovery of the U.S. economy, and for that purpose we\u2019ve been keeping monetary policy conditions accommodative, trying to support the r ecovery, trying to suppor t job creation.  After November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 21 of 22  all, savers are not going to get very good return s in an economy which is in a deep recession.  I mean, ultimately, if you want to earn money on your investments, you have to invest in an economy which is growing.  And so, we believe th at our policy will ultimately benefit not just workers and firms and households in general, but will benefit savers as well, as the returns that they can earn on their investments will impr ove with the improvement in the economy. \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report .  Given how hard it has been to bring down unemployment in the past, why ar e you confident you have the tools to bring it down in the future?  \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Well, we have the ability to provide more stimulus and accommodation.  We believe that a good bit of the unemployment that we are seeing is what economists would call cyclical unemployment\u2014th at is, unemployment arising because of inadequate demand in the economy.  If that\u2019s  the case, then a m onetary policy\u2014by lowering interest rates, making financial conditions  more accommodative\u2014should stimulate demand, should stimulate spending, and over a period of time, that will help bring down cyclical unemployment.  That is something that we know  from a lot of experience, and, although it\u2019s been a very slow process here, th ere\u2019s no reason to think that the sa me basic effect will not work in this case as well.   Now, it\u2019s also possible that part of the in crease in unemployment reflects so-called structural factors\u2014mismatches between worker  skills and job opportun ities, loss of skills, geographical mismatch, et cetera.  And to the extent  that that\u2019s the case, then monetary policy is much less effective because in that case, only ot her kinds of labor market policies really can make progress against that type of unemployment.  But again, I do think that  a considerable part of the unemployment that we are seeing is cycli cal and is thus amenable to monetary policy. November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL 22 of 22  Final comment:  Cyclical unemployment, left untreated, so to speak, for a long time can become structural unemployment as people lose skills,  as they lose attachment to the labor force, as their work networks dry up and so on.  So in that  respect, it\u2019s important for us to try to address the unemployment problem in a sense while it \u2019s still amenable to monetary policy. \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: ENE.

We did see some  improvement in the third quarter, a modest improvement.  We saw, for example,  stronger consumption spending, a reasonable amount of capital investment, lower inventorie s, therefore suggesting more production in the fourth quarter, so it looks like the fourth quarter  as well will be a moderate-growth quarter.  So there was some improvement\u2014some improvement, at least early in th e period, in financial markets, although some of that has been reversed.  So that was part  of the situation that we were acknowledging in our statement, that\u2019s true.

Additionally, they will reinvest principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities into agency MBS to further ease conditions in mortgage markets.The FOMC regularly reviews and adjusts the size and composition of their securities holdings. The committee has submitted projections for economic growth, unemployment rate, and inflation rate, with longer-run projections indicating participants' assessments of the economy's normal rates assuming appropriate monetary policy and no further shocks.The Committee expects moderate economic growth in the coming quarters due to various factors such as the troubled housing sector, tight credit conditions, and fiscal consolidation.

The unemployment rate is also projected to decline only gradually, with a central tendency of 8.5 to 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012.The unemployment rate is expected to continue rising and remain above the normal rate, indicating slow progress in economic activity and labor market conditions. There are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, particularly due to concerns about European fiscal and banking issues, which have had adverse effects on confidence and growth.Inflation is expected to settle at or below the target rate of 2 percent, as resource utilization remains low and inflation expectations remain stable.

Our job is to do what's best for the economy and be free from political pressures. The criticism about inflation risk is not valid as inflation has averaged about 2 percent in the last five years, while unemployment remains a concern.", "'QUESTION': Was the letter appropriate?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke declined to comment on the appropriateness of the letter, emphasizing the importance of considering input from all sources and making decisions based on the interests of the American people and the economy.", "QUESTION: Has the Fed discussed the idea of nominal GDP targeting and what are your views on the advantages and disadvantages of that approach?\nANSWER: The Fed has discussed nominal GDP as an indicator to add to the list of variables they consider, but they believe that their existing framework, which looks at both employment and price stability, allows them to communicate effectively about future monetary policy. They are not currently considering a radical change in their approach.", "'QUESTION': Are the protesters right in saying that the Fed is part of the problem and can the Fed do anything to promote a more equitable economy?\n'ANSWER': The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions. The Fed's actions in stabilizing the financial system were to prevent a collapse of the economy, not to preserve bankers' salaries. The Fed is currently focused on supporting economic growth and job creation, but addressing inequality is best done through creating jobs.", "QUESTION: Does the Fed's forecast suggest that short-term interest rates could be raised before unemployment reaches 8 percent or lower, and how should people interpret these messages?\n\nANSWER: The statement says \"at least\" mid-2013, so it could be later than that. The market is currently expecting a later liftoff. The Fed wants to provide more clarity on the conditions for raising rates but hasn't reached that point yet. The \"at least\" does not imply a move in mid-2013 with the described conditions.", "QUESTION: What is the Fed's appetite for a renewed push into large-scale mortgage-backed securities purchases?\n\nANSWER: The Fed would like to return its portfolio to Treasuries only, but currently reinvests mortgage-backed securities to support the housing sector.

The approval as a primary dealer did not constitute a seal of approval, and the Fed suffered no losses from transactions with the company.", "'QUESTION': Can you clarify if this is an isolated case or the beginning of something bigger?\n'ANSWER': It seems to be an isolated case, and we are keeping an eye on its potential effects on funding markets and other areas. However, there hasn't been any major impact on financial stability so far.", "'QUESTION': Should the Fed be monitoring its primary dealers on an ongoing basis?\n'ANSWER': Only if the Fed is the supervisor. In this case, the SEC and the CFTC are the appropriate supervisors for this company, as it is a combination of a broker-dealer and a futures commission merchant. The company does not qualify as a SIFI under the provisional guidance issued by the FSOC, so the Fed has no basis to oversee it.", "'QUESTION': Is there a systematic error or blind spot behind the overly optimistic economic forecasts and what is being done to understand the mistakes?\n'ANSWER': The severity of the financial crisis, dysfunction of the housing market, and other factors like household deleveraging have been more severe and persistent than initially believed, slowing down the recovery.

However, the effects on the mortgage market have been blunted due to tight credit standards. Despite this, monetary policy has still influenced economic growth and job creation. The Fed has successfully kept inflation close to 2 percent and helped the economy recover from contraction through rate cuts and asset purchases. The Fed will continue to evaluate the efficacy of its tools in achieving price stability and maximum employment.", "'QUESTION': What conditions would be appropriate for additional large-scale asset purchases?\n'ANSWER': The decision to use additional large-scale asset purchases, such as MBS and Treasury securities, would depend on the Committee's assessment of the economic outlook. If inflation falls below its target and growth is insufficient, and if the Committee believes that monetary stimulus would be beneficial, they would take corrective action to ensure the recovery continues and maintain stable prices.", "'QUESTION': Does the forecast table indicate that further action would be required if there is no improvement?\n'ANSWER': The forecast table shows satisfactory inflation but unsatisfactory economic growth and unemployment rate.

Americans should continue to live their lives, make smart financial decisions, improve their balance sheets, and be financially literate. The situation in Europe does affect the U.S. economy, and it is hoped that the Europeans will find solutions to calm the markets.", "QUESTION: Could you explain the options the Committee has for improving communication about raising interest rates and the advantages and disadvantages of publishing a forecast of future interest rates?\n\nANSWER: No decisions have been made, but options include providing more information about objectives and long-term inflation targets, as well as future interest rate paths. Another approach is tying rate increases to economic conditions. Using the survey of economic projections to inform the public about future policy decisions is also being considered.", "'QUESTION': To what degree can the Fed do little more than react to events abroad?\n'ANSWER': The Fed can only assess the exposures and linkages between US and European financial institutions, and stand ready to provide support to the broader economy and financial system if necessary. They give advice to European policymakers but ultimately it is their responsibility to find solutions.", "'QUESTION': Can you talk about the impact of Operation Twist on longer-term CD rates and investment-grade bond yields, and do you have a message for people relying on those instruments for income?\n'ANSWER': It is still too early to fully assess the effects of the maturity extension program, but it seems to be lowering longer-term interest rates and twisting the yield curve as intended. This should lead to lower mortgage rates and other relevant interest rates. We understand the concerns of low interest rates for savers and banks, but our priority is the health and recovery of the economy, which will ultimately benefit everyone, including savers.", "'QUESTION': Given how hard it has been to bring down unemployment in the past, why are you confident you have the tools to bring it down in the future?\n'ANSWER': We have the ability to provide more stimulus and accommodation through monetary policy. We believe that a significant portion of the unemployment is cyclical, meaning it is caused by inadequate demand in the economy. By lowering interest rates and making financial conditions more accommodative, we can stimulate demand and spending, which will help bring down cyclical unemployment. However, if the increase in unemployment is due to structural factors like skills mismatch or geographical mismatch, monetary policy is less effective and other labor market policies are needed. It is important to address the unemployment problem while it is still amenable to monetary policy to prevent it from becoming structural unemployment.", "'QUESTION': Is the FOMC considering less policy accommodation given the improvement seen in the third quarter?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC acknowledges some improvement in the third quarter, but the medium-term outlook has been downgraded and remains unsatisfactory. Additional stimulus or actions are still being considered to achieve a better outcome."]}
