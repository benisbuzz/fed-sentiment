T hanks for taking our question s.  You guys have cut rate s to zero, you\u2019 re buying up huge quantities of government debt \u2014I guess the question is, what more can you realistically do to help the economy, and where do you see a need for Congress to step in?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So let me say that we\u2019 re\u2014we\u2019re  commi tted to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.  We\u2019re going to use them, as I mentioned,   forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we \u2019re confident that we \u2019re solidly on the road to recovery a nd also to assure t hat that recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible.  As long as needed, we \u2019ll use them .  And I would just say, we have a number of dimensions on which we can still provide support to the economy.  As you know, our credit policies are not subje ct to a specific dollar limit.  They can be expanded as appropriate , and we can do new ones.  So we can continue to be part of the answer.  Will there be a need to do more , though?  I think the answer to that\u2014 that will be \u201cyes.\u201d  I would say, Congress has also reacted quite aggressively and strongly with the Cares Act and other  laws\u2014several other laws.  And that \u2019s appropriate.  With enhanced unemployment insurance and the P aycheck P rotection P rogram, we \u2019ve seen an extraordinary , historically large reaction.  But I would say that it may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the \u2014if the  recovery is to be a robust one.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Chair Powell .  Nick Timiraos of the Wa ll Street Journal .  I want to follow up on Jeanna \u2019s question and ask, what specifically do you think elected officials should consider in order to help return or hasten a stronger return to full employment?  And what policy tools did you discuss at your me eting today that might be used to stop a deflationary spiral?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So let me \u2014let me start \u2014I\u2019ll take the questions in the order you \u2014you gave them.  So in terms of, if I can say , legislative priorities, we don \u2019t\u2014we \u2019re not responsible for fiscal policy.  Those will be decisions for Congress to make .  But I would say that policies that protect workers, businesses, and households from avoidable insolvency, that keep businesses going so that they\u2019 re able to produce goods  and\u2014and to either hold on to their   employees or quickly rehire them, those are going to be key policies.  They \u2019ll come with a hefty price tag, but we would come out of this event eventually with \u2014with a stronger economy and with less long -run damage to the  economy.  So that \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s  a key thing that \u2014that , really , Congress could do over time.  In terms of what we can do, I mentioned, we have  our\u2014our credit facilities are\u2014 are wide open.  We can do more on that front.  In addition, you know, we \u2019ve had\u2014we\u2019ve had extensive discussions, as I \u2019ve mentioned\u2014done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over \u2014in coming months over a range of potential scenarios for the economy.  We do think that our \u2014our  policy stance today is right where it should be  for now.  As you know, we cut rates to the effective lower bound , we\u2014and we \u2019ve said that we\u2019 ll keep them there until we\u2019re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our goals.  With asset purchases, we\u2019 re continuing to purchase Treasury securities and agency M BS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning.  So we \u2019re doing those things , and I would say that we \u2019ll continue to use our tools as needs be.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, question\u2014Steve Liesman with CNBC.  I \u2019ve got two questions here.  First of all, why aren \u2019t you announcing or conducting a specific quantitative easing program ?  And \u2014and maybe you could explain what the context is now of the pur chases that will be m ade and the amounts that are to  come.  The second question I have is, are \u2014is the Federal Reserve really taking enough risk to help households and businesses here , in that you just said that the programs that are out there may be best fo r those who are able to repay loans.  B ut\u2014so don\u2019 t you have a series of programs   essentially lending only to those able to repay, which is essentially helping those who may need it the least?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, let me say  again, in terms of \u2014of asset purchases and \u2014and other measures, we \u2014we do think our \u2014our  policy stance is appropriate now.  We \u2019ve had discussions, as I\u2019ve mentioned, over time and done quite a bit of thinking about what we might do in the future.  We think, for now, our policy stance is appropriate.  We\u2019re not going to change it now.  And we \u2019re really waiting to see more from the economy.  There are a range of potential paths the economy could be on, and I think as\u2014as the time approaches for \u2014then we \u2019ll\u2014you know, we \u2019ll address your first question, which is about asset purchases.  So \u2014but that \u2019s not something we \u2019re doing today.  It\u2019 s\u2014it\u2019s something that we have talked about , and, you know , for now, we like our current policy stance. In terms of risk, so , you know, we operate under the laws that Congress passes .  And there are a number of aspects under section 13( 3), and you can see that they\u2019 ve permitted us to, I think, move very quickly and move into areas where we \u2019ve never been before and do so quite aggressively.  So I \u2014I think we \u2019re going places and providing help in places where we never have , and I\u2019m glad that we are.  I think it \u2019s appropriate that we are.  Nonetheless, these are lending powers .  And if you read sec tion 13( 3) of the Dodd-Frank \u2014or, the Federal Reserve Act , and I know you have , it does require that \u2014that we be secured to our satisfaction , and\u2014and we can \u2019t lend to insolvent companies.  You know, it \u2019s clear these are lending powers , and we are \u2014we are ultimately bound to\u2014to  implement the  laws that Congress gives us.  We \u2014we  do not make grants .  We can \u2019t make grants.  And I \u2014the reason I raised that in my remarks is that I just want to be clear on that.    We\u2014you know, we can do what we can do, and we will do it to the absolute limit of those powers.  We will \u2014we\u2019ll keep at it.  And you\u2014I just want people to know that we\u2019ll\u2014we will be at it with \u2014with  the legal authorities that we have until we get through this thing.  We will keep using our autho rities .  But there are authorities that we don\u2019 t have , and there may be a need for those authorities to be used as well as ours.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Hi, Chair Powell, it\u2019 s Heather Long from t he Washington Post .  I have two questions for you, both on timing.  The first, do you plan to launch the C orporate Credit F acility  and the Main Street lending facilities  in May or early May ?  Anything you can give us \u2014a sense on timing?  And the second, in the statement , you ref erred today \u2014the FOMC refers today to a lot of medium- term risks from the pandemic .  That sounds like you all think this is going to be a long recovery\u2014a long road to recovery.  Can you give any more guidance on how you all see this recovery taking shape?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.   So, in terms of those facilities, the corporate credit facilities are near being finalized and will be operating, I would say, soon\u2014fairly soon.  Main  Street facility  is\u2014we\u2019re close to announcing\u2014to issuing a new term sheet.  As you know, we put out a term sheet for comment a while back , and we got a couple thousand comments.  We\u2019ve carefully studied them.  We\u2019ve tried to reflect those in what we \u2019re doing now.  I think, with Main Street, there \u2019ll be at least a couple of different kinds of lending going on there.  It\u2014this is a broad area of the economy with many different kinds of credit needs , so we \u2019re going to keep at that for some time, I think, adding in sectors and lending products.  So I think we \u2019ll be at \u2014we \u2019ll   probably be continuing to work and expand Main Street  for some time , but it won \u2019t be done quite as quickly.  But the first part of it, I think, will be done fairly quickly.  In terms of our statement, so what we said was that we\u2014I \u2019ll just read the sentence.  It says:  \u201c [The] ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near  term and poses considerable risks  to the economic outlook over the medium term. \u201d  So the \u201c medium\u201d \u2014but what we meant by that, \u201c over the medium  term \u201d\u2014so , obviously, what we \u2019re talking about is, you know, not right now , in the very near term.  It\u2019 s between now and the long term , so the next year or so.  And I would point to a couple of \u2014of risks to the outlook that\u2014what  we were thinking of.  First is just the virus.   How long will it take to get it under control?  Will there be additional outbreaks?  Will there be drugs that can either treat it or\u2014 or a vaccine of some kind?  So there\u2019s \u2014all of that is very much shrouded in uncertainty.  The second issue\u2014and this is a very substantial one \u2014is just the possibility of \u2014of damage to the productive capacity of the economy through a couple of channels.  The first is just workers who\u2014if one is unemployed for an extended period, that person can\u2014can  lose the s kills that are needed, can lose touch with the labor force, and have difficulty restarting his or her career.  So that \u2019s a\u2014 that\u2019s a  feature of deep and long recessions, and that \u2019s something we \u2019ve got to watch out for.  Another is just businesses\u2014you know , these thousands of great medium - and small -sized businesses that we have all over the country .  They\u2019re worth so much more to the economy than the sum of their net assets.  They contain\u2014you know, they\u2019 re job creators , they \u2019re really important.  And if we s ee an unnecessary \u2014unnecessary insolvencies, a wave of those, that could be damaging to the performance of the economy over time.  So the good news is that we   have policies, as I mentioned in my remarks \u2014we have policies that can address those things, but not perfectly.  So that \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s  another risk.  The third thing I would point to is just the global dimension.  This is a very global phenomenon, and you are \u2014we \u2019re seeing economic data from around the globe which is very, very negative , and that, too, ca n weigh on U.S. economic performance over time.  I \u2014you know, I would say, just on the U.S.\u2014on the U.S. economy, there are things you can say, one can say.  The first is that, in the near term, we \u2019re going to see, you know, significant declines in economic activity, significant declines in employment, and increases in unemployment.  We \u2019re going to see that as a consequence of the virus and the measures we\u2019 re taking to protect ourselves from it. The next phases are more uncertain, highly uncertain, but we wil l go through a phase starting fairly soon where we begin to reopen the economy.  And probably the economic activity will pick  up as consumer spending picks up.  Consumer spending, as I mentioned, has gone down quite a lot.  It\u2019ll begin to pick up as people  start to return to their normal patterns of spending.  But the chances are that it won \u2019t go right back to where we were , because people will\u2014until the y\u2019re confident of \u2014that the virus is well and truly under control, then they will be somewhat probably rel uctant to \u2014to undertake certain kinds of activity.  So it may take some time for us to get back\u2014 it probably will take some time for us to get back  to\u2014you know, to a more normal level of unemployment and\u2014and, ultimately , to maximum employment.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Chair Powell.  You  didn\u2019 t firm up your guidance on\u2014this is James Politi from the Financial Times \u2014you didn \u2019t firm up your guidance on interest rates at this meeting .  And given the risks that you j ust outlined, under what circumstances would you strengthen the F ed\u2019s commitment to keep rates at the lower bound?  And is there any danger to   delaying\u2014delaying that plan?  Then , on the credit facilities, what kind of demand are you expecting for the progr ams that were set up under the Cares Act, and are you expecting them to rapidly reach capacity like the PPP plan did?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Okay .  So on the first, as I mentioned, you know, we moved very quickly, very aggressively.  We were the first to return to  the effective lower bound, where we are now.  We got there essentially right away, and we think that \u2019s the right place to be.  We think, if you look at surveys, you look at market pricing, the market expects us to\u2014 to be there for a good while , and that \u2019s appropriate.  So , you know, it \u2019s not as though the market is pricing in a near -term liftoff or anything like that.  And let me just say, we \u2019re going to not be in any hurry to withdraw these measures or to lift off.  We \u2019re going to wait until we \u2019re\u2014we\u2019re  quite confident that the economy is \u2014is well on the road to recovery.  So we don\u2019 t see\u2014we see our current stance and our current guidance \u2014and I would say the same thing about asset purchases\u2014 we see them as appropriate.   I\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve  also mentioned now a couple  times that we have done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over coming months, and that would, you know, depend on\u2014on where we are in \u2014in a range of potential economic scenarios.  So we \u2014we  were thinking about that all the time , but right now, for now, we think our current stance is appropriate.  So  we made no change in it today. Second question was , how \u2014so the thing about our facilities is , Treasury still has plenty of equity.  S o we \u2019ve said that  if\u2014if demand for our facilities is greater than we \u2019ve estimated, then we \u2019ll expand them.  And we have the ability to do that.  So it won\u2019 t be the way the \u2014the  Paycheck Protection Program  is, where there \u2019s a specific amount allocated \u2014appropriated for it, and\u2014and then there \u2019s no more money.  That \u2019s\u2014that  will be unlikely to happen here unless we exhaust T reasury \u2019s equity, and we \u2019re a long way from doing that.    The second thing I would say is \u2014and you\u2019 ve all seen this\u2014is when we announce these facilities \u2014and I mentioned this in my remarks \u2014it\u2019 s not  just the actual lending we do, it\u2019s the \u2014we build confidence in the market.  And private market participants come in .  And many companies that would\u2019 ve had to come to the F ed have now been able to finance themselves privately since we announced the \u2014the initial term sheet on \u2014on these facilities.  So that \u2019s a good thing.  Companies are out there financing, they \u2019re out there raising liquidity.  We haven \u2019t made any corporate loans to\u2014in those facilities .  We\u2019ve made the short -term money  market loans , but\u2014we haven\u2019 t made any of them.  And yet there \u2019s a tremendous amount of financing going on, and that \u2019s a good thing. So we \u2014for that reason, the ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict, because there is this announcement effect that reall y gets the market functioning again.  Of course, we have to follow through, though.  And we will follow through to validate that \u2014that  announcement effect \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Oh, hi, Chair Powell, and thanks for doing this.   I wanted to get your \u2014a little more expansion on the timing of recovery and the \u2014the  connection between the health response.  You said earlier, I think, that you thought the second half of the year could see a pretty robust rebound.  Is that now out  of the question?  And do you think a steady recovery is really possible until a vaccine \u2019s developed, given the patchwork of measures we \u2019ve seen taken around the states?  Is that going to really lead us to a steady path out , absent a vaccine\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, as you know, economic forecasts are always uncertain.  Today they\u2019 re unusually uncertain, and that \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s  really because so much of the performance of the economy depends on the path of the virus and the success of the measures we take to   control it, o ur success in reopenin g the economy,  and also the time it takes to develop new drugs.  And our tools, the thi ngs that we do, don\u2019t affect any of those things.  We \u2019re not experts on those things either , but what the experts tell us is that the outcomes are highly uncertain.  So this is an unusual , new kind of uncertainty added on top of our \u2014our  regular uncertainty . But I \u2014I will say, there \u2014I think there are a few things that you can say about \u2014about  the path ahead.  First, this time, now, is going to be a time of sharp contraction in economic activity, high unemployment .  Personal consumption expenditures have declined sharply, business investment as well .  Unemployment moved up.  We \u2019re going to see economic data for the second quarter that\u2019 s worse than any data we \u2019ve seen for the economy.  And they\u2019 re a direct consequence of the disease and the measures that we\u2019 re taking to protect ourselves from it.  So then we will enter this new phase, and we \u2014we \u2019re just beginning to maybe do that, where we will \u2014formal measures that require social distancing will be rolle d back gradually a nd at different paces in different parts of t he country.  And, in time, this \u2014during this period, the economy will begin to recover.  People will come out of their homes, start to spend again.  W e\u2019ll see unemployment go down, we \u2019ll see economic activity pick up.  And, you know, when will that be?  It \u2019s very hard to say.  But let \u2019s just say, for this purpose, that it \u2019s in the third quarter.  So, as I mentioned earlier, that \u2014that  could be a fairly, you know, a large increase.  Given the \u2014given the  size of the fall, the increase could also b e substantially  large, although it\u2019 s unlikely that it would bring us quickly, quickly all the way back to pre -crisis levels.  Of course, this is the period as well that carries the risk of new outbreaks of the virus, something we really want to avoid.  I think then, after  that period, at some point you will have \u2014you  know, the kind of formal social -distancing measures will \u2014will  be gone, but you\u2019 ll still be left with, probably, a level of   caution on the part of people who will \u2014who will  worry and probably keep worrying for some \u2014for some  time.  You would think that behavior will change as  people gain confidence .  So the \u2014the sooner we get the virus under control, the sooner people can regain that confidence and regain their economic activity.  I think trying to be really precise  about when that might happen and what the numbers might look like is \u2014I think  it\u2019s very tough to do that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.  Chairman Powell, you\u2019 ve noted a number of times over the last year that there \u2019s been a broadening out of job gains with marginalized workers, people who have been left out of the recovery over the 10- year period, finally making job gains , and\u2014particularly minorities, but also many other workers.  Do you worry that this recession is going to fall hardest on those workers who\u2019 ve struggled and just got job gains in the last year or two, and that it may take years from now before there are opportunities for them again?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes.  That \u2019s exactly what I worry ab out.  So unemployment has tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are\u2014tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum.  And it tends to come down\u2014come down faster as well, but it tends to go up faster and be much, much higher.  And w e were in a place\u2014only two months ago, we were well into \u2014beginning the second half of the 11th year is where we were , and every reason to think that it was ongoing.  We were hearing from minority \u2014low - and moderate -income and minority communities that this was the best labor market they \u2019d seen in their lifetime.  All the data supported that as well.  And it is heartbreaking, frankly, to see that all threatened now.  All the more need for our urgent response \u2014and also that of Congress, which has been urgent an d large \u2014and to do what we can to avoid longer -run damage to the economy,  which is what I \u2014I   mentioned earlier.  This is an exogenous event that \u2014you know, just, it happened to us.  It wasn \u2019t because there was something wrong with the economy.  And I think it  is important that we do everyth ing we can to avoid that longer -run damage and try to get back to where we were , because I do very much have that concern.  I think everyone is suffering here, but I think those who are least able to \u2014to bear it are the ones who are, you know, losing their jobs and losing their incomes and have little cushion to\u2014you know, to protect them in times like that.  So, yes, that\u2019s a very big concern\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, I\u2019m Victoria Guida with Politico.   The Paycheck Protection Program  has experienced some logistical problems because of the speed at which all of this is happening.  For the Main Street lending facilities , which will also work through banks, what lessons are you taking away from that?  And then, more broadly, you know, you mentioned earlier this year that the federal debt was on an unsustainable path.  And I was just wondering, for Republicans that are starting to get worried about how much fiscal spending they \u2019re having to do in this crisis , you know, whether that should be a concern for them .\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So a couple things.  This is different from the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, in two ways.  One is , these are not grants, these are loans.  So I don\u2019 t know that the demand will be quite as strong as \u2014as it has been for the PPP.  I don\u2019 t know that.  And the second thing is, we won\u2019 t run out of money.  You know, it \u2019s not a limited pot , so there won\u2019 t be this incentive to try to get there first and that sort of thing.  So I \u2019m\u2014I\u2019m  hopeful we \u2014we  will very much try to learn as much as possible from that facility and from all the other ones , too.  We have a lot to learn here, so we \u2019ll certainly be trying to do that.    In terms of fiscal concern , so  I\u2014you know, I \u2019m\u2014for many years, I \u2019ve been, before the Fed, I have longtime been an advocate for the need for the United States to return to a sustainable path from a fiscal perspective at the federal level.  We have not been on such a path for some time , which means \u2014just means that the debt is growing faster than the economy.  This is not the time to act on those concerns.  This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to \u2014to do what we can to support the economy and try to get through this with as little damage to the longer -run productive capacity of the economy as possible.  The time will come again \u2014and reasonably soon, I think\u2014where we can \u2014where we can  think about a long- term way to get our fiscal house in order.  And we absolutely need to do that.  But this is not the time to be \u2014in my personal view, this is not the time to \u2014to let that concern, which is a very serious concern, but \u2014to let that get in the way of us winning this battle , really.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Oh, yes.  T hank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  Now, given the amount of stimulus on the fiscal side and monetary policy side, how much weight do you give to finding a vaccine , from clearing that uncertainty you talked about around treatment and whatnot , for the Federal Reser ve pulling back on some of the F ed\u2019s actions and raising the rates from the zero lower bound?   Also, when does that Main Street lending facility get deploye d?  Because you  talked about \u201csoon\u201d \u2014you know, some  businesses are in need now.   Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, so we don\u2019 t\u2014we\u2019re not in a position to make, you know, a reliable assessment of when a vaccine or a therapeutic drug would be ready, a nd so we\u2019re not going to set our policies based on\u2014on  our estimate of that.  We\u2019re going to just provide the   support that we can with the tools that we have, and we \u2019re going to keep doing that until \u2014until  the recovery \u2019s well under  way.  In terms of Main Street, so you know the story.  We put out a term sheet , we got a lot of comments, we took those very much to heart.  We \u2019ve spent a great deal of time here.  It \u2019s a challenging space , because it \u2019s many different kinds of borrowers \u2014they have different needs, differ ent sizes of companies.  A nd so, we\u2019re \u2014as I mentioned, we \u2019re very close to announcing a new term sheet , which will then become operative fairly quickly.  My guess is, though, that we \u2019ll keep \u2014we\u2019ll keep  looking to add products and add different kinds of bor rowers to that as we go.  And we \u2019re\u2014we\u2019re well aware of the importance of \u2014of doing it as quickly as possible.  We, here, you know, we \u2019re very much in touch with \u2014with  the urgency of that need.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Powell, it \u2019s Don  Lee from the  L.A. Time s.  I just wanted to follow up on a question \u2014the question on the labor market.  I know you said that it \u2019s highly uncertain but, you know, there are analysts who think that we \u2019ll have very high unemployment until even the end of next year, as high as 9 percent.  And , at this point, what \u2014can you just talk a little bit more about what you see as the path of employment in the coming months and into next year?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sure.  So unemployment \u2019s going to go up to a high number in the second quarter \u2014uncertain what the number will be.  When \u2014and that \u2019s because so much economic activity has been shuttered , really , as we take social -distancing measures.  And the \u2014so sometime fairly soo n here, and probably gradually and at different paces at different parts of the country, we \u2019ll see the social -distancing measures rolled back.  People will begin to spend more money.  It\u2019 s, really , consumer spending has fallen precipitously.  And once that  starts to happen, people will get hired back and unemployment will go back down.  I don\u2019 t think it \u2019ll get   anywhere near the historically low levels that we had in \u2014as recently as February, 3\u00bd percent.  I think it will take some time for that to happen, for  us to get back to anything that resembles maximum employment. But, I mean, the main thing we want is , we want to get back on that road.  We want to get that\u2014that recovery going and get people back to work as fast as we can.  Not faster than we can, but as  fast as we can.  The main thing is to get into that stage where the economy\u2019 s healing, where we have the disease under control, where we don \u2019t, you know, take too much risk of \u2014of second and third waves and that sort of thing, and get people back to work.  And, you know, it\u2019s\u2014again, the path of it is highly uncertain, but we will\u2014we will  be there with our tools , supporting the economy and supporting that recovery.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  After the financial cri sis, banks were instructed to up their capital so they could weather an economic shock.  What kind of steps do you think we need to take for the economy writ large to make it more resilient to this kind of shock?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Can you just say that part \u2014you\u2019re a little bit low volume \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Yes.  What kind of steps could we take to help the economy as a whole be more resilient to this kind of exogenous shock?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, it \u2019s an extraordinary, extraordinary shock, unlike anything, certainly , that \u2019s happened in my lifetime.  And a couple things come to mind.  I \u2014I think the time will come for a careful assessment of the answers to those questions.  It\u2019s early to be asking them.  We\u2019re still putting out the fire.  We\u2019re still trying to win.   And I think we \u2019ll be at that for a while.    You know, but  I\u2019d point to a couple of directions.  You know, we worked hard to strengthen the banks :  much higher levels of capital , liquidity, far greater sense of what the risks are they \u2019re running and how  to manage them.  So the breakdowns that we \u2019ve seen in market function have really been in the capital markets.  And I don\u2019 t\u2014I wouldn\u2019 t rush in with prudential regulation into the capital markets .  But I think \u2014and we did plenty of things \u2014you know, triparty \u2014you know, we did a lot of reform in the capital markets :  money market reform, triparty repo reform, central clearing, all these important things.  But there \u2014there  will no doubt be \u2014with this \u2014the size and force of this shock will no doubt  reveal weaknesses in the financial architecture , and we \u2019ll have to go to work on those. I\u2014I also think  it\u2014you know, it tells you the importance of \u2014of getting your fiscal house in order.  The U.S. really hadn\u2019 t\u2014really hadn\u2019t  gotten back to where we needed to get on fiscal policy.  And, you know, so we \u2014we  had an already high level of debt to GDP , and rising quickly, when th is shock arrived.  Now, we have the fiscal capacity to deal with it, I believe.  But we will need to \u2014idea lly, you would go into an unexpected shock like this with a \u2014with a  much stronger fiscal\u2014fiscal  posture.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, given the demand drop, demand shock, and the drop in oil prices, do you anticipate that we mi ght see any kind of deflation, even for a very short period, that would require a Fed response?   If we g et a negative print on CPI or PCE, how should people think about that?  And second question\u2014 there is a disconnect, it appears, between the markets and th e economic outlook right now.  And I know you said that this isn\u2019 t the time to worry about moral   hazard, but do you worry, with the size of stimulus that you and the Congress are putting into the economy, there could be financial stability problems as this  goes along?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: In terms of inflation, we think that inflation is very closely and strongly related to inflation expectations.  And during the G lobal F inancial C risis, there was a concern that we might see deflation, but it didn\u2019 t happen.  Inflation  expect \u2014inflation  tended to move down a little bit, as it will when demand is weak.  And \u2014but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States.  They have in other places in the world, though, over the past 25 years.  The re\u2019s been downward pressure on inflation, really , for several decades now.  So, I would say, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, then we shouldn\u2019 t see deflation.  And the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to maintaining 2 percent inflatio n over time.  So we \u2019ll be there to work on that.  I think you asked, really , about headline inflation.  If \u2014if low energy prices\u2014very low energy prices were to \u2014were to  drop headline inflation negative, I\u2014I would hope that people would see through that \u2014and w e\u2019ll be monitoring it  very carefully \u2014would see through it , though, and look to core , which is a better predictor of future inflation.  So, needless to say, we\u2019 ll be keeping very close track of that.  In terms of the markets, you know, our \u2014our  concern is that they be working.  We \u2019re not\u2014we \u2019re not focused on the level of asset prices in particular, it \u2019s just \u2014markets are trying to price in something that is so uncertain as to be unknowable , which is the path of this virus globally and its effect on the economy.  And that \u2019s very, very hard to do.  That\u2019s why you see volatility the way it\u2019 s been, market  reacting to \u2014to things with a lot of volatility.  But, you know, what we \u2019re trying to assure , really , is that the market is working.  The market is assessing risks, lenders are lending, borrowers are borrowing, asset prices are moving in response to events.    That\u2019s\u2014that is really important for everybody, including\u2014 including, you know, the \u2014the  most vulnerable among us , because if \u2014if markets stop working  and credit stops flowing, then you see\u2014that \u2019s when you see, you know, very sharp negative \u2014even more negative economic outcomes. So I think our measures have \u2014have  supported market function pretty well.  You know, we\u2019re going to stay very careful, carefully monitoring that.  But I think it\u2019 s been good to see markets working again .  Particularly , the flow of credit in the economy has been a positive thing, as businesses have been able to build up their liquidity buffers  and households have been able to be home \u2014you know, people have been home, you know, concerned about their jobs, but they \u2019re not concerned about the financial system collapsing as they were in 2008 and \u20190 9\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Chris Rugaber over at AP, thank you.  I guess I had two questions.  I wanted to start on the unemployment picture and nail down a little bit how you see \u2014how you see  things going from here.  You did talk about potential loss of skills over time.  So are you worried about structural changes in job markets that would keep unemployment high and, therefore, potenti ally beyond the ability of the F ed to do anything about, which is  something that was debated, as you know, after the last recession , and then eventually, of course, the unemployment rate did go lower than people thought ? Second ques tion is just on the money from T reasury, the $454 billion.  I t sounds like you want to keep that in reserve for programs that have high demand, such as the Main Street program.  Are you willing to use that to backstop, say, a program that is having more losses?  I mean, you know, what \u2019s your tolerance for loss among that $ 454 billion?  Thank you. \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, in terms of the labor market, the \u2014the risk to\u2014of damage to people \u2019s skills and their careers and their lives is a function of time to some extent.  So the longer one is unemployed, the harder it gets, I think\u2014 and we \u2019ve probably all seen this in our lives \u2014the harder it is to get back into the workforce and get back to where you were, if you ever do get back to where you were.  So, you know, longer and deeper downturns have had\u2014have left more of a mark, generally, in that dimension with the labor force.  And so that \u2019s why \u2014as I mentioned, that\u2019s why the urgency in doing wha t we can to prevent that longer -run damage.  It doesn\u2019 t have to be that way.  We won \u2019t be able to limit all of it , but we do have the tools to\u2014to  do what we can to \u2014to keep people in touch wi th the labor force and working a nd also out of insolvency, too.  It doesn \u2019t seem fair that people should lose everything they have, including their homes, over this.  So, nonetheless, there will be some of that.  But we do have some tools to ameliorate tha t. In terms of the \u2014so in terms of the \u2014the  money, you know , the $454 billion, it \u2019s a couple things.  First, the Treasury Secretary  really has\u2014has  authority over that, right?  And it stands in front of our losses.  So, you know \u2014but I do think we are \u2014we \u2019re clearly moving into areas where there is more risk than there has been in the past.  And that \u2019s okay.  I think that \u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do.  This is \u2014this is  a very unusual time.  And so\u2014but in terms of the \u2014of the  way to think about that money, I think that \u2019s really a question for the Treasury D epartment.  You know, we are \u2014we set up the facilities, and we work very, very closely and successfull y and collaboratively with the T reasury on this, but that \u2014that  particula r aspect of it falls more to the Secretary \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I \u2019m wondering what you would say to savers who are hurt by very low interest rates and   maybe going into investments maybe in the stock market that aren \u2019t so great for them.  And also, I\u2019m wondering if you can give us any more of a clue as to how long you think we \u2019re going to have interest rates near zero .\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a number of channels in a positive way.  Lower interest rates support economic activity through channels that we \u2014overall, through channels that we understand reasonably well.  T hey make it cheaper to borrow, they make \u2014they drive , you know, your cost s of borrowing down.  They do\u2014they do  raise asset prices, including the value of your home.  If your saver owns a home or has a 401(k), your saver will benefit from that.  But for people who are really, really just relying on their bank savings account earnings, this is \u2014you know, that \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s \u2014you\u2019 re not going to benefit from low interest rates.  But we \u2014you know, we have to look out for the overall economy.  Low interest rates suppor t employment, they support economic activity, and those are our mandates.  And I think for the overall good of the economy, low interest rates are a good thing.  And that\u2019s  not to say they\u2019 re good for every single person, but that shouldn\u2019 t stop us from doing what we think is \u2014is good for the whole. In terms of how low , I really don \u2019t want to speculate .  You know, we will turn to questions like that soon enough.  B ut the \u2014in terms of how long we \u2019ll stay and under what conditions we \u2019ll stay at the effective lo wer bound, those are just exactly the things we \u2019re thinking about. Right now we like the place we are.  We\u2019ve said that we\u2019 ll keep our rates where they are until we \u2019re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our \u2014our  goals.  So that \u2019s where we are.  We \u2019re leaving\u2014we\u2019re not changing that   guidance today , you know , but it \u2019ll be\u2014that means we\u2019 re going to be very patient.  That means we\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re  not going to be in any hurry to move rates up.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you very much.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: .

The forceful measures taken to control the virus have halted the economy, impacting businesses and individuals, particularly those who are least equipped to bear the burden, but these measures are seen as an investment in our overall well-being.The COVID-19 pandemic has had severe effects on the economy, with millions of workers losing their jobs and household spending plummeting. Industries such as hotels, airlines, restaurants, and retailers have been hit particularly hard. The economic downturn is expected to be unprecedented, and the severity and duration will depend on how quickly the virus is controlled and the policy actions taken to support recovery.The Federal Reserve is committed to using all available tools to support the economy during this challenging time, including maintaining near-zero interest rates until the economy has recovered. However, it is acknowledged that lowering interest rates alone cannot fully address the economic disruptions caused by the virus, and ensuring access to credit is crucial for mitigating the damage and facilitating the recovery.The FOMC has been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit, promote market functioning, and improve monetary policy transmission. Their purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities have helped improve market conditions, and they will continue these purchases as needed to foster more accommodative financial conditions. Additionally, they are undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial system and support the flow of credit, benefiting the economy by providing financing and improving market functioning.The Federal Reserve is utilizing emergency lending powers extensively, with support from Congress and the Treasury, to address the current circumstances. These lending powers will be used forcefully until a solid recovery is achieved, emphasizing that they are not spending powers. However, for some borrowers, direct fiscal support may be necessary instead of taking on difficult-to-repay loans.The Cares Act and other legislation provide direct help to people, businesses, and communities, which can make a critical difference in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy. At the Fed, we're doing all we can to help American families and businesses weather this difficult period and assure a robust recovery when the virus is under control.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': What more can the Federal Reserve realistically do to help the economy and where is there a need for Congress to step in?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is committed to using all available tools to support the economy and ensure a robust recovery. They can expand credit policies and implement new ones as needed. Congress has already taken aggressive action with the Cares Act, but it may be necessary for both the Fed and Congress to provide further support for a strong recovery.", "'QUESTION': What should elected officials consider to help return to full employment and what policy tools were discussed to stop a deflationary spiral?\n'ANSWER': Congress should prioritize policies that protect workers, businesses, and households from insolvency and support business continuity. The Federal Reserve will continue to use its credit facilities and can do more if needed. Monetary policy is currently appropriate, with interest rates at the lower bound and asset purchases to support market functioning.", "'QUESTION': Why isn't the Federal Reserve announcing or conducting a specific quantitative easing program? Is the Federal Reserve taking enough risk to help households and businesses, or are they only lending to those who can repay loans?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve believes their current policy stance is appropriate and they are waiting to see more from the economy before making any changes. They have discussed asset purchases but are not implementing them at this time. In terms of risk, they operate within the laws passed by Congress and are limited in their lending powers. They cannot lend to insolvent companies and are bound to implement the laws given to them. They will continue to use their authorities to the fullest extent possible.", "'QUESTION': Do you plan to launch the Corporate Credit Facility and the Main Street lending facilities in May or early May? Can you give any more guidance on how you all see this recovery taking shape?\n'ANSWER': The corporate credit facilities are near being finalized and will be operating soon. The Main Street facility is close to issuing a new term sheet. Main Street will involve different kinds of lending and will continue to expand for some time. The recovery will be a gradual process, with significant declines in economic activity and employment in the near term, followed by a phase of reopening the economy and gradual improvement in consumer spending. It may take some time to return to a more normal level of unemployment and maximum employment.", "'QUESTION': Under what circumstances would the Fed strengthen its commitment to keep rates at the lower bound and is there any danger in delaying that plan? What kind of demand are you expecting for the credit facilities and will they rapidly reach capacity like the PPP plan did?\n\n'ANSWER': The Fed believes its current stance on interest rates and guidance is appropriate and will not be in a hurry to withdraw measures or lift off. The demand for credit facilities can be expanded if needed, as Treasury still has plenty of equity. The announcement of these facilities has built confidence in the market and allowed companies to finance themselves privately. The ultimate demand for the facilities is difficult to predict due to the announcement effect.", "'QUESTION': Can the economy have a steady recovery without a vaccine, given the varying measures taken by states to control the virus?\n'ANSWER': Economic forecasts are uncertain due to the dependence on the virus's path and the success of measures taken to control it. The economy will experience a sharp contraction and high unemployment in the second quarter, but as social distancing measures are gradually lifted, the economy will begin to recover. The timing and extent of the recovery are uncertain, and it is important to control the virus to regain confidence and economic activity.", "'QUESTION': Do you worry that this recession is going to fall hardest on marginalized workers who have just started making job gains in the last year or two?\n'ANSWER': Yes, I do worry about that. Unemployment tends to go up faster for minorities and low-income individuals, and it takes longer for them to recover. Just two months ago, we had a strong labor market, especially for these communities. It is heartbreaking to see it threatened now. We need an urgent response to avoid long-term damage and help those who are least able to bear the impact.", "'QUESTION': What lessons are you taking away from the logistical problems of the Paycheck Protection Program for the Main Street lending facilities? Should Republicans be concerned about the amount of fiscal spending in this crisis?\n'ANSWER': The Main Street lending facilities are different from the Paycheck Protection Program as they are loans, not grants, and there won't be a limited pot of money. The Federal Reserve will learn from the PPP and other facilities. While fiscal concerns are important, now is not the time to act on them. We should use the fiscal power to support the economy and address long-term fiscal issues later.", "'QUESTION': Given the amount of stimulus, how much weight does the Federal Reserve give to finding a vaccine for pulling back on their actions and raising rates? Also, when will the Main Street lending facility be deployed?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve cannot rely on a vaccine or therapeutic drug to set their policies. They will continue to provide support until the recovery is well underway. The Main Street lending facility is close to announcing a new term sheet and will be operational soon, with plans to add more products and borrowers. The urgency of the need is understood.", "QUESTION: Can you talk about the path of employment in the coming months and into next year, considering the high unemployment rates predicted by some analysts?\n\nANSWER: Unemployment will increase in the second quarter due to the closure of economic activities during social distancing measures. As these measures are gradually lifted, consumer spending will increase, leading to rehiring and a decrease in unemployment. However, it will take time to reach pre-pandemic employment levels, and the path is uncertain. The focus is on getting the economy on the road to recovery while controlling the disease and minimizing risks. The Federal Reserve will support the economy and the recovery process.", "'QUESTION': What steps do you think we need to take for the economy to make it more resilient to economic shocks?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell asked the reporter to repeat the question as he couldn't hear it clearly.", "'QUESTION': What steps could be taken to make the economy more resilient to exogenous shocks?\n'ANSWER': The shock we are currently facing is unprecedented, and it is too early to assess the answers to this question. However, strengthening banks, improving capital markets, and getting fiscal policy in order are important measures to enhance resilience in the future.", "'QUESTION': Given the demand drop, demand shock, and the drop in oil prices, do you anticipate that we might see any kind of deflation, even for a very short period, that would require a Fed response?

The Federal Reserve is committed to maintaining 2 percent inflation. Low energy prices may temporarily drop headline inflation, but people should focus on core inflation as a better predictor. The concern is that markets are working and assessing risks, as a lack of market function can lead to negative economic outcomes. The measures taken have supported market function and the flow of credit in the economy.", "QUESTION: Are you worried about structural changes in job markets that would keep unemployment high and potentially beyond the ability of the Fed to do anything about? What is your tolerance for loss among the $454 billion from Treasury?\n\nANSWER: The longer one is unemployed, the harder it is to get back into the workforce and recover. We have tools to prevent long-term damage, but we can't limit all of it. The $454 billion is under the authority of the Treasury Secretary and stands in front of our losses. The Treasury Department will determine how to use that money.", "'QUESTION': What would you say to savers who are hurt by low interest rates and may invest in the stock market?\n'ANSWER': Low interest rates have positive effects on the economy, such as making borrowing cheaper and raising asset prices. While savers relying solely on bank savings won't benefit, overall, low interest rates support employment and economic activity. We can't please everyone, but we prioritize the overall good of the economy. As for how long rates will stay low, we're being patient and waiting for the economy to recover before making any changes.", "'QUESTION': Thank you very much.\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell expresses gratitude for the reporter's comment."]}
