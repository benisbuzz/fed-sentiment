Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman .  You just talked about the importance of market conditions reflecting the policy restraint you put in place .  Since the November meeting, the 10- year has declined by 60 basis points, mortgage rates have come down, high- yield credit spreads have come in, the economy \u2019s accelerated, and the stock market \u2019s up 6 percent .  Is this loosening of financial conditions a problem for the Fed in its effort, and its fight , against inflation?   And, if so, do you need to do something about that?   And how would you do something about that?   Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we \u2019re putting in place to bring inflation down to 2 percent .  We thi nk that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year .  But our policy actions work through financial conditions .  And those, in turn, affect economic activity, the labor market, and inflation .  So what we control is our policy moves i n the communications that we make .  Financial conditions both anticipate , and react to , our actions . I would add that our focus is not on short -term moves , but on persistent moves .  And many, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time .  I would say it \u2019s our judgment today that we \u2019re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet, which is why we say that we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate .  And I would point you to the SEP again for our current assessment of what t hat peak level will be.  As you will have seen, 19 people filled out the SEP this time, and 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5 percent or more \u2014in the 5s .  So that \u2019s our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be.     You will also know that, at each subsequent SEP during the course of this year, we \u2019ve actually increased our estimate of what that peak rate will be .  And today we \u2019re\u2014the SEP th at was published shows again that , overwhelmingly , FOMC participants believe that inflation ris ks are to the upside .  So I can \u2019t tell you confidently that we won\u2019 t move up our estimate of the peak rate again at the next SEP .  I don\u2019 t know what we \u2019ll do.  It will depend on future data .  What we\u2019re writing down today is our best estimate of what we think that peak rate will be , based on what we know .  Obviously, if data \u2014if the inflation data come in worse, that could move up .  And it could move down if inflation data are softer.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Jeanna Smialek, New York Tim es.  Thanks for taking our questions .  The SEP, like you mentioned, suggests that the F ed will be making another \u00be percentage points worth of rate increases in 2023 .  I wonder if you would foresee that being in 25 basis point increments, 50 basis point inc rements \u2014sort of how you see the speed playing out going forward.  And then I wonder what you\u2019 re looking at as you determine when to stop\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, as I \u2019ve been saying, as we\u2019 ve gone through the course of this year, as we lifted off and got into t he course of the year and we saw the\u2014 how strong inflation was and how persistent, it was very important to move quickly.  In fact, the speed \u2014the pace with which we \u2019re moving was the most important thing .  I think now that we \u2019re coming to the end of this ye ar, we \u2019ve raised 425 basis points this year , and we \u2019re into restrictive territory . It\u2019s now not so important how fast we go.  It\u2019 s far more important to think , what is the ultimate level?  And then it\u2019 s\u2014at a certain point, the question will become , how long do we remain restrictive ?  That will become the most important question .  But I would say the most important question now is no longer the speed.  So \u2014and that applies to February as well .  So I    think we \u2019ll make the February decision based on the incoming data and where we see financial conditions, where we see the economy.  And that \u2019ll be the key thing, but \u2014I mean, for that decision.  But, ultimately, that question about how high to raise rates is going to be one that we make looking at our progres s on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are , and making an assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough .  [As] I \u2019ve told you today, we have an assessment that we\u2019 re not at a restrictive enough stance, even with today \u2019s move .  And we \u2019ve laid out our own\u2014our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there .  At a certain point, though, we \u2019ll get to that point.  And then the question will be , how long do we stay there ? And there, the strong view on the Committee is that we \u2019ll need to stay there, you know, until we \u2019re really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way.  And we think that that will be some time .  Now, why do I say that?   If you look at \u2014you can break inflation down into three , sort of , buckets .  The first is goods inflation, and we see now, as we \u2019ve been expecting, really , for a year and a half , that supply conditions would get better .  And, ultimately, supply chains get fixed, and demand settles down a little bit and maybe goes back to services a little bit.  And we start to see goods inflation coming down.  We\u2019 re now starting to see that in this report and the last one . Then you go to housing services .  We know the story there is that housing services inflation has been very, very high and will continue to go up, actually.  A s rents expire and have to be renewed, they\u2019 re going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were when the original leases were signed .  But we see that the new leases that are\u2014that the rate for new leases is coming down .  So, once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will    come down sometime next year .  The third piece, which is something like 55 percent of the index, PCE core inflation index, is non- housing- related core services.  And that \u2019s really a function of the labor market, largely.  The biggest cost , by far , in that sector is labor.  And we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven\u2019 t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high.  Vacancies are quite elevated , and, really, there \u2019s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand.  So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down. The other \u2014you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning at all for a year and a half .  Now it seems to be turning .  But there \u2019s an expectation, really, that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we \u2019ll have to stay at it, so that w e may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go .  And that \u2019s really why we are writing down those high rates and why we \u2019re expecting that they \u2019ll have to remain high for a time \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Howard Schneider with Reuters .  Thanks for taking the question.  You describe GDP growth in the SEPs as moderate or modest, I believe .  Yet it \u2019s really approaching stall speed .  Half a percentage point is not much .  You described labor market unemployment rate as represent ing some softening.  But it\u2019 s nearly a full percentage point rise, and that \u2019s well in excess of what has historically been associated with recession .  Why wouldn\u2019 t this be considered a recessionary projection by the F ed\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, I \u2019ll tell you  what the projection is .  I don\u2019 t think it would qualify as a recession, though, because you\u2019 ve got positive growth.  The expectations in the SEP are basically as you said, which is, we \u2019ve got growth at a modest level, which is to say that    \u00bd percentage poi nt, that \u2019s positive growth.  It\u2019 s slow growth.  It\u2019 s well below trend .  It\u2019s not going to feel like a boom .  It\u2019s going to feel like very slow growth, right ? In that condition, labor market conditions are softening a bit .  Unemployment does go up a bit.  I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually elevated at this moment .  So it \u2019s not clear that those forecasts of  inflation are really much above the natural rate of unemployment.  We can never identify its location with great precision .  But that 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market.  If you look \u2014you know, you\u2019 ve got \u2014the reports we get from the field are that companies are very reluctant to lay people off, other than the tech companies, which is, you know, a story unto itself .  Generally , companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it \u2019s been very, very hard to hire .  So you\u2019 ve got all these vacancies out there\u2014 far in excess of the number of employed people .  That doesn \u2019t sound like a \u2014you know, a labor market where a lot of people will need to be put out of work.  So that we \u2014you know, there are channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe.  None of that is guarant eed, but that is what their forecast reflects \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks .  Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, I want to follow up on Jeanna \u2019s question.  The decision to step down the pace of rate increase \u2014rate rises appears to have been socialized at your last meeting, largely before the past two CPI reports showed inflation decelerating in line with the C ommittee \u2019s forecasts this year .  You just now talked about making decisions meeting by meeting and being mindful of the lags of policy .  Does that mean, all things equal, you would feel more comfortable probing where the terminal rate is by moving in 25 basis point increments, including beginning at your next meeting?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I haven\u2019 t made a judgment on wha t size rate hike to make at the last meeting .  But, you know, what you said is broadly right, which is , having moved so quickly and having now so much restraint that \u2019s still in the pipeline, we think that the appropriate thing to do now is to move to a slower pace .  And, you know, that will allow us to feel our way and\u2014you know, and get to that level, we think, and better balance the risks that we face .  So that \u2019s the idea.  It makes a lot of sense, it seems to me\u2014particularly if you consider how far we \u2019ve come .  But, again, I can\u2019 t tell you today what the actual size of that will be .  It will depend on a variety of factors, including the incoming data in particular, the state of the economy, the state of financial conditions . \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  With the CPI report, if it did come out last week, do you think it would have changed some of those forecasts in today\u2019 s estimate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  No .  Absolutely not .  No .  As a \u2014just a matter of practice, the SEP reflects any data that \u2019s\u2014that comes out during the meeting.  And participants know that they have the \u2014they know this \u2014that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, you know, well in advance of the press conference so that we\u2019 re not running around.  But that \u2019s not the case.  It \u2019s never the case that  the SEPs don \u2019t reflect an important piece of data that came in on the first day of the meeting \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thank you for taking our questions .  I\u2019m wondering if we could talk about the projection for the unemployment rate .  Why has the F ed raised its unemployment projection?   Is it because the model suggests that a higher terminal rate would automatically cause a higher unemployment    rate?  Or are you seeing signs that the labor market isn \u2019t quite as strong as we think it is now?   Thanks \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  No .  It\u2019s not about the strength of the labor market.  The labor market is clearly very strong.  It is more just that, you know, by now, we had expected\u2014we \u2019ve continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have, ultimately.  And that \u2019s why the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting.  You see that \u2014you see the fact that we\u2019 ve made less progress than  expected on inflation.  So that \u2019s why that goes up.  And that \u2019s why unemployment goes up, because we\u2019 re having to tighten policy more .  And so it didn\u2019 t go up by much in the meeting, I don\u2019 t think .  But that \u2019s the idea , is slower progress on inflation, ti ghter policy, probably higher rates probably held for longer just to get to where you\u2014the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Do you have a sense of, in order to get to that number, how much of that could be caused by layoffs versus vacancies, trimming, or changes to the labor force population rate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  It\u2019s very hard to say.  You know, there \u2014you can look at history, right ?  And history would, you know, would say that, in a situation like t his, the declines in unemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there .  But why do we think that is the case?  So , I\u2019ll give you a few reasons .  First just is that there \u2019s this huge overhang of vacancies, meaning that va cancies can come down a fair amount .  And we \u2019re hearing from many companies that they don\u2019 t want to lay people off \u2014so that they\u2019 ll keep people because it \u2019s been so hard . I mean, I think we \u2019ve\u2014it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there wher e there  are, you know, 4 million fewer people, a little more than 4 million who were in the    workforce available to work than there \u2019s demand for workforce .  So the fact that there\u2019 s a strong labor market, you know, means that companies will hold on to worke rs.  And it means that it may take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less .  Again, that we\u2019re going to find out empirically .  But I think that \u2019s a reasonably possible outcome.  And you do hear, you know, many, many labor economists believe that it is .  So we \u2019ll see, though\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times .  How should we interpret the higher core inflation forecast for 2023 in the SEP?   Does that not then suggest that the policy rate currently forecasted for next year should actually be higher than the 5.1 medi an estimate penciled in?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, I think that\u2019 s why one of the reasons it went up was that core came in stronger thi s year .  Yeah .  What you see is our best estimate, as of today\u2014really, as of today\u2014for how high we need to raise rates to\u2014 how much we need to tighten policy to create enough, you know, restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow \u2014soften the labor market and bring inflation down through those channels .  That \u2019s all\u2014that is the estimate \u2014best estimate\u2014we make today.  And, as I mentioned, we \u2019ll make another estimate for the next SEP .

I wanted to make sure I understand specifically what \u2019s going on in the SEP , because you all expect rates to go higher, but you\u2019re also more pessim istic about what inflation is going to look like next year .  And I was just    wondering, you know, given that we have seen some cooling in inflation, you know, is it \u2014is that primarily because of wage growth, that you expect wage growth to be sort of a headwi nd\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  We\u2019 re going into next year with higher inflation than we had thought, right ?  So we\u2019re actually moving down to\u2014the level that we \u2019re moving down to next year is still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now, well more than 1 percent change in inflation .  But remember that the jump [ing]- off point at the beginning of the year is higher .  So, you know, we \u2014we \u2019re moving down still by a very large chunk.  I don \u2019t think it\u2019s having \u2014I don\u2019 t think the policy is having any less effect .  It\u2019s just starting from a higher level at the end of 2022.  So we \u2019re getting down.  I believe the median is 3 \u00bd percent .  That would be \u2014that \u2019s a pretty significant drop in inflation . And, you know, where \u2019s it coming from?   It\u2019s coming from the goods sector, clearly.  By the middle of next year, we should begin to see lower inflation from the housing services sector .  And then, you know, the big question is, when we \u2014how much will you see from the largest, the 55 percent of the index, which is the non- housing services sector ?  And, you know, that \u2019s where you need to see \u2014we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in t he labor market so that you have \u2014it\u2019s not that we don\u2019 t want wage increases.  We want strong wage increases.  We just want them to be at a level that \u2019s consistent with 2 percent inflation .

Hi, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios .  Some of your colleag ues have been pretty explicit that they can \u2019t imagine rate cuts happening in 2023.

What \u2019s your view of the likelihood of any kind of r ate cuts next year?  What circumstances might make that plausible?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance to one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time .  It\u2019s not on rate cuts.  And we think that we \u2019ll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time .  Historical experience caution s strongly against prematurely loosening policy .  I guess I would say it this way:  I wouldn\u2019 t see us considering rate cu ts until the Committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent in a sustained way.

Let me ask you about China .  In the last few weeks, China has abandoned its COVID policy and been reopening pretty strongly.  I\u2019m wondering if you see that as disinflationary because you\u2019 re seeing supply chains improve or inflationary because it obviously brings a lot more demand globally, improves the  global outlook for growth and for commodities prices . \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So you\u2019 re right .  Those two things will offset each other .  Weaker output in China will push down on commodity prices, but it could interfere with supply chains ultimately .

And it doesn \u2019t seem likely, actually, that the overall ne t effect would be material on us .  But, to your point, China faces a very challenging situation in reopening.

Are you still worried it could slip into some kind of unentrenched, you know, upward spiral?   Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Right .  So the data that we\u2019 ve received so far for October and November, we don\u2019 t have the \u2014some of the \u2014we have some remaining data to get in November, but they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases .  As I mentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained down ward path.  So the way we think about this is this:  This report is very much in line with what we \u2019ve been expecting and hoping for .  And what it does is , it provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation . As I mentioned, we \u2019ve been expecting significant \u2014forecasting significant declines in overall inflation and core inflation in the coming year .  And this is the kind of reading that it will take to support that .  So, really, this gives us greater confidence in our forecasts rather than , at this point , changing our forecast .  In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting goods inflation to come down as supply chain pressures eased .  That\u2019s happening now .  Housing services \u2014as I    mentioned, there \u2019s good news in the pipeline .  As long as hous ing\u2014new housing leases show declining inflation, that will show up in the measure around the middle of next year .  So that should help.  And the big piece, again, is core services, ex  housing, which is very important .  And we have a ways to go there .  You do see some beginning signs there . But, ultimately, that \u2019s the big \u2014the more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE core index .  And it \u2019s very fundamentally about the labor market and wages .  If you look at wages, look at the average hourly earnings number w e got with the last payrolls report, you don\u2019 t really see much progress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down.  Now, there may be composition effects and other effects in that.  So we don\u2019 t put too much weight on any one report .  These things can be volatile month to month.  But we will be looking for wages moving, you know, down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and, ultimately, their gains are not being eaten up by inflation\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  The re\u2019s a\u2014excuse me, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  There \u2019s a little bit of a disconnect between the optimistic view you just expressed about the economy and the changes that you\u2019 ve made in the SEP .  And I \u2019m wondering if you\u2019 re reacting t o the fact that the markets have loosened financial conditions or if you feel the Fed may be a little bit behind on inflation, whether the recent disinflation we \u2019re seeing is transitory or not , and how this affects the idea of a soft landing if you\u2019 re projecting just \u00bd percent growth for this year.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So if I\u2014I think I got your question.  So, you know, one thing is to say is, I think our polic y\u2019s in\u2014getting into a pretty good place now .  We\u2019 re restrictive, and I think we \u2019re\u2014you know, we \u2019re getting close to that level of sufficient\u2014 we think\u2014sufficiently    restrictive .  We laid out today what our best estimates are to get there .  And, I mean, it boils down to, how long do we think this process is going to take?  And, of course, we \u2019re\u2014we welcome these better inflation reports for the last two months .  They \u2019re very welcome .  But I think we \u2019re realistic about the broader project .  So that \u2019s all.  That\u2019s the point I would make . It\u2019s\u2014you know, we see goods prices coming down.  We understand what will happen with housing services .  But the big story will really be the rest of it, and there \u2019s not much progress there .  And that \u2019s going to take some time .  I think my view and my colleagues \u2019 view is that this will take some time .  We \u2019ll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained period so that, you know, two good\u2014you know, two good monthly reports are, you know, very welcome.  Of course, they\u2019 re very welcome .  But we need to be honest with ourselves that there \u2019s, you know, inflation\u201412- month core inflation is 6 percent CPI .  That \u2019s three times our 2 percent target .  Now, it \u2019s good to see progress .  But let \u2019s just understand we have a long ways to go to get back to price stability.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Well, do you think the soft landing is no longer achievable?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  No, I wouldn\u2019 t say that .  No .  I don\u2019 t say that .  I mean, I would say this:  You know, to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation, you know, moves up higher and higher, I think that narrows the runway.  But lower inflation readings, if they persist, in time, could certainly make it more possible .  So I just \u2014I don\u2019t think anyone knows whether we \u2019re going to have a recession or not and, if we do, whether it\u2019s going to be a deep one  or not .  It\u2019s just , it\u2019s not knowable .  And certainly, you know, lower inflation reports, were they to continue for a period of time, would increase the likelihood of a \u2014put it this way, of a return to price stability that involves significantly less of an  increase in unemployment than would be expected given the historical record.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Ch eung, NBC News .  You warned Americans of pain earlier this year as the F ed hikes rates .  But with the Fed now  expected to raise rates higher than you thought when you first said that, just wondering where we are in that pain.  How would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves \u2014that \u2019d be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So the largest amount of pain \u2014the worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high  in terms of employment, meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time, the kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the F ed didn\u2019 t respond aggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode, you know, 50 years ago.  So that \u2019s really \u2014the worst pain would be if we failed to act . What we\u2019 re doing now is, you know, it \u2019s raising interest rates for people .  And so people are paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing.  There will be some softening in labor market conditions .  And I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability .  There isn \u2019t.  And this is the best we can do .  I do think, though, that \u2014and markets are pretty confident, it seems to me \u2014that we will get in flation under control .  And I believe we will.  We\u2019re certainly highly committed to do that \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr . Chair .  Grady Trimble with Fox Business .  You \u2019ve reiterated today and the Committee has reiterated its commitment to that 2 percent inflation    target.  I wonder, is there ever a point where you actually reevaluate that target and maybe increase your inflation target if it is stickier than even you think it is?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  That \u2019s just \u2014so , changing our inflation goal is just something we \u2019re not thinking about, and it \u2019s something we \u2019re not going to think about .  It\u2019s\u2014we have a 2 percent inflation goal, and we \u2019ll use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent .  I think this isn \u2019t the time to be thinking about that .  I mean, there may be a longer -run project at some point.  But that is not where we are at all .  The Committee \u2014we \u2019re not considering that .  We \u2019re not going to consider that under any circumstances .  We\u2019 re going to keep our inflation target at 2 percent .

As you monitor wage growth and unemployment data, I wonder if you \u2019re paying close attention to a sector or even income level?  Like, how do you factor potential exacerbations of inequality into your risk calculations, especially given the K -shaped recovery of 2020?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So the \u2014I would go back to the labor market that we had in 2018, \u201919, \u201920.  So , what that looked like was , wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the income spectrum were the largest .  The gaps between racial groups and gender groups were at their smallest in reco rded history .  That \u2019s\u2014and all of that because of a tight labor market, a tight labor market which had inflation running, you know, just a tick below 2 percent and the economy growing right at its potential . So that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the country, if we could get back to that .  And so that \u2019s what all of us want to do.  We want to get back to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of    time.  That \u2019s a really good thing for workers in the economy.  And we \u2019d love to get back to that .  That\u2019s what our goal is .  You know, there \u2019s\u2014in the near term, we have to use our tools to restore price stability .  But we , you know, we can\u2019 t\u2014what we have to think about is the medium and longer term . If you think about it, the country went through a difficult time \u2014I think much more difficult than we can think it would happen here .  But it really set up our economy for several decades of prosperity .  So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of the economy and the people in it over a very, very long period of time .  And so when it is lost, for whatever reason, it has to be restored and as quickly as possible\u2014wh ich is what we\u2019 re doing.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: In the short  term, are you factoring in these exacerbations or potential exacerbations in the economy?

What would you do if the economy slows so much that we enter a recession before we see strong consistent signs that inflation is slowing\u2014in other words, stagflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I don\u2019 t want to get into too many hypotheticals .  But, you know, we\u2019ll\u2014it\u2019s hard to deal with  hypotheticals .  So let me just say that we have to use our tools to support maximum employment and price stability .  I\u2019ve made it clear that right now, the labor market\u2019 s very, very strong.  You\u2019re  near a 50 -year low where you\u2019 re at or above maximum emplo yment , a 50-year low in unemployment, vacancies are very high, wages \u2014nominal wages    are very high.  So the labor market \u2019s very, very strong.  Where we\u2019 re missing is on the inflation side.  And we \u2019re missing by a lot on the inflation side .  So that means we need to really focus on getting inflation under control, and that \u2019s what we\u2019 ll do.  I think, as the economy heals, the two goals come more into play.  But right now, clearly, the focus has to be on getting inflation down\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chairman Powell .  Greg Robb from MarketWatch .  You spoke a little bit ago.  You said that the U .S. looks \u2014it looks like we have a structural labor shortage in the economy.  Could you expand on that , talk a little bit more about that?   And, really, are you talking about getting Congress action on increasing, like, legal immigration, things like that?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, what I meant by that, with \u201c structural labor shortage ,\u201d is, if you look at where we are now, as I mentioned , there \u2014if you just look at demand for labor, you can look at vacancies plus people who are actually working.  And then you can take supply of labor by, \u201cA re you in the labor market? \u201d  \u201cAre you looking for a job or have a job? \u201d  And you\u2019 re 4\u2014more than 4 million people short .  We don\u2019 t see\u2014 despite very high wages and an incredibly tight labor market, we don\u2019 t see participation moving up \u2014which is contrary to what we thought . So the upshot of all that is , the labor market is actually \u2014it should \u2014it\u2019s 3\u00bd million people , at least , smaller than it should have been based on pre -pandemic .  Just assume population and reasonable growth and aging of the population;  our labor force should be 3\u00bd million more than it is .  And that \u2014there\u2019re lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back a few more years.  So why is that?   Part of it is just accelerated retirements .  People dropped out and aren \u2019t coming back at a higher rate than expected .  Part of it is that we lost a half a million    people who would have been work\u2014close to half a million who would have been working died from COVID .  And part of it is that migration has been lower . We don\u2019 t prescribe\u2014you know, it \u2019s not our job to prescribe things .  But, you know, I think if you ask businesses, you know, pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren\u2019 t enough people .  We need more people .

They raised the policy interest rate by \u00c2\u00bd percentage point and anticipate further increases to achieve their goal of returning inflation to 2 percent.The Federal Reserve is continuing to reduce the size of its balance sheet, and restoring price stability will require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The US economy has slowed significantly from last year, with growth in consumer spending and activity in the housing sector weakening due to lower real disposable income, tighter financial conditions, and higher mortgage rates.The FOMC projects slow GDP growth below the normal rate, but the labor market remains tight with low unemployment, high job vacancies, and elevated wage growth. Despite a slowdown in job gains, the labor market is imbalanced with demand exceeding the supply of workers.The inflation data for October and November show a reduction in price increases, but more evidence is needed to confirm a sustained downward trend. Price pressures are still present across various goods and services, with Russia's war against Ukraine contributing to inflation. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term expectations remain anchored, but there is a risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched if it continues. The Fed is focused on promoting maximum employment and stable prices, recognizing the hardship high inflation brings to those with limited purchasing power. They are committed to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the federal funds rate by \u00c2\u00bd percentage point, bringing it to a range of 4 \u00c2\u00bc to 4\u00c2\u00bd percent, and they are continuing to reduce the size of their balance sheet. They anticipate further increases in interest rates to achieve a restrictive monetary policy and return inflation to 2 percent, although the effects may take time to be fully realized.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projects an increase in the federal funds rate to 5.1 percent by the end of next year, higher than previously projected. However, these projections are not set in stone, as decisions will be based on incoming data and their impact on the economy, with the goal of reducing inflation and achieving long-term stability.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to continuing their efforts until their objectives are met, acknowledging the impact of their actions on various stakeholders. They emphasize their dedication to their public mission and assure that they will do everything possible to achieve their employment and price stability goals.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Is the loosening of financial conditions a problem for the Fed in its fight against inflation and what can be done about it?\n'ANSWER': Financial conditions need to reflect the policy restraint in place to bring inflation down. While conditions have tightened, our policy actions work through financial conditions, which in turn affect economic activity, the labor market, and inflation. Our focus is on persistent moves, and we believe ongoing rate hikes are appropriate. The peak rate is estimated to be 5 percent or more, and future adjustments will depend on data.", "'QUESTION': How do you foresee the rate increases in 2023 and what factors will determine when to stop?\n'ANSWER': The speed of rate increases was important earlier this year, but now that we're in restrictive territory, the pace is less important. The ultimate level of rates and how long we remain restrictive will be the key questions. We'll make decisions based on incoming data, financial conditions, and our assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough. We expect inflation to come down over time, but services inflation may take longer, so rates may need to remain high for a while.", "'QUESTION': Why wouldn't this be considered a recessionary projection by the Fed?\n'ANSWER': The projection is not considered a recession because there is positive growth, even though it is slow and below trend. Labor market conditions are softening, but unemployment is still relatively low. Companies are reluctant to lay off workers and there are more job vacancies than employed people, indicating that the labor market can come back into balance with modest increases in unemployment.", "QUESTION: Does the Federal Reserve plan to probe the terminal rate by moving in 25 basis point increments, including at the next meeting?\n\nANSWER: Chair Powell has not made a decision on the size of the rate hike at the last meeting. However, considering the quick pace of previous rate increases and the existing restraint in the economy, the plan is to move at a slower pace to better balance risks and reach the desired level. The actual size of the rate hike will depend on various factors, including incoming data and the state of the economy and financial conditions.", "'QUESTION': Would the CPI report from last week have affected the forecasts in today's estimate?\n'ANSWER': No, the SEP already incorporates any data that comes out during the meeting. Participants have the opportunity to make changes to their SEP before the press conference, so important data from the first day of the meeting is always reflected in the SEPs.", "'QUESTION': Why has the Fed raised its unemployment projection?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has raised its unemployment projection not because of a weak labor market, but because they have not made as much progress on inflation as expected. This requires tighter policy and possibly higher rates for longer in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': Do you have a sense of how much of the decline in unemployment is due to layoffs versus vacancies or changes in the labor force population rate?\n'ANSWER': It's difficult to determine, but historical data suggests that declines in unemployment are more significant than what is currently reported. There is a large number of job vacancies, and many companies are reluctant to lay off workers due to a perceived labor shortage. This could result in a longer recovery period and potentially lower unemployment costs. However, this is a hypothesis that will need to be tested empirically.", "'QUESTION': How should we interpret the higher core inflation forecast for 2023 in the SEP?\n'ANSWER': The higher core inflation forecast for 2023 is due to stronger core inflation this year. The forecast represents the best estimate as of today for how much rates need to be raised and policy tightened to slow economic activity, soften the labor market, and bring down inflation. Another estimate will be made for the next SEP.", "'QUESTION': Given the cooling in inflation, is it primarily because of wage growth?\n'ANSWER': We are expecting a significant drop in inflation next year, but it is starting from a higher level. The drop is mainly coming from the goods sector, and we hope to see lower inflation from the housing services sector as well. The key is to achieve a better balance of supply and demand in the labor market to have wage increases consistent with 2 percent inflation.", "'QUESTION': What is Chair Powell's view on the likelihood of rate cuts next year and what circumstances might make them plausible?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell's focus is on moving policy to ensure a return of inflation to the 2 percent goal, not on rate cuts. He believes a restrictive policy stance will need to be maintained for some time, as historical experience warns against prematurely loosening policy. Rate cuts would only be considered when the Committee is confident that inflation is sustainably moving down to 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': Do you see China's reopening as disinflationary or inflationary?\n'ANSWER': The reopening of China could have offsetting effects on inflation. Weaker output in China may push down commodity prices, but disruptions in supply chains could push inflation up in the West. It is difficult to determine the net effect, but it is unlikely to have a significant impact overall. China's reopening is risky due to potential increases in COVID cases.", "QUESTION: Can you comment on the recent inflation report and whether you are confident in getting inflation under control?\n\nANSWER: The recent data for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. However, we need more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path. This report aligns with our expectations and gives us greater confidence in our forecasts, but we still have a ways to go, particularly in core services and wages.", "QUESTION: Are the changes made in the SEP a reaction to loosened financial conditions or the Fed being behind on inflation, and how does this affect the idea of a soft landing with projected low growth?\n\nANSWER: The policy is in a good place now and getting close to being sufficiently restrictive. While the recent better inflation reports are welcome, there is still a long way to go to achieve price stability. The rest of the inflation progress will take time, and policy needs to be held at a restrictive level for a sustained period.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the soft landing is no longer achievable?\n'ANSWER': No, I wouldn't say that. To the extent that rates need to be kept higher and inflation rises, it narrows the runway. However, if lower inflation persists, it could make a soft landing more possible. It's impossible to know if there will be a recession or how severe it will be. Continued lower inflation reports could increase the likelihood of a return to price stability with less impact on unemployment.", "'QUESTION': How would you describe the pain to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves with 1.6 million Americans out of jobs?\n'ANSWER': The worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and allowing inflation to become entrenched. The cost of getting inflation out of the economy would be very high in terms of employment. Raising interest rates will lead to higher rates on mortgages and some softening in labor market conditions, but it is necessary to restore price stability. The Fed is committed to getting inflation under control.", "'QUESTION': Is there a possibility of reevaluating and increasing the inflation target if it proves to be stickier than anticipated?\n'ANSWER': We are not considering changing our inflation goal and have no plans to do so. Our commitment is to maintain a 2 percent inflation target and we will use our tools to achieve that goal. While there may be discussions in the future, it is not something we are currently considering.", "'QUESTION': Are you paying attention to a specific sector or income level in relation to wage growth and unemployment data, and how do you consider inequality in your risk calculations?\n'ANSWER': In the past, a tight labor market led to wage increases for low-income workers and reduced gaps between racial and gender groups. We aim to return to that scenario for a strong and extended period of time. While we focus on restoring price stability in the near term, we also consider the long-term benefits of price stability for the economy and its people.", "'QUESTION': Are you factoring in short-term exacerbations in the economy and monitoring them?\n'ANSWER': Yes, we do. It is our regular practice to monitor unemployment rates among different groups, including racial groups. We keep our eye on these factors.", "'QUESTION': What would the Federal Reserve do if the economy enters a recession before signs of inflation slowing down?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve Chair, Powell, states that he does not want to speculate on hypothetical situations. However, he emphasizes the need to use tools to support maximum employment and price stability. While the labor market is strong, inflation is a concern, and the focus is on getting inflation under control.", "QUESTION: Could you expand on the structural labor shortage in the US economy and whether Congress should take action on increasing legal immigration?\n\nANSWER: The labor market is currently 3\u00c2\u00bd million people smaller than it should be based on pre-pandemic levels. Factors contributing to this shortage include accelerated retirements, COVID-related deaths, and lower migration. While the Federal Reserve does not prescribe solutions, businesses consistently express the need for more people. It is Congress' responsibility to address this issue.", "'QUESTION': Have you discussed how long and/or how deep of a recession you would be willing to accept?\n'ANSWER': No, we make quarterly forecasts that show slow growth, a softening labor market, and decreasing inflation. We don't talk about specific types of recessions, but we do explore different scenarios in alternative simulations. However, we haven't asked ourselves that question.", "'QUESTION': If inflation starts to decline materially, would the real rate become more restrictive and is that something the FOMC would want to see?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC would not cut rates until they are confident that inflation is consistently decreasing. They do not have a precise understanding of the neutral rate and real rates, so it would not happen mechanically. Cutting rates would depend on their confidence in sustained inflation reduction."]}
