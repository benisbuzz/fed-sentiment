Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times .  Per your statement here, I guess the question is, is there any reason to believe that a 25 basis point cut is going to be sufficient to expediently return inflation to your 2 percent target ?  And, if not,    what are you going to be looking at to convince y ou that you need to cut rates again?  What is the hurdle rate there?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I think you have to look at not just the 25 ba sis point cut, but look at the C ommittee \u2019s actions over the course of the year .  As I noted in my opening statement, we started off expecting some rate increases , we moved to a patient setting for a few months, and now we \u2019ve moved here .  I think what you \u2019ve seen over the course of the year is , as we \u2019ve moved to a more accommodative policy, the economy has actually performed ju st about as expected with that gradually increasing support .  And I think\u2014 I wouldn\u2019 t take credit for all of that, but I do think that increasing policy support  has kept the economy on track and kept the outlook favorable . In terms of the rest of your quest ion, the C ommittee is really thinking of this as a way of adjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I mentioned:   to insure against downside risks, to provide support to the economy , that  those factors are \u2014where factors are pushing down on economic growth, and then to support inflation.  So we do think it will serve all of those goals, but again, we \u2019re thinking of it as essentially in the nature of a midcycle adjustment to policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  There\u2019 s a perception out there  that perhaps , in this case , the F ed is something of a hammer in search of a nail, because the latest consumer spending reports, as you suggested, don\u2019 t seem to show any kind of demand problem in the U.S.  A nd when you look at mortgage rates, auto lending rates, they\u2019ve all come down .  And so, wondering exactly what problem lower capital costs will solve.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, you\u2019 re absolutely right .  The \u2014the  performance  of the economy has been reasonably good.  The position of the economy is as close to our objectives as it \u2019s been    in a long time, and the outlook is also good.  What we\u2019 ve been monitoring since the beginning of the year is , effectively , downside risks to t hat outlook from weakening global growth, and we see that everywhere:   weak manufacturing, weak global growth now , particularly in the European Union and China .  In addition, we see trade policy developments, which at times have been disruptive and then ha ve been less so, and also inflation running below target .  So we see those as threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook, and we see this action as designed to support them and keep that outlook favorable .  And , frankly, it is a continuation of what we \u2019ve been doing all year to provide more support against those very same risks\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  But the follow -up question is, how does it  do that?  How does cutting interest rates lower \u2014or, how does cutting interest rates keep that going , since the cost of  capital doesn \u2019t seem to be the issue here?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, I \u2014I really think it does , and I think the evidence of my eyes tells me that our policy does support \u2014it supports confidence, it supports economic activity, household and business confidence, and through channels that we understand.  So it will lower borrowing costs .  It will\u2014and it will work .  And I think you see it .  Since\u2014 you know, since we noted our vigilance about the situation in June, you saw financial conditions move up, and you saw\u2014I won \u2019t take credit for the whole recovery, but you saw financial conditions move up.  You see confidence, which had troughed in June \u2014you saw it move back up.  You see economic activity on a healthy basis .  It just\u2014it seems to work through confide nce channels as well as the mechanical channels that you are talking about.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Heather Long from t he Washington Post .  You always say that the F ed is data dependent, and much of the data that we \u2019ve seen since the June meeting has surprised to the upside or at least been in line with expectations .  Can you give us a sense of how    that better -than-expected data impacted the FOMC \u2019s thinking ?  And if we keep seeing these upside surprises, does that change or evolve any FOMC thinking going forward?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, yes .  I mean , I think we \u2014of course, you know, what we do at every meeting, as I noted, is , we do a deep dive into U.S . economic activity and global activity and, certainly , carefully went through U.S . economic activity, which there has  been some positive and some negative, but , overall , the U.S . economy has shown resilience during the intermeeting period.  But, again, the \u2014the  issue is more the downside risks and then the shortfall in inflation, and we \u2019re trying to address those . So, in addition, going forward, I would say, we \u2019re going to be monitoring those same things .  We \u2019ll be monitoring the evolution of trade uncertainty, of global growth, and of low inflation .  And we \u2019ll also, of course, be watching the performance of the U.S . econo my.  As I mentioned, it had shown some resilience here to those issues, and we \u2019ll be putting all of that together , and that \u2019s how we \u2019ll be thinking about policy going forward.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Steve Liesman , CNBC .  I just want to follow up on that .  Would you say we \u2019re sort of\u2014 you guys have gotten into a new regime here?  This is sort of an insurance cut and not a data -dependent cut ?  And are we now more in the realm of watching headlines of trade talks than we are watching unemployment rate and inflation numbers , or\u2014and growth numbers?  What \u2014how do we know what you\u2019 re going to do next , and why now in this new regime?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Ye s.  So I gave three reasons for what we did, and that is to i nsure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions .  So that is \u2014in a sense, that is a risk -management point, and that is a bit of insurance .  But we also feel like weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S . economy .  You see it    now in the second quarter :  You see weak investment , you see weak manufacturing \u2014so support demand there  and also to support return of inflation to  2 percent .  But there \u2019s definitely an insurance aspect of it . Trade is unusual .  We don \u2019t\u2014you know, the thing is, there isn\u2019 t a lot of  experience in responding to global trade tensions .  So it is a \u2014it\u2019 s something that we haven\u2019 t faced before and that we \u2019re learning by doing .  And it is not \u2014it\u2019 s not exactly the same as watching global growth , where you see growth weakening, you see central banks and governments responding with fiscal policy, and you see growth strengthening, and you see a business cycle .  With trade tensions \u2014which do seem to be having a significant effect on financial market conditions and on the economy \u2014they evolve in a different way, and we have to follow them . And, by the way, I want to be clear here.  We play no role whatsoever in assessing or evaluating trade policies other than as \u2014as trade policy uncertainty has an effect on the U.S . economy in the short and medium te rm.  We \u2019re not in any way criticizing trade policy .  That \u2019s really not our job.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal .  So, Chair Powell, you and your colleagues have offered three reasons to cut rates :  a lower neutral rate that may have made policy a little bit tighter than anticipated, the global slowdown and the darker  risk picture from the trade tensions, and this desire to re -center inflation and inflation expectations .  I wonder, which of those fac tors, if any, weighs most heavily on you?  A nd, more importantly, is a \u00bc point cut really going to address all of that, let alone any one of those?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I actually think different people have different \u2014different  weightings has been my experien ce on those things .  You mentioned lower r* , trade slowdown\u2014and I would actually add,  lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down, all of which    kind of point to more accommodation.  So, again, I don \u2019t think asking about a \u00bc point is really the ri ght question.  I think you have to look back over the course of the year and see the Committee moving away from rate increases to a neutral posture to , now , a rate cut . So I think we \u2019ve been providing \u2014and that a ffects the forward rate path, and it affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy .  You see an economy which is actually performing pretty well .  Growth in the first half of this year is about the same as it was in all of \u2019 18 and actually a little better than our forecast  for growth in 2019 \u2014at the end of 2019.  So I think, in a way , that \u2019s monetary policy working .  And , again, I wouldn \u2019t just look at the 25 basis point cut as the right question\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  If I could follow up, I guess in May \u2014in May  it seemed as if you were setting a higher bar to cut rates :  There would need to be a deterioration i n the outlook.  In June, you seemed to suggest that if the outlook didn\u2019 t improve, there might be a rate cut .  Where is that bar right now , because I think there \u2019s some co nfusion about how the C ommittee is responding.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Ye s.  So we, as we noted \u2014we noted at the bottom of the statement that language, which really says how we \u2019re thinking about it .  So it says , as we\u2019re contemplating the future path of the target r ange for the federal funds rate, we \u2019ll continue to monitor the implications of incoming information \u2014and it talks  about that language .  So, you know, I can \u2019t\u2014all I can tell you is, we \u2019ll be looking at weak global growth.  We \u2019ll be looking very carefully to see how that \u2019s happening. And I think you see \u2014you learn \u2014every cycle you learn about these things .  So we will see whether growth is picking up, whether it \u2019s bottoming out .  We \u2019ll see that picture .  We \u2019ll also see on trade.  Y ou know, we \u2019re going to be seeing \u2014I think we \u2019ve learned a lot on trade in this    cycle .  I think we \u2019ll continue to learn more , and on inflation we will .  So, in addition, the U.S . economy itself is \u2014the performance of the U.S . economy will enter into that .  So I would love to be more p recise, but with trade , it is a factor that we have to assess in kind of a new way .  Those are the things that we \u2019ll be looking at, and\u2014 you know, in  making our decisions going forward.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Edward Lawrence with Fox Business Network.  So a rate hike last December was seen by some economists and the St. Louis F ed president, James Bullard, as a step too far.  Now the F ed\u2019s waited about seven months for a rate cut .  You said today you were concerned about downside risks .  So could some of the weakn ess on the business side , with that fixed investment and the sluggish side on the business side , be because the F ed waited so long ?  I want to get your thoughts on that  and talk about why you feel that this nudge is the right level.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Ye s.  So we don\u2019 t hear that from businesses .  They don\u2019 t come in and say, \u201cWe\u2019re not investing because, you know, the federal funds rate is too high.\u201d   I haven \u2019t heard that from a business .  What you hear is that demand is weak for their products .  You see manufacturing being weak all over the world.  Investment \u2014business investment is weak.  A nd I wouldn\u2019 t lay all of that at the door of trade talks .  I think there \u2019s a\u2014there\u2019s a  global business cycle happening with manufacturing and investment, and that \u2019s\u2014tha t\u2019s been, you know, definitely a bigger factor than , certainly , we expected late last year .  I think global \u2014global  growth started to slow down in the middle of last year, but that has gone on to a greater extent .  And, by the way, trade policy uncertainty has also been, I think, more elevated than we antic ipated.  In terms of , is this the \u2014we believe this is the right move for today, and we think it\u2019 s\u2014we think it will serve the three ends that I mentioned .

Are there any circumstances under which you would decide to pause \u2014pause  at one interest rate cut, today \u2019s interest rate cut , and not \u2014not , not go ahead with further monetary easing at this stage ?  Or are you predicting that, you know, once you\u2019 ve embarked on this easing , you will have to at least move by one more notch going f orward?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, so our policy is \u2014will depend on the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook as well as evolving risks to that outlook.  A nd so we \u2019re going to be monitoring the implications of incoming information for the out look, as I mentioned.  And, s o I\u2014that \u2019s really where I would leave you with that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Victoria Guida with Politico .  On capital, Vice Chairman Quarles has said that the level of capital requirements that exist s right now are such that it\u2019 s basically like the counter cyclical capital buffer is already turned on , and that he would like the ability to be able to turn it down in a downturn.  I was wondering if you agreed with that .    And then, also, just quickly , on real -time payments \u2014larger banks have suggested that if the F ed built its own system , that would be  a bait -and-switch , because the F ed asked \u2014or called for a private -sector system .  Do you think that that is a fair assessment?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Okay .  So, on the first, I would say that I view the level of capital requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right .  I do agree with that .  The idea that you \u2019re talking about is one that \u2019s\u2014that Vice Chair Quarles has talked about .  It\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s one under consideration.  The idea being , in a sense , we\u2019ve chosen, in the United States, to have high through -the-cycle capital requirements by doubling the SIFI  surcharge, which is the surcharge that the largest banks have in their capital requirem ents.  We \u2019ve, in effect , already put in place substantial countercyclical buffers .  And so, conceptually , you can think of \u2014I\u2019m not saying it\u2019 s the same thing as a countercyclical capital buffer . So that \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s really the point \u2014is that we don\u2019 t rely \u2014our s ystem doesn \u2019t rely on our ability \u2014it doesn\u2019 t mainly rely on our ability to identify the right time in the cycle to trigger a countercyclical tool .  We rely on through- the-cycle, always -on high capital and liquidity requirements .  And I think that \u2019s a good thing to do.  The idea of putting it in place so you can cut it, that\u2019 s something some other jurisdictions have done, and it \u2019s worth considering .  I think the United Kingdom , in particular , has a  countercyclical capital buffer that\u2019 s always on , but the one point of it is that you can cut when there \u2019s a downturn and therefore give the banks more room .  So this isn \u2019t something we \u2019ve decided to do.  It\u2019s just under consideration. In terms of the real -time payment system, your second question, so this is something we\u2014the United States is far behind other countries in terms of having real -time payments available to the general public.  The F ed, really, coming out of the Reserve System \u2014the Reserve Banks and the Board together \u2014convened all of the stakeh olders around the table to talk about    how we can move forward.  This is consumer groups, technology companies, banks, card companies \u2014pretty much all of the groups who would be interested\u2014and worked on a project for several years .  And one of the things tha t came out of that  was a recommendation that the Fed should build a 24 x  7 x 365 real-time settlement system to solve that problem\u2014to address that problem . We put out a proposal in October of last year about, you know, should we do this, and we got quite a  lot of comments .  They were overwhelmingly favorable .  And I would point out that in our payment system, in many places, the F ed operates alongside private -sector operators \u2014for example, in wholesale payments , in ACH, and in check\u2014so it wouldn\u2019 t be unusual  or out of keeping with \u2014with  how we \u2019ve done things in the past .  We have not made a decision on this, but it \u2019s something we \u2019re looking at carefully and something I do expect we \u2019ll make a decision on soon\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Craig Torres from Bloomberg .  I\u2019m trying to parse what you \u2019re saying here .  On the one hand, you say the policy tilt in the statement has eased financial conditions , and that \u2019s helping the economy .  In that tilt, market participants are interpreting this language , \u201cwill act as appropriate ,\u201d as still being in the statement.  And , on the other hand, you say it \u2019s not the start of a \u2014of an easing cycle.  So what are you saying?  Does that mean, you know, with one or two more cuts you\u2019 ll be done, and this policy bias comes out of the statement ?  Or simply that this policy bias will come out of the statement sooner than market participants think?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So it is \u2014as I mentioned, it \u2019s going to depend on the evolving data and the evolving risk picture .  But as we look at the situation now and the outlook now, what we see is that it\u2019 s appropriate to make an adjustment in policy to a somewhat more accommodative    stance.  That \u2019s what we \u2019re seeing .  And that \u2019s what we \u2019re going to be looking \u2014you know, we \u2019ll be looking at incoming data, at all of the \u2014at the risks that I mentioned , and the performance of the U.S . economy , and at low  inflation .

Can you elaborate a little bit on how this rate cut is expected to help them?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, I think the best thing for people who are \u2014who a re feeling that\u2014and we are getting lots of feedback from people who work and live in low - and moderate -income communities to the effect that they \u2019re now feeling the recovery , and, in fact , they haven\u2019 t felt a better labor market in anybody \u2019s memory , so this is great to hear .  And I guess my view is , the best thing we can do for those people is to sustain the expansion, keep it going, and that \u2019s one of the overarching goals of \u2014of this move and all of our policy moves .  There really is no reason why the expan sion can \u2019t keep going .  Inflation is not troublingly high.  If you look at the \u2014at the U.S. economy right now, there \u2019s no sector that \u2019s booming and therefore might bust .  You have a fairly well -balanced, in a sense, economy . Now, the engine , though,  is real ly a consumer economy, which is 70 percent of the economy .  The manufacturing economy \u2014the investment and manufacturing part of the economy \u2014is more or less not \u2014not  growing much .  It\u2019s at a healthy level but not growing much .  So\u2014and we hope to help that with this rate cut.

And, you know, just to touch on that again, this action is designed to i nsure against downside risks to the out look from weak global growth and trade tensions, offset the negative effect that those factors are already having, and promote a faster return  of inflation to  2 percent.  That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about all year long, and we\u2019ve gradually moved our pol icy in the direction of more accommodation.  I think what you see is an economy that has reacted well to that.  So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it.  We never take into account political considerations.  There\u2019s no place in our discuss ions for that.  We also don\u2019t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence.

So I was wondering if you could talk about what you\u2014what was your res ponse to them when those concerns were raised ?  I\u2019ve    collected a couple of things from the IMF , and the Bank of International Settlements said that it\u2019s just\u2014when you have low rates, you just get more debt in the economy, and that there\u2019s also this feeling  that it makes it harder to raise rates.  So could you talk about that?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye s.  So, first , let me say \u2014I\u2019ll just speak for myself, but I understand those concerns very well.  I do.  I\u2019ve \u2014you know, I\u2019ve studied them, I\u2019ve spoken about them, and I take them very seriously.  But as I look at today\u2019s situation, I don\u2019t see them as a reason not to take this action today.  I just don\u2019t think\u2014that would be my point.  And one of the reasons why I think that is , if you look\u2014if you look\u2014so  we have a financial stability framework now for the first time.  Before the crisis, we didn\u2019t have this, but now we have it, and we publish it.  And we look at , really , four big things so that we know we can\u2014 you know, the public can hold us accountable and compare us meeting to meeting , and\u2014you know, and see whether we got this right , because it\u2019s transparent now. But the four things we look at are valuation pressures .  And we do see notable valuation pressures in some markets but , you know, honestly , not at a highly troubling level.  In terms of household borrowing, household and business borrowing is the second thing .  Households are in a very good shape overall.  I\u2019ll come back to business borrowing.  Leverage in the financial system is low, and funding risk is low.  So, overall, staff\u2019s view has been\u2014 and my view has been \u2014that if you look overall , financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate.  The place that gets all the attention right now \u2014a lot of attention \u2014is business borrowing, and we look very car efully at that.  What\u2019s happening with business borrowing is , the loans have moved off the balance sheets of the banks and into market -based vehicles, which tend to be stably funded.  B ut, nonetheless, it\u2019s clear that the highly leveraged business sector c ould act as an amplifier to a downturn.  So we\u2019re watching that very carefully.  But , again, I think if you    look overall at the U.S. financial system, what you see is a high level of resilience\u2014much higher than it was before the crisis \u2014and that\u2019s something  to take comfort from.  And I think all of that gives us the ability to use monetary policy for its purposes and rely on supervisory and regulatory tools to \u2014you know, to keep the financial system resilient\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: So you\u2019re not doing something today f or\u2014to help today, and then it\u2019s going to cause problems down the road?  Y ou\u2019re not worried about that kind of dynamic?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: There are very few things that I don\u2019t worry about at all.  So, of course, of course, we monitor.  We have\u2014every quarter w e have an extensive briefing on financial stability, and we had that yesterday.  So we look at this on an ongoing basis.  We have a great team.  We liaise with central banks around the world.  You know, one of my colleagues is the head of the Financial Stability Board globally, so we\u2019re very, very much monitoring these things all the time.  And we worry about them all the time.  We\u2019re always looking at the \u2014we\u2019re looking for that thing that we may have missed a lot of the time.  But the things we haven\u2019t missed, I think they paint a mixed picture, but not one that should prevent us from taking monetary policy actions that we think are appropriate to support the economy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Marty Crutsinger, AP.  You\u2019ve talked in this press conference about be ing data dependent going forward, and that this is not the start of a series of rate cuts.  But the financial markets seem to think that this is the start of a series of rate cuts, and they\u2019re predicting three, four cuts this year.  Is this your effort to try to damp down that \u2014that  thing?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: No .  Let me be clear.  What I said was , it\u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts.  I didn\u2019t \u2014I didn\u2019t  say it \u2019s just one or anything like that.  What I said is, when you think about rate -cutting cycles, they go on for a long time, and the    Committee is not seeing that\u2014not seeing us in that place.  You would do that if you saw real economic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot.  That\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing.  That\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing.  What we\u2019re seeing is that it\u2019s appropriate to \u2014to adjust policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking  at it.  What I said was , it\u2019s not a long cutting cycle \u2014in other words , referring to what we do when there\u2019s a recession or a very severe downturn.  That\u2019s \u2014that\u2019s  really what I was ruling out.  I think, if you look back at other midcycle adjustments , you\u2019l l see\u2014 you know, I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll be , in the end, comparable or not, but you\u2019ll see examples of these\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Don Lee with the L.A. Times .  You mentioned the difficulty of assessing trade tensions in  the economic outlook.  Could you say how much of a factor the U.S.\u2013China trade conflict was in the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates ?  And if the current stalemate and the threat of more tariffs continue , what would that mean for future interest rates and possible cuts?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, you know, I wouldn\u2019t bring it down to any one trade thing or any one factor.  I think we look at a broad range of factors , and trade uncertainty \u2014trade policy uncertainty is one of them .  That certainly includes the discussions with China, but I wouldn\u2019t \u2014I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you how much of it is due to that.  And without knowing \u2014you know, I think we \u2014with trade , we have to react to the developments, and we don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be , and so it\u2019s hard to exactly say.  Certainly, we\u2019ve seen , though, that when there\u2019s a s harp confrontation between two large economies, you can see effects on business confidence pretty quickly and on financial markets pretty quickly.  We saw that in June .  But then we saw them unwind after that , to some extent.  You\u2019ve seen it returning to \u2014to a much lower temperature, I    think.

They\u2019re not large as it relates to the U.S. economy.  The real question is , what are the effects on the economy through the \u2014through the  confidence channel \u2014business confidence channel ?  And , again, very, v ery hard to tease that out.  I\u2019ve seen some research, which \u2014you know, which says that they are meaningful \u2014meaningful effects on \u2014on output .  That\u2019s  to say , not trivial.  And I think that that sounds right, but it\u2019s quite hard to get \u2014there is no way to get a n accurate measure.  You have to look at a range of estimates, and I think businesses will tell you that it\u2019s a factor, particularly businesses that have\u2014manufacturing businesses that have supply chains that cross international borders will all tell you th at it\u2019s been a challenge.

Thanks for the question, Chairman.  As the press conference \u2014as this press conference has gone under  way, markets have declined .  The Dow is down as much as 400 points.  What I\u2019m hearing is a reluctance to provide more guidance around the future path of rates.  And I\u2019m wondering if that reflects a greater lack of consensus on the Committee .  And, you know, how much consensus do you want to see around these decisions , and how split are people about this?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, you\u2019re right.  T here\u2019s a range of views on the Committee, and\u2014but the C ommittee is unifie d, completely unified on our dedication to making the best policy decisions that we can make .  And that means people have a responsibility to do their best thinking and to present that thinking, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.     In terms of the way for ward, we will be monitoring the factors that I mentioned, and we laid that out in the \u2014you know, in the postmeeting statement, and that\u2019s the roadmap we\u2019re going to be following going forward.

And they\u2019re not going to be fixed\u2014they haven\u2019t been fixed  quickly , and, frankly, we didn\u2019t expect them to be fixed quickly.  So they\u2019re \u2014you know, they \u2014they will be under the growth cap, our enforcement action, until the Board votes to lift it, and that\u2019s not something we\u2019re considering doing right now.  And the Committee \u2014I mean, the company is working away to address these issues, but , as I said, they\u2019re deep -seated issues, and it just takes time to address them.

So when we have our next recession, the Fed will have less room \u2014it will happen \u2014the Fed will have less room to maneuver cutting interest rates since you\u2019re cutting now.  How bi g of a problem will that be\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, the premise is not \u2014I will question your premise for a second.  If you remember  whether \u2014again, one of the purposes of our \u2014of our  cut today is to support the expansion.

Again, I\u2019m not predicting that, but I don\u2019t think that we know that we won\u2019t have \u2014that we\u2019ll have less ammo because of these things.  That\u2019s one thing.

I mean,  you will have \u2014have  less ammo , in that sense.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, but you\u2019re assuming that we would never raise rates again, that once we\u2019ve cut these rates that they can never go back up again.  Just as a matter of principle, I don\u2019t think tha t\u2019s right.  In other \u2014in other  long, long cycles, long U.S. business cycles have sometimes involved this kind of event where the Fed will stop hiking \u2014in fact , will cut\u2014and then will go back to hiking.  Again, I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019ll happen right here.  It doesn\u2019t    seem \u2014it doesn\u2019t seem like something that\u2019s  in\u2014you know, particularly likely, frankly, but we don\u2019t know that. And the other thing is, I think by extending the cycle , you\u2014you do have a lot of benefits from that .  And I think, you know, we will use the tools that we have .  A couple of rate hikes one way or the other isn\u2019t going to matter so much if there is a downturn.  And you\u2019re right, there will eventually be one.

It\u2019s not something that enters directly into our discussions today.  We\u2019ve had\u2014so far we\u2019ve had a series of meetings , called Fed Listens , at almost all the R eserve Banks.  Soon it will  be all the R eserve Banks.

Just to expand on that point about communication , I mean , we saw that markets have been particularly sensitive with  regards to New York Fed P resident John Williams\u2019s remarks before the blackout period.

I\u2019m wondering\u2014now there\u2019s kind of this inflection point about whether or not the downside risk, because you\u2019ve had to cut rates , outweighs the fact that you still see a positive outlook of the U.S. economy at a baseline.

Ye ah, so again, I see the U.S. outlook as being a positive one.  And we do \u2014we have had these global , really, risks to the outlook.

Additionally, the FOMC has decided to conclude the runoff of their securities portfolio in August instead of September.The FOMC has adjusted its interest rate target to the low end of estimates of neutral, reflecting the importance of sustaining the expansion and reaching more individuals in low and middle-income communities. The Committee's assessment of the appropriate path of interest rates has been influenced by weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation, leading to a patient stance and easing of financial conditions to support the economy.Despite both positive and negative developments, job growth remained strong in June and is expected to continue at a slower pace than last year but still above the necessary level to maintain a steady unemployment rate. While GDP growth met expectations, manufacturing output and business fixed investment declined, and foreign growth, particularly in manufacturing, fell short. Central banks worldwide are responding to this weakness by increasing policy accommodation. Trade policy tensions have eased slightly, but ongoing uncertainty is causing some companies to be more cautious with their capital spending.The domestic inflation shortfall has continued, with core inflation running at 1.6 percent over the past year. While we expect inflation to eventually return to 2 percent, current pressures remain muted and below-target inflation could lead to worrisome downward expectations. Despite these concerns, the Committee still sees a favorable outlook, but incoming information on global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have led to gradual adjustments in the path of policy interest rates. As we continue to monitor the economic outlook, we will take appropriate action to sustain the expansion and achieve our 2 percent inflation objective.\"The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\" \n\nSummary: The Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low until the labor market improves and inflation reaches and exceeds 2 percent. They will also continue to buy Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities until there is significant progress towards their employment and price stability goals.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Is a 25 basis point cut enough to bring inflation back to the 2 percent target, and what would convince you to cut rates again?\n'ANSWER': The 25 basis point cut is part of a series of actions taken by the Committee throughout the year. The more accommodative policy has supported the economy as expected. The cut is aimed at insuring against downside risks, providing support to the economy, and supporting inflation, and is seen as a midcycle adjustment to policy.", "'QUESTION': There is a perception that the Fed is trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist, as consumer spending reports and interest rates suggest there is no demand issue. What problem will lower capital costs solve?\n'ANSWER': The economy is performing well and is close to meeting objectives. However, there are downside risks from weakening global growth, trade policy developments, and inflation running below target. Lowering capital costs is aimed at supporting and maintaining the favorable outlook in the face of these risks.", "'QUESTION': How does cutting interest rates lower borrowing costs and support economic activity?\n'ANSWER': Cutting interest rates lowers borrowing costs and supports economic activity by boosting confidence and encouraging household and business spending. This is achieved through both confidence channels and mechanical channels, as evidenced by the improvement in financial conditions, increased confidence, and healthy economic activity since the policy was implemented.", "'QUESTION': Can you give us a sense of how the better-than-expected data impacted the FOMC's thinking and if it changes any FOMC thinking going forward?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC carefully analyzed the positive and negative aspects of the US economy, which has shown resilience. However, the focus remains on addressing downside risks and inflation shortfall. Going forward, the FOMC will monitor trade uncertainty, global growth, low inflation, and the performance of the US economy to inform policy decisions.", "'QUESTION': Are we now more focused on trade talks rather than unemployment rate and inflation numbers?\n'ANSWER': Yes, the recent rate cut is a form of insurance against downside risks from weak global growth and trade tensions. Trade tensions have a significant effect on financial market conditions and the economy, and we have to follow them closely. However, we do not assess or evaluate trade policies, as that is not our job.", "'QUESTION': Which factors weigh most heavily on the decision to cut rates and will a \u00c2\u00bc point cut address all of them?\n'ANSWER': Different factors have different weightings for different people. Lower neutral rate, global slowdown, trade tensions, and lower natural rate of unemployment all point to the need for more accommodation. The \u00c2\u00bc point cut is not the only consideration, but rather the overall shift in the Committee's stance towards rate cuts and its impact on the economy.", "'QUESTION': Where is the bar for cutting rates right now and how is the Committee responding?\n'ANSWER': The Committee will continue to monitor incoming information and assess factors such as weak global growth, trade developments, inflation, and the performance of the US economy in making future rate decisions. Trade is a factor that needs to be assessed in a new way, and the Committee will learn more about it as the cycle progresses.", "QUESTION: Could the Fed waiting too long to cut rates be a reason for weakness in business investment and manufacturing?\n\nANSWER: Businesses are not citing high interest rates as a reason for not investing, but rather weak demand for their products. Global manufacturing and investment have been slowing down, which is a bigger factor than expected. Trade policy uncertainty has also been higher than anticipated. The rate cut is believed to be the right move to address these issues.", "'QUESTION': What does \"a midcycle adjustment to policy\" mean and what message does it convey about future rate moves?\n'ANSWER': \"A midcycle adjustment to policy\" refers to cutting rates in the middle of an economic cycle, contrasting it with the beginning of a longer cutting cycle. This move suggests that future rate moves may not necessarily indicate a prolonged period of rate cuts.", "'QUESTION': So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not at the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle?\n'ANSWER': That is not what we're seeing now. It's not our perspective or outlook.", "'QUESTION': Are there any circumstances under which you would decide to pause at one interest rate cut and not go ahead with further monetary easing?\n'ANSWER': Our policy will depend on incoming data and evolving risks to the economic outlook. We will be monitoring the implications of incoming information and make decisions based on that.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree with Vice Chairman Quarles' suggestion to have the ability to turn down capital requirements in a downturn? Is it fair to say that building a real-time payment system would be a bait-and-switch?\n'ANSWER': I believe the current level of capital requirements is appropriate. While the idea of turning down capital requirements in a downturn is under consideration, our system relies on high through-the-cycle capital and liquidity requirements. As for real-time payments, the Fed is considering building a system to address the lag in the US, and it wouldn't be unusual given our past operations alongside private-sector operators. A decision on this is expected soon.", "'QUESTION': Are you saying that with one or two more rate cuts, the policy bias will be removed from the statement?\n'ANSWER': The decision to adjust policy to a more accommodative stance depends on evolving data and risks. We will continue to assess incoming data, risks, the performance of the US economy, and low inflation to make future decisions.", "'QUESTION': How is the rate cut expected to help people who are just recently feeling the recovery?\n'ANSWER': The rate cut aims to sustain the expansion and keep the economy going, benefiting those who are now feeling the recovery. The goal is to maintain maximum employment and stable prices, as there is no troublingly high inflation or booming sector that might lead to a bust. The rate cut also aims to support the manufacturing economy and overall economic balance.", "'QUESTION': What do you say to those that say that the Fed gave into what the President wanted today? And could you also elaborate a little bit further on why the Fed decided to speed up its balance sheet runoff two months earlier today?\n'ANSWER': The rate hike and balance sheet runoff decision was made to address downside risks from weak global growth and trade tensions, promote inflation return to 2%, and provide more accommodation. Political considerations are not taken into account, and the Fed's goal is to move closer to statutory goals. The decision to speed up the balance sheet runoff was for simplicity and consistency.", "QUESTION: What was Chairman Powell's response to concerns about financial stability raised by the dissenters?\n\nANSWER: Chairman Powell acknowledged the concerns about financial stability but stated that he did not see them as a reason to not take action. He highlighted the financial stability framework in place, which includes monitoring valuation pressures, household and business borrowing, leverage in the financial system, and funding risk. Overall, he believes that the U.S. financial system is resilient and can rely on monetary policy and regulatory tools to maintain stability.", "'QUESTION': So you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not doing something today for\u00e2\u0080\u0094to help today, and then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to cause problems down the road? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not worried about that kind of dynamic?\n'ANSWER': We constantly monitor financial stability and have an extensive briefing on it every quarter.

While we worry about potential risks, we believe the current situation should not hinder us from taking appropriate monetary policy actions to support the economy.", "'QUESTION': Are the recent rate cuts the start of a series of cuts as predicted by the financial markets?\n'ANSWER': No, the Chair clarified that while it's not just one cut, it's also not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts. The Committee is not seeing a need for a prolonged cutting cycle due to real economic weakness. The adjustment in policy is towards a more accommodative stance over time, not a severe downturn.", "'QUESTION': How much of a factor was the U.S.-China trade conflict in the Fed's decision to cut rates and what would it mean for future interest rates if the conflict continues?\n'ANSWER': Trade uncertainty, including the discussions with China, is one of the factors considered by the Fed. The effects of a sharp confrontation between two large economies can be seen on business confidence and financial markets, as seen in June. The Fed will continue to monitor and assess the implications of trade policy on the U.S. outlook.", "'QUESTION': How much of an effect could the tariffs have?\n'ANSWER': The mechanical effects of the tariffs are small, but the real question is the impact on business confidence. It is difficult to accurately measure, but research suggests there are meaningful effects on output. Businesses, especially those with international supply chains, have found it challenging and have made adjustments.", "'QUESTION': Does the lack of guidance on future rates reflect a lack of consensus within the Committee and how divided are people about this?\n'ANSWER': While there is a range of views within the Committee, we are completely unified in our dedication to making the best policy decisions. We encourage members to present their thinking and we will be monitoring factors and remaining data dependent to support economic expansion.", "'QUESTION': Can you characterize the progress Wells Fargo has made in addressing its risk management shortcomings and has the lack of a permanent CEO hindered their progress?\n\n'ANSWER': The problems at Wells Fargo regarding risk management and consumer issues were deep-seated and the company acknowledges this. The issues have not been resolved quickly, as expected. The growth cap will remain until the Board decides to lift it, and the company is actively working to address the problems. No comment on the CEO question.", "'QUESTION': Are you pleased with the responsiveness from the company and is it going the way you wanted it to go?\n'ANSWER': I'm not going to characterize it, but we have an enforcement action in place and the company is working on addressing it seriously. We will lift the growth cap when we are satisfied.", "'QUESTION': So when we have our next recession, the Fed will have less room to maneuver cutting interest rates since you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cutting now. How big of a problem will that be?\n'ANSWER': The premise is questioned, as the purpose of the current rate cut is to support the expansion. If the cut is successful and the economy improves, there is a possibility that the Fed may raise rates again in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the Fed will have less ammunition in the event of a future recession.", "'QUESTION': Won't the ability to cut rates be limited if rates are already low?\n'ANSWER': The assumption that rates can never go back up again is incorrect. In previous long business cycles, the Fed has cut rates and then raised them again. While it may not be likely in this case, extending the cycle has its benefits. A couple of rate hikes won't matter much in a downturn, and the Fed will use all tools aggressively when needed.", "QUESTION: Can you give us an update on the ongoing reassessment of the inflation framework and have the discussions so far this year had any bearing on today's decision?\n\nANSWER: The monetary policy review is focused on long-term policy-making and does not directly impact today's decision. We have been conducting Fed Listens meetings with various constituencies to gather feedback on how their lives intersect with the Fed's work. We are in the early stages of incorporating this feedback and evaluating our framework's performance. It's a good time to reassess and improve our framework.", "'QUESTION': Can you give us a sense of whether the Committee feels constrained at all by the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectations for more cuts or other developments in financial markets?\n'ANSWER': The Committee's actions were consistent with what was previously communicated and well telegraphed. Monetary policy works through communications and actions, and the changes made this year have been effective. However, the Committee retains flexibility to adjust based on incoming data and evolving risks.", "'QUESTION': Can you clarify the balance between the downside risks of cutting rates and the positive outlook of the US economy, considering the challenges of communication?\n'ANSWER': The US economy has a positive outlook and there are no prominent near-term threats. The downside risks come from abroad, particularly affecting the manufacturing sector and business investment. The Fed is also concerned about low inflation."]}
