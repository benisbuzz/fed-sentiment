And thank you, Chair Powell.  So it \u2019s expected that the Fed will hike rates perhaps every other meeting , but certainly in the past, the Fed has hiked at every meeting.  So I just wanted to ask, you know, are rate hikes at consecutive meetings on the table this year?  Is every meeting a live \u2014a live  meeting?  And, on that note, would the F ed consider f ront-loading some of its rate hikes, even if it doesn \u2019t raise at every meeting?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thanks.  So , as I \u2014as I  referred to in my opening statement, it \u2019s\u2014it is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to prove appropriate.  And so, at this time, we haven\u2019 t made any decisions about the path of policy.  And I stress again that we\u2019 ll be humble and nimble.  We\u2019 re going to have to navigate crosscurrents and actually two -sided risks now.  So\u2014and, and I \u2019ll say also that we \u2019re going to be guided by the data.  In fact, what I \u2019ll say is that we\u2019 re going to be led by the incoming data and the evolving outlook, which we \u2019ll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily and transparency \u2014tran sparently.  So more to your question, w e know that the economy is in a very different place than it was when we began raising rates in 2015.  Specifically, the economy is now much stronger.  The labor market is far stronger.  Inflation is running well above our 2 percent target, much higher than it was at that time.  And these differences are likely to have important implications for the appropriate pace of policy adjustments.  Beyond that, we  haven \u2019t made any decisions\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask, you were talking about the health of the labor market.  And I \u2019m curious whether you would characterize where we \u2019re at right now as maximum employment .  And also, along those same lines, obviously rate hikes [are] on the table this year, do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control without hurting jobs and wages?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Sorr y.  Just getting both, both parts of your question written down.  So I would say\u2014and this view is widely held on the Committee \u2014that both sides of the mandate are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the pandemic.  And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employ ment that is consistent with price stability.  And that is \u2014that is  my personal view.  And, and, again, very broad support on the Committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.  The other thi ng is , maximum employment will, will evolve over time and through the course of the business cycle.  In the particular situation we \u2019re in now, it may well increase .  Max\u2014the level of maximum\u2014of employment that \u2019s consistent with stable prices may increase.  And we hope that it will , as more people come back into the labor market, as participation gradually rises.  And the policy path that we \u2019re broadly contemplating would be supportive of that comment\u2014that outcom e as well.  So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are \u2014there are many millions of, of more job openings than there are unemployed people.  So you ask whether we can\u2014whether we can raise rates and , and move to less accommodative , and eve n tight , financial    conditions without hurting the labor market.  I think there \u2019s quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market.  This is, by so many measures, a historically tight labor market .  Record levels of job openi ngs, of quits.  Wages are moving up at the highest pace they have in decades.  If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs plentiful.  Look at surveys of companies \u2014they find workers scarce.  And all of those readings are at levels, really , that we ha ven\u2019t seen in a long time \u2014and, in some cases, ever.  So this is a very, very strong labor market , and my strong sense is that we can \u2014we can \u2014we can  move rates up without , without  having to, you know, severely undermine it.  I also would point out that there are\u2014there are other forces at work this year, which should also help bring down inflation, w e hope , including improvement on the supply side, which will ultimately come .  The timing and pace of that are uncertain.  And also, fiscal policy is going to be less supportive of , of growth this year \u2014not of  the level of economic activity , but the fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower.  So there are multiple forces \u2014which should be working over the course of the year for  inflation to come down.  We do realize that the timing and pace of that are , are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we \u2014than we thought.  And, of course, we \u2019re prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does not be come entrenched.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Good afternoon, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  I , I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet.  The stateme nt on the balance sheet today calls for \u201csignificantly reducing \u201d your holdings.  What does that mean?  And then, apart from moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and your colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process?  And, finally, how much    disagreement is there around how you should use this tool, including active sales rather than passive sales or changes in the composition of reinvestments?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I \u2019m afraid to tell you that those are all great questions, and they\u2019 re questions that the Committee is just turning to now.  So we had\u2014we had  a discussion, as you know, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a teeing up of the issues.  At this meeting, we \u2019ve gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a high level.  And those are meant to gui de the actual decisions we\u2019 ll make about the pace and about all of the questions that you \u2019re, you\u2019re  asking.  And I expect that this process will , will be something that we spen d time on in coming meetings.  I can \u2019t tell you how many.  I can \u2019t tell you  how long it will take.  But \u2014and then, you know, at the appropriate time, we \u2019ll provide additional information.  So I did\u2014the last cycle when we \u2014when we  went through balance sheet issues, we did find that over , over  the course of two or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought.  So we \u2019re just in that process now.  And at the next meeting, we \u2019ll be turning to, you know, more of the details that you \u2019re\u2014that you\u2019re  asking about. I would say this.  The balance sheet is, is  much bigger.  I \u2019d say it has a shorter duration than the last time.  And the economy \u2019s much stronger, and inflation is much higher.  So \u2014and I think that leads you to\u2014 and I said , I\u2019ve said this \u2014being willing to move sooner than we did the last time and also perhaps faster.  But beyond that, it \u2019s really \u2014it\u2019s really  not appropriate for me to speculate exactly what that would be.  And , and\u2014but I would point you to principle number one, which is \u201c the Committee views changes in the target range  for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.\u201d   So we do want the federal funds rate\u2014we , we want to operationalize that  [as the primary means] .  And we want the bala nce sheet    to be declining in a predictable manner, and we want it to be declining primarily by adjusting reinvestments.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: So, if I could follow on that, raising rates and reducing the balance sheet both restrain the economy, both tighten mone tary policy.  How should we think about the relationship between the two?  For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every \u00bc percentage point increase in your benchmark rate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, again, we think of the balance sheet as , as moving in a  predictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them, it \u2019s the federal funds rate.  There are\u2014there are  rules of thumb \u2014I\u2019m reluctant to land on one of them \u2014that , that  equate this.  And \u2014but  there \u2019s also an element of , of uncertainty around the balance sheet.  I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and, hence, economic conditions.  Balance sheet [policy] is , is still a relatively new thing for, for  the markets and for us, so we\u2019 re less certain about that.  So, again, our \u2014I think our \u2014the pattern we \u2019ll follow is to \u2014is to  arrive at a, you know, a timing and a pace and composition and all those things and then announce that with advance notice, and, and it will\u2014 it will start in the background.  And then we \u2019ll look to have that just running in the background and have \u2014and have  the interest rates, again, be the active tool of monetary policy.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s  at least the  plan.  I can \u2019t tell you much more about any of the \u2014any of the  very good issues about size, pace, composition, those sorts of things.  But w e\u2019ll be turning to all of those at coming meetings.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chair Powell.  It \u2019s Neil Irwin from Axios.  Glad to be back. Sir, I was wondering if the volatility we \u2019ve seen in financial markets in the last few weeks strikes you as anything alarming or that might affect the trajectory of policy.  Conversely, to the degree that financial conditions have tightened some, might that be desirable in some ways in achieving your, your  tightening goals?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real economy:  maximum employment and price stability.  And financial conditions matter to the extent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate.  And you also know that we , we look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets.  And what we\u2019re always asking ourselve s is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material enough that \u2014of a change in financial conditions \u2014that they are inconsistent with the achievement of our goals?  So that \u2019s how we \u2019re looking at that.  And I don\u2019 t want to comment on today\u2019 s financial conditions broadly, but we \u2019re not looking at any one market or , or so.  So that \u2019s how we \u2019re thinking.  In terms of what we \u2019ve seen, I would say this.  We, you know, we said at our last meeting we published the  Summary of E conomic P rojections, the me dian of which\u2014the median participant expected three rate increases this year.  And, you know, it \u2019s six weeks, seven weeks later now.  And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working.  Markets are, are  now pricing in a number of  rate increases.  Surveys show that market participants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin, you know, at the appropriate time , sometime later this year perhaps.  We haven \u2019t made that decision yet.  So we , we feel like the communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and    that financial conditions are reflecting in advance the decisions that we make.  And monetary policy works significantly through expectations.  So that , that  in and of itself is appropria te\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: You know, for a year or so\u2014Hi.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  So for a year now, the statements referenced the benchmarks for this initial interest rate increase.  Now that we \u2019re approaching that moment, what are the benchmarks going to be for subsequent rate increases?  I know you can\u2019 t stipulate the path, but how s hould we think about the criteria for the next step and the next step?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, you\u2019 re right.  We haven \u2019t got\u2014we haven \u2019t gotten to that point  yet.  We haven \u2019t made a decision yet, and we \u2019ll make that decision at the March meeting.  We\u2019 ll make a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate.  I would say that the Committee is , is of a mind to , to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so.  We have\u2014 we have  our eyes on, on the risks,  particularly around the world.  But we do expect some softening in the economy from Omicron, but we think that  that should be temporary.  And we think that the economy should \u2014the underlying strength of the economy should, you know, should, should\u2014show thr ough fairly quickly after that.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could follow just on a related question, the December SEPs had this copacetic sort of set of circumstances where inflation comes down without the federal funds rate ever getting over the estimate of n eutral.  Given developments since then, do you still think that \u2019s a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I think the p ath is highly uncertain and that we \u2019re committed to using our tools to make sure that inflation, high inflation that we \u2019re seeing , does not become entrenched.  So a number of factors would be \u2014it\u2019s not just monetary policy \u2014a number of    factors are supporting a decline in inflation, as I mentioned.  Fiscal policy will be \u2014will provid e significantly less of an impulse to growth.  We do expect this year \u2014although we do expect now that it will come slower than , than we had expected and hoped\u2014that there will be relief on the supply side.  So that, too, should\u2014should lower the supply- side barriers, which are a big pa rt of the story of why inflation  is high.  I n addition, monetary policy will be becoming significantly less accommodative.  So the question is \u2014you know, we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll be asking this question all year long, and that will be , are things turning out as we expec t?  There \u2019s a case that, for whatever reason, the economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected ; we\u2019ll react to that.  If, instead, we see inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level, then we \u2019ll react to that.  And, again, we\u2019re, we\u2019 re well aware that this is a different economy than \u2014than existed during the last tightening cycle, and our policy is going to reflect those differences.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I have one sort of technical question and one question on principle.  The technical question is, if , if you\u2019 re going to discuss balance sheet at the next upcoming meetings and you won\u2019 t begin balance sheet reduction until after you begin rate hikes, it seems to technically mean that you won\u2019 t or can \u2019t begin balance sheet reduction until the summer.  I s that corre ct?  That \u2019s the first thing.  Second of all, you suggested that , that  the\u2014with balance sheet running in the background \u2014that you would possibly be raising rates and running off the balance sheet at the    same time.  That\u2019s sort of the  technical question part of it.  The principal  question I have is , you said it \u2019s going to be running in the background.  But the statement on the balance sheet principles  says \u201c the Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach \u201d based on \u201ceconomic and financial developments, \u201d which suggests there \u2019s something of a reaction function associated to the balance sheet and it won\u2019 t be running in the background.  So can you give us any sense of the discussion or staff presentation on what is the reaction functi on surrounding the balance sheet?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So let me \u2014let me \u2014let me  start by talking about that last paragraph.  So you\u2019 ll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the balance sheet is a complicated o ne, and it involves , inevitably , surprises.  And so during, during the years , during the prior cycle, we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times.  Now, we didn\u2019 t intend to do that.  It just\u2014events required us to do so.  So we got a pretty robust paragraph there that says we\u2019 re free to do this at any time.  And it doesn \u2019t mean we\u2019 re going to, but if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we \u2019re not going to be \u2014we \u2019re not going to stick with something that isn\u2019 t working.  Th at\u2019s all that \u2019s saying.  It\u2019 s meant to be quite a general statement rather than a , a hint.  So, I mean, I like to think that our, you know, our philosophy of the balance sheet is , is embodied in these principles .  So, you know, the idea that, for example, the federal funds rate is the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, that we \u2019ll use \u2014determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate, that we\u2019ll  begin to reduce the size after we begin th e process of raising rates, and on and on like that.  I mean, that \u2014those are all the things that , that  try to describe how we will proceed.     But maybe at a higher level, to try to get at your question :  You know, asset purchases were , were  enormously import ant at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market function, as they were at \u2014right after the \u2014in the critical phase of the G lobal F inancial C risis.  And then after  [that], they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand.  And now the economy no longer needs this , this  highly accommodative policy that we put in place.  So it \u2019s time to stop asset purchases first and then, at the appropriate time, start to shrink the balance sheet.  Now, the balance sheet is, is  substantially larger than it needs to be.  We\u2019 ve identified the end state as \u2014in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently [and]  effectively in the ample -reserves  regime.  So there \u2019s a substantial amount of , of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done.  That\u2019s going to take some time.  We want that process to be orderly and predictable.  And so those are some of the ways that I would think this , this  lays out our , you know, the way we\u2014the way we \u2019re thinking about this.  In terms of the timing, I can \u2019t really help you.  You know, it just says after , after  we get under  way.  So we \u2019re\u2014I would say we are , we\u2019re going to have another discussion at , at the next meeting.  And my guess is , we\u2019ll have at least one other d iscussion at the meeting after that.  And, you know, we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll  tell you as we make progress.  And we \u2019ll, you know, we \u2019ll start the process of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet at what we find to be the appropriate time.  It \u2019s\u2014I wish I coul d say more.  But, honestly, we haven\u2019 t made those decisions.  And we actually haven \u2019t even really had the , the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will have at coming meetings.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Powell, Chair Powell.  Good afternoon, Michelle and Chair Powell.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg.  Chair Powell, at the beginning of the conversation, you    said risks are two sided.  And I \u2019m wondering if you can elaborate on what are the risks to the elusive soft landing.  Is Fed policy a risk?  Overtightening?  Or what are the risks?  And then second, Chair Powell, I have a quick administrative question.  You know, Robert Kaplan\u2019 s disclosure of his securities transactions\u2014and in a couple of months, Chair Powell, or maybe sooner, you and I will file our tax returns.  And we \u2019ll list transactions and all kinds of things.  And next to those transactions , we\u2019ll put dates.  And Bloomberg asked for the dates of Mr.  Kaplan \u2019s transactions.  The Dall as Fed is not giving us the dates.  And I don\u2019 t see why this is a matter for the i nspector general or anybody else.  I mean, why can \u2019t he give us the dates?  Will you help us get the dates of those transactions?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So you asked about t he risks first.  So I \u2014you know, the one risk is that inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of  most FOMC participants and , certainly , in my view as well.  There \u2019s a risk that , that the  high inflation we \u2019re seeing will be prolonged, and there \u2019s a risk that it will move even higher.  So we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019t  think that \u2019s the base case, but you asked what the risks are.  And that \u2019s\u2014we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes.  And that calls for  us to be in position.  We, we  have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved, but we \u2019ve got to be in a position to, to address different outcomes, including the one where inflation remains higher.  And, of course, that is a risk to th e\u2014to the \u2014to the  expansion.  You know, we \u2019ve been saying that what we need here is another long expansion, which is the kind of thing we saw over the last  [one] , which was  a record long expansion.  We saw labor force participation rise.  We saw wages persis tently higher for people at the lower end, and there , there really was no obvious    imbalance in the economy that threatened that expansion.  It could have gone on for years were it not hit by the pandemic.  So we\u2019d love to find a way to get back to that.  Th at\u2019s going to require price stability, and that\u2019s going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.  So I mentioned two- sided risks.  You know, a couple things.  One, Omi \u2014COVID is not over.  And COVID can continue to evolve, and it \u2019s just \u2014we have to accept that it \u2019s not over, and the risks to it can slow down growth.  And that would be \u2014that \u2019s sort of a downside risk from a growth standpo int.  I would point to\u2014you know, another , another  risk is just further, further problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity.  And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that \u2019s\u2014their no- COVID policy may cause more lockdowns , is likely to, and that may play into\u2014 may play into more problems in supply chains.  In addition, there \u2019s what \u2019s going on in Eastern Europe and things like that.  So there \u2019s plenty of risk out there.  And we, you know, we can\u2019 t\u2014we can\u2019t  forget that the re are risks on both sides.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  there.  That \u2019s what I would say. I know you\u2019 ve been all over this issue with , with  my colleagues, Craig, on the issue of , of information.  We don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019t  have that information at the Board.  And, you know, I hand\u2014I asked the i nspector g eneral to do an investigation, and that is out of my hands.  I play no role in it.  I seek to play no role in it.  And I don\u2019 t\u2014I really \u2014I can \u2019t help you here today on this i ssue.  And I \u2019m sorry I can \u2019t\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.  And sorry for my tech issues.  I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about where your thinking on inflation stands today.  You know, the last time we saw an SEP back in September, we saw that you and your colleagues were projecting that inflation would sort of sink back down quite close to target by the end of the year.  And I wo nder if you still think that projection from December is a reasonable one.  And if your thinking has changed at all, I wonder how you\u2019 re thinking about that.  And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that deceleratio n.  Like, how  do\u2014how  do we get from here, 7 percent  CPI, to where you expect to be at the end of the year \n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I \u2019d say, you know, since , since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same but probably sligh tly worse.  I \u2019d be inclined to raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation \u2014let \u2019s just go with that \u2014by a few tenths today.  B ut we \u2019re not writing , writing  down an SEP at this meeting.  B ut I think it \u2019s\u2014it hasn \u2019t gotten better.  It\u2019 s probably gotten just a \u2014just a  bit worse, and that \u2019s been the pattern.  That \u2019s been the pattern.  So I think if you look at the\u2014the FOMC participants are\u2014there \u2019s a range there.  And that range has been moving to the right for , for a year now.  And, by the way, if you look at other forecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living , you\u2019 ve seen the same pattern.  So , what do we think about that?  Well, I think we , you know, we wrote down rate increases in the December meetings, each of us ind ividually.  And I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that, if it deteriorates meaningfully further, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension.  So that \u2019s how we\u2019re thinking a bout it.     I\u2014as I mentioned, though, I think it \u2019s\u2014part of this will be that us, the Fed , moving away from a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy and then, over time, to a policy that \u2019s not accommodative , in time.  I don \u2019t know when that will be.  That\u2019s\u2014those are the things that we\u2019 re\u2014that we\u2019re  thinki ng about.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s  part of it.  Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years.  That impulse will be less, in fact, will be \u2014will be  negative this year.  And so that \u2019s another thing.  The other one is , we will eventually get relief on the supply side.  And, you know, the ports will be cleared up.  And there will be semiconductors and things like that.  Now, what we\u2019re learning is, it \u2019s just taking much longer , so I think\u2014 longer than expected.  And that , I think, does raise, raise  the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.  I do think we \u2019ll come off of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the \u2014in the  spring last year.  But, really, what \u2019s\u2014the question is going to be , what i s inflation running at?  And so we \u2019ll be watching that.  And I , you know, we \u2014our objective is to get inflation back down to 2 percent .  It\u2019s also to provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy.  The labor market is very, very strong right now, and I think that  that strength will continue.  There \u2019s a\u2014there \u2019s really a shortage of workers.  We see it particularly among production and nonsupervisory workers and people in the lowest quartile.  You see very large wage increases.  I mentioned some of the other indicators.  So I think that \u2019s, that\u2019s  what we \u2019re looking at.  And we \u2019re also \u2014you know, we realize, I think, as everyone does , that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we \u2019re going to have to adapt.  And we \u2019re going to communicate as clearly as we can.  But we \u2019re going to have to be adaptable and , you know, move , move  as appropriate.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, when you talk about being humble and nimble about the path forward for monetary policy, does that also include the possibility of raising interest rates by large r increments and, say, doing a 50 basis point hike at some point if inflation does not moderate sufficiently?  And should we interpret this approach as a departure from the gradual pace that we saw during the last hiking cycle?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions.  We really haven\u2019 t.  And , and what I can tell you now, though, is that we fully appreciate that this is a different situation.  If you look back to where we were in 2015, \u2019 16, \u201917, \u201918 when we were raising rates, inflation was very close to 2  percent , even below 2 percent .  Unemployment was , was not at our estimates of the natural rate.  And growth was, you know, in the 2 to 3 percent  range.  Right now , we have inflation running substantially above 2 perc ent and, and, you know, more persistently than we would like.  We have growth \u2014even in forecasts, even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022 \u2014we still see growth higher than, substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate.  And we see a labor market where, by so many measures, it is historically tight.  I think the \u2014you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is , is looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of  [the unemployment rate cons istent with] maximum employment.  If you look at things like quits and job openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you\u2019 re seeing \u2014and, and just the ratio of job openings to unemployed \u2014you\u2019 re seeing a very, very tight labor market.  Now, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower.  It \u2019s 1\u00bd percentage point s lower than it was in February of 2020.  Maybe a [full]  percentage point of    that is , is retirements.  Some part of those retirements are,  are, you know, rela ted to COVID rather than just regular retirements .  So we think there \u2019s, there \u2019s a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force.  But it\u2019 s not happening very quickly, and it may not \u2014it may continue to not happen very quickly as long as  the pandemic is on[going] .  So that \u2019s, that \u2019s, that\u2019s  how we think about that.  We haven \u2019t made \u2014to your specific question\u2014we really have not addressed those questions.  And we \u2019ll begin to address them as we\u2014 as we move into the March meeting and meetings after that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  I\u2019m wondering if you can talk to us about any metrics that the Fed  uses to assess how inflation affects different groups of Americans, especially lower -, lower -income earners?  And are you worried that the Fed underestimates, or can \u2019t effectively measure , the impact of inflation on some of the most vulnerable households?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So it \u2019s, it\u2019s more a matter of \u2014I think the problem that we \u2019re\u2014that we\u2019re  talking about here is really that people who are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck to paycheck, they\u2019 re spending most or all of their \u2014of, of what they \u2019re earning on food, gasoline, rent, heating their \u2014heating, things like that, basic necessities.  And so inflation right away, right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions.  So that \u2019s really the point.  I don\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m not aware of, you know, inflation literally falling more on, on different socioeconomic groups.  It\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s not the point.  The point is , some people are just really in  a\u2014prone to suffer more.  I mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn\u2019 t good.  It\u2019 s bad.  High inflation is , is bad, but they\u2019 re going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive    their cars and things like that.  It\u2019s more \u2014so that , that \u2019s really how I think  of it.  And, you know, we, we have to control inflation for the benefit of all Americans.  But part of \u2014part of it is just that it\u2019 s particularly hard on people with fixed incomes and low incomes who spent most of their\u2014of their income on necessities, which are \u2014which are  experiencing high inflation now\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Michelle , and t hank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question here.  So year over year, inflation \u2019s at a 40 -year high.  Th e [increase in] input costs for producer price index for all of 2021 was the highest on record.  Some investors fear that the Fed might be moving too late.  Now, you said no decisions were made on the path of rate hikes, but was a rate hike more than 25 ba sis points discussed today?  And as a follow to that \u2014because I have  problems with the mute button \u2014as a follow to that, you testified that the supply chain issues could be worked out by the end of the year.  You talked about that today.  The CEO of Ford, though, told Fox Business today that the chip shortage will last into 2023.  So today you said inflation will start to ease this year.  I want to drill down and get a timeline that you see as to when we could see that relief.  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I , I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to be completely worked out by the end of this year.  I do not expect the m, and I have not expected them.  What I would say , and I have been saying,  is that I expect progress to be made in the second half of this year, mainly \u2014progress because we\u2019 re not making much progress.  If you look at a ton of metrics, you can find some th at suggest that delivery times are shorter and inventories in some industries moving up.  But, overall, we \u2019re not \u2014we \u2019re not making progress.  And, you know, things like the semiconductor issue a re going to \u2014they \u2019re going to be quite a long time.  I would th ink they\u2019 ll go more than through 2023.    In terms of \u2014so in terms of being too late, I would just say this.  We\u2014our policy needs to be positioned to address the full range of plausible outcomes, as I said, and particularly the possibility that inflation will continue to run higher, more persistently than we \u2019d expected.  And we think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that, and, and we \u2019re committed to doing that.  And that \u2019s, that\u2019s really where we are.  In terms of your , your  question about the , the size of rate increases, we haven \u2019t\u2014we haven\u2019t  faced those decisions.  We haven \u2019t made them.  It isn \u2019t possible to sit down here today and tell you with any confidence what the \u2014what the  precise path will be.  But in \u2014as we work our way through this , meeting by meeting, we are aware that this is a very different, different  expansion, as I \u2019ve said a couple times, with higher inflation, higher growth, a much stronger economy.  And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in \u2014in the policy that we implement.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I \u2019d like to sort of weave some of the strands of your answers together and ask you, as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is. Are you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2  percent ?  Do you want to go below 2 percent  so that, on average, you get a 2 percent  inflation rate?  And because you said we have to protect the employment part of your mandate, i s there some sort of circuit breaker that would stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, no.  There \u2019s no\u2014there \u2019s nothing in our framework about having inflation run below 2 percent  so that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome.  So the answer to that is , is \u201cno.\u201d  What we\u2019 re trying to do is get inflation, keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2  percent .  That \u2019s, that\u2019s  always the , the ultimate goal.  And we do that in the    service of having inflation \u2014we get to that goal by having inflation average 2 percent  over time.  And if inflation doesn\u2019 t average 2  percent  over time, then it \u2019s not clear why inflation expectations would be anchored at 2  percent .  So that , that\u2019s the way we think about tha t.  You know, it \u2014what was the last part of your \u2014of your  question?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: I was asking if you\u2019 re protecting the employment side of the mandate, whether there \u2019s some sort of circuit breaker there.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Nothing like that.  I mean, I would s ay you have a tremendously strong labor market.  And you have growth this year at \u2014forecast to be well above \u2014well above potential.  I mean, people who are forecasting growth think potential growth is around 2  [percent].  Most forecasts [of actual growth] ar e significantly above that for 2022, and that \u2019s even with, with  policy becoming substantially less accommodative.  So the labor market\u2019 s going to be strong for some time. We\u2019re \u2014ideally , what we \u2019re trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent .  And we \u2019re trying to do that in a process that , that, that  accomplishes\u2014you know, that will also leave the labor market in a very strong position.  And no one really knows what that will take.  Again, I would say that it isn \u2019t just monetary policy  that\u2019s helping inflation get down.  It\u2019 ll be supply- side improvements, and it \u2019ll be less, les s fiscal, you know, less fiscal impulse in all likelihood.  So\u2014but monetary policy will do our job.  It is our job to get inflation down to 2  percent .  And a situa tion where , where  the two goals are \u2014the two goals can be in tension is a difficult one.  But I \u2014but I  don\u2019 t really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant threat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher pa rticipation over time is high inflation.  And also, high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these large r wage    increases that we\u2019 re seeing now.  So we do hope to achieve , and our plan is to achieve , both of those goals.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I co uld\u2014 if I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too much as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being more forecast dependent in making decisions , rather than the state dependency you\u2019 ve been using as a framework for the last year and a half or so?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: State dependency was particularly around the thought that if we \u2014if we saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflatio n\u2014actual inflation before we tightened.  And so that was a very state -dependent thought because, for a long time, we \u2019d been tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared.  And that was the case for , for a number of years.  So in thi s particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring incoming data as well as the evolving outlook.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you for taking my question.  I want to ask you, with the benefit of hindsight, and I real ize, I mean, that is what it is.  But do you feel that, you know, monetary policy and fiscal policy maybe did too much to react to the crisis and that part of the inflation problem that we \u2019re having right now is because the government response, you know, collectively was more than what the economy ended up needing?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I think it \u2019s too soon to write that history, really.  But what I would say is this.  The\u2014if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the global  economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy, and people going to their homes for weeks on end in  masks, and there are no vaccines , and it could be a really long    time to get them, you know .  And then, you know, you have \u2014economic activity  drops by a shocking amount in one \u2014so there was a real risk of lasting damage.  And I think Congress responded remarkably with the \u2014with the  CARES Act, incredibly timely  and very powerful.  People will \u2014there \u2019ll always be flaws in these things.  B ut in real time, it was a remarkable achievement.  And we responded.  And what we were able to do was, you know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what really needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress enabled with the CARES  Act.  So now, that was a lot of \u2014that was a lot .  And what we did was a lot.  And, you know, now\u2014so , what we have now is , we have the strongest recovery of any, any  country.  And we have \u2014we have  a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we \u2019ve had, because we\u2019ve, we \u2019ve put so much support behind the recovery.  And we \u2019re managing the , the relatively high- class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and a labor shortage.  So \u2014and these are serious problems, very serious problems that we , you know, we \u2019re working as hard as we can  on. Was it too much?  Again, I \u2019m going to leave that to the historians .  And\u2014but look, i n 25 years, we \u2019ll look back at this incident, which will be a, you know, 2- , 3-, 4-, 5-year period.  And we \u2019ll say, you know, we \u2019ll have  a\u2014we\u2019ll have  a much better basis to make a judgment about the actions that people took.  But it was all founded, though, in a \u2014in a  very strong reaction to a , you know, to a unique historical event.  And I guess I \u2019ll have to leave it at that.  I look for \u2014I hope I \u2019ll be around to see how that looks in 25 years.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks, Michelle.  Chair Powell, some investors are expecting the yield curve could flatten , or even invert , after rate hikes begin.  Would that worry you, and how important is that risk in the Fed\u2019s considera tion for adjusting policy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we , we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don\u2019 t control the slope of the yield curve.  Many flat \u2014many factors influence longer -term interest rates.  But it is something that we watch, and , and  you w ill know that from when we had this issue a few years ago.  And we take it into account , along with many other financial conditions , as we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  one thing I would say. Another is, currently, you\u2019 ve got a slope.  If you think about 2s  to 10s, 2- year Treasury to 10-year Treasury, I think that \u2019s around 75 basis points.  That \u2019s well within the range of a normal \u2014of a normal  yield -curve slope.  So it \u2019s something we \u2019re monitoring.  We don \u2019t think of it as\u2014I don\u2019 t think of it as some kind of an iron law.  But we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what it \u2019s telling us.

Or would it be driven by a much broader set of factors?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: We\u2019 d\u2014that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a good question in, in  real time.  Obviously, U.S. long- term sovereign debt is an \u2014is an  important global asset.  And it \u2014and the fact that our rates are so much higher than , than other risk -free sovereign rates around the world may put something of a ceiling on our \u2014on our  rates.

Within the context of just the broad effort to normalize rates, wo uld you describe what you want to do as a gradual hiking?  And then, secondly, within the context of hiking cycles, it \u2019s often the talking point for financial stability and wanting to make sure that asset bubbles don\u2019 t emerge.  Is that something that has a lso factored into the conversation as you start to think about hiking rates?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I would describe what we \u2019re doing along these lines.  This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy that we put in place to deal with the \u2014with the  economic effects of the pandemic.  And that \u2019s going to involve a number of things.  It\u2019s going to involve and does involve finishing asset purchases.  It\u2019s going to involve lifting off.  And it \u2019s going to involve additional rate increases as appropriate.  And we , we have \u2014we \u2019re going to write down in March our next assessment of what that might be.  It \u2019s going to continue to evolve as the data evolve.  We need to be quite adaptable, I think, in our under standing of this.  The last thing we \u2019re going to do is , we\u2019re going to have a couple more meetings, I think, to talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and [to] do so in a predictable manner.  And that \u2019s, that\u2019s  something that we will also be doing as appropriate.  And I wouldn\u2019 t\u2014I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s possible to say exactly how this is going to go.  And we \u2019re, we\u2019re  going to need to be, as I \u2019ve mentioned, nimble about this.  And the economy is quite different this time.  I\u2019ve said this several times now.  The economy is quite different .  It\u2019s stronge r.  Inflation is higher.  The labor market is much, much stronger than it was.  And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year.

And what it shows is a number of , of positive aspects of financial stability.  But you mentioned, really , [the behavior of] asset prices is one of the four.  So asset prices are somewhat elevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing.  I don\u2019 t really think asset price s themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability, and that \u2019s because households are in good shape financially than they have been.  Businesses are in good shape financially.  Defaults on business loans are low and that kind of thing.  The  banks are highly capitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong.  There are some concerns in the\u2014 in the nonbank financial sector around \u2014still around money market funds, although the SEC is making\u2014has made some very positive proposals there .

Despite the strong economy, the recent rise in COVID cases will likely impact growth, with reduced spending in COVID-sensitive sectors and potential disruptions in the workforce.Health experts are optimistic that the Omicron variant will lead to a rapid decline in cases, potentially resulting in a return to strong economic growth. However, the overall impact on the economy remains uncertain, and the virus continues to cause significant hardship for many individuals and healthcare workers.Employers are struggling to fill job openings due to labor supply constraints, leading to a significant increase in wages. The aging population and retirements have contributed to subdued labor force participation, while pandemic-related factors and ongoing concerns about the virus have also kept some individuals out of the labor force. The current wave of the virus may further prolong these effects. Despite these challenges, there is optimism for future improvements in participation and employment. Inflation remains well above the desired goal of 2 percent, with supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and reopening of the economy contributing to elevated levels of inflation. Bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting the ability of production to meet the higher demand in the near term, and these issues have been more significant and long-lasting than expected, exacerbated by waves of the virus. While the initial drivers of higher inflation were connected to pandemic-related disruptions, price increases have now spread to a wider range of goods and services.The FOMC is attentive to the risks of excessive real wage growth putting upward pressure on inflation, but they expect inflation to decline over the year. They are committed to promoting a long expansion and preventing higher inflation, while also monitoring the economy's evolution and maintaining their mandate for maximum employment and stable prices.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plans to phase out asset purchases and raise the federal funds rate soon, while acknowledging the uncertain economic outlook and the need for flexibility in responding to unexpected developments. They also issued principles for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, clarifying that interest rates will be adjusted first and reductions will occur gradually through adjustments to reinvestments.The Federal Reserve is open to adjusting their approach to balance sheet management based on economic and financial developments, and will provide additional information on these matters in upcoming meetings. They acknowledge the impact of their actions on communities, families, and businesses, and are committed to achieving their goals of maximum employment and price stability.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Are rate hikes at consecutive meetings on the table this year? Is every meeting a live meeting? Would the Fed consider front-loading some rate hikes?\n'ANSWER': It is not possible to predict the exact path for policy rates. No decisions have been made about the path of policy. The Fed will be guided by incoming data and the evolving outlook, and will communicate transparently. The current economic conditions are different from 2015 and will impact the pace of policy adjustments. No further decisions have been made.", "'QUESTION': Would raising interest rates and moving to less accommodative financial conditions hurt the labor market?\n'ANSWER': There is room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market, as the current labor market is historically strong with record levels of job openings, quits, and rising wages. Other factors such as supply-side improvements and less supportive fiscal policy should also help bring down inflation. The timing and pace of these effects are uncertain, but the Fed is prepared to use tools to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.", "'QUESTION': What does \"significantly reducing\" the balance sheet holdings mean and are there other ways being considered to recalibrate the process? How much disagreement is there on the use of active sales or changes in reinvestments?\n'ANSWER': The Committee is currently discussing these questions and has established principles to guide their decisions. They will spend more time on this topic in future meetings and provide additional information when appropriate. The balance sheet is larger and has a shorter duration compared to the last cycle, and the stronger economy and higher inflation may lead to moving sooner and faster. The primary means of adjusting monetary policy is through changes in the federal funds rate, and the balance sheet should decline predictably by adjusting reinvestments.", "'QUESTION': How should we think about the relationship between raising rates and reducing the balance sheet in terms of tightening monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': The balance sheet is seen as moving predictably in the background, while the federal funds rate is the active tool. There are rules of thumb equating passive runoff to rate increases, but there is uncertainty around the balance sheet's impact. The plan is to announce the timing, pace, and composition of balance sheet adjustments in advance, with interest rates remaining the active tool. Further discussions on size, pace, and composition will take place in upcoming meetings.", "QUESTION: Does the recent volatility in financial markets concern the Federal Reserve and could it impact their policy trajectory?\n\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve's main focus is on the real economy and achieving maximum employment and price stability. They consider financial conditions in relation to these goals and look at broader conditions rather than individual markets. They assess whether any changes in financial conditions are persistent and significant enough to affect their goals. The Fed believes their communication with the markets is effective, as reflected in market expectations and pricing. Monetary policy works through expectations, so this is considered appropriate.", "'QUESTION': What are the benchmarks for subsequent rate increases after the initial interest rate increase?\n'ANSWER': The decision on benchmarks for subsequent rate increases has not been made yet and will be made at the March meeting. The Committee is inclined to raise the federal funds rate in March if conditions are appropriate, but they are monitoring risks, especially global risks, and expect temporary softening in the economy from Omicron. They anticipate the underlying strength of the economy to rebound quickly.", "'QUESTION': Do you still think that the December SEPs narrative of inflation coming down without the federal funds rate going over the estimate of neutral is credible?\n'ANSWER': The path of policy is highly uncertain, but we are committed to using our tools to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched. Factors such as fiscal policy, relief on the supply side, and less accommodative monetary policy will contribute to a decline in inflation. We will react accordingly if the economy and inflation deviate from our expectations. Our policy takes into account the differences in the current economy compared to the last tightening cycle.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide any insight into the discussion or staff presentation on the reaction function surrounding the balance sheet?\n'ANSWER': The last paragraph of the balance sheet principles states that the Committee is prepared to adjust any details based on economic and financial developments. This is a general statement and not a hint, as events may require amendments to the principles. The timing and pace of reducing the balance sheet will be determined after the process of raising rates begins. The balance sheet is larger than necessary and will be gradually shrunk in an orderly and predictable manner. The specific timing and details have not been decided yet.", "QUESTION: What are the risks to the elusive soft landing and can Fed policy be a risk?\n\nANSWER: The risks to a soft landing include prolonged high inflation and the possibility of inflation moving even higher. The Fed must be prepared to address different outcomes, including the scenario where inflation remains elevated. Other risks include ongoing COVID-19 developments and potential disruptions in supply chains. Chair Powell cannot provide information on the dates of transactions by Robert Kaplan and has asked the inspector general to conduct an investigation.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide an update on your thinking regarding inflation and whether it has changed since the last projection in December? How do you expect to achieve the deceleration in inflation from the current level to the target by the end of the year?\n\n'ANSWER': Inflation has remained about the same but slightly worse since the December meeting. I would personally raise my estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation by a few tenths today. If the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address it. We are considering moving away from highly accommodative policy and eventually to a policy that is not accommodative. Fiscal policy will provide less growth impulse this year, and relief on the supply side will eventually come. However, the risk of high inflation being more persistent has increased. Our objective is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent while supporting a healthy labor market. The labor market is currently strong, but there is a shortage of workers. We acknowledge the uncertainty of the outlook and will adapt and communicate accordingly.", "'QUESTION': Does the possibility of raising interest rates by large increments and doing a 50 basis point hike indicate a departure from the gradual pace of the last hiking cycle?\n'ANSWER': We haven't made those decisions yet. The current situation is different from previous rate hikes. Inflation is above 2%, growth is higher than the potential rate, and the labor market is historically tight. We haven't addressed those specific questions yet and will discuss them in upcoming meetings.", "'QUESTION': Can you discuss the metrics the Fed uses to assess how inflation affects different groups of Americans, particularly lower-income earners, and if there are concerns about underestimating or effectively measuring the impact on vulnerable households?\n\n'ANSWER': The issue is that people on fixed or low incomes who spend most of their earnings on basic necessities like food, rent, and heating are immediately affected by inflation. It's not about different socioeconomic groups, but rather the vulnerability of certain individuals. While high inflation is bad for everyone, it disproportionately affects those with fixed or low incomes who rely on necessities experiencing high inflation.", "'QUESTION': Was a rate hike more than 25 basis points discussed today and when can we expect relief from inflation?\n'ANSWER': No decisions were made on the size of rate increases and it is not possible to provide a precise timeline for relief from inflation. Progress is expected in the second half of this year, but supply chain issues, such as the semiconductor shortage, may persist beyond 2023. The Fed is prepared to make policy changes to address higher inflation.", "'QUESTION': What is the goal of the Federal Reserve as they start to reverse policy and raise interest rates? \n'ANSWER': The goal of the Federal Reserve is to keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. They aim to achieve this by having inflation average 2 percent over time. If inflation does not average 2 percent over time, it is not clear why inflation expectations would be anchored at 2 percent.", "QUESTION: Are there any measures in place to protect the employment side of the mandate?\n\nANSWER: There are no specific measures in place to protect employment, but the labor market is currently strong and expected to remain so. The focus is on achieving a 2% inflation rate while keeping the labor market in a strong position, which may require supply-side improvements and less fiscal impulse. High inflation poses a threat to further strengthening in the labor market and diminishes the benefits of wage increases. The goal is to achieve both inflation and employment objectives.", "'QUESTION': Should the Federal Reserve go back to being more forecast dependent in making decisions instead of relying on state dependency?\n'ANSWER': State dependency was based on the idea of waiting for actual inflation before tightening policy. In the past, the Fed had tightened based on the expectation of high inflation that never materialized. In the current situation, the Fed will closely monitor incoming data and the outlook.", "'QUESTION': Do you feel that monetary and fiscal policy did too much in response to the crisis, leading to the current inflation problem?\n\n'ANSWER': It's too soon to say, but at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a real risk of lasting damage to the economy. Congress responded remarkably with the CARES Act, which helped prevent a collapse of the financial system. Now we have a strong recovery, but also face high inflation and a labor shortage. Only time will tell if the response was too much.", "'QUESTION': Would the flattening or inversion of the yield curve worry the Fed and how important is that risk in their policy considerations?\n'ANSWER': The Fed monitors the yield curve slope but does not control it. They consider many factors, including the yield curve, when assessing the economic outlook. Currently, the slope is within a normal range, so it is something they monitor but not seen as an iron law.", "'QUESTION': Can an inverted yield curve be attributed to U.S. fundamentals or is it influenced by broader factors?\n'ANSWER': It is difficult to determine in real time. The high rates of U.S. long-term sovereign debt compared to other risk-free sovereign rates globally may limit our rates. The impact of an inverted yield curve would depend on the specific circumstances at that time.", "'QUESTION': Would you describe the current rate normalization as a gradual hiking? And are you considering financial stability and preventing asset bubbles in the conversation about hiking rates?\n\n'ANSWER': We are gradually moving away from highly accommodative monetary policy implemented during the pandemic. This involves finishing asset purchases, lifting off, and appropriate rate increases. Our next assessment in March will consider evolving data. We will also discuss allowing the balance sheet to run off predictably. Financial stability concerns are part of our policy considerations.", "'QUESTION': Was the discussion today about worries of asset bubbles emerging as a result of easy rates?\n'ANSWER': Asset prices are somewhat elevated, reflecting a high risk appetite, but they do not represent a significant threat to financial stability. Households and businesses are in good financial shape, banks are highly capitalized, and there are manageable concerns in the nonbank financial sector."]}
