Mr. Chairman, when you cut rates in July, you characterized it as  a \u201cmidcycle adjustment .\u201d  Is that still your view of what \u2019s happening?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP, we see a favorable economic outlook, with continued moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective .  And , by the way, that view is consistent with those of many other forecasters.  As you can see, FOMC participants generally think that these positive economic outcomes will be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate .  At the last press conference, I pointed to two episodes in , I guess , 1995 and 1998 as examples of such an approach, which was successful in both of those instances .  As our statement also highlights , though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments .  And if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate .  We don\u2019 t see that \u2014it\u2019s not what we expect \u2014but we would certainly follow that path if it became appropriate .  In other words, as we say in our statement, we will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we will act as appropriate to help ensure that the ex pansion remains on track.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: [ Inaudible remark ]  I\u2019m  sorry .  Rich Miller with Bloomberg .  Taking the statement, your opening remarks, and the SEP,  I \u2019m just wondering what kind of message we should take from this.  Do you still \u2014does the FOMC \u2014is it safe to say the  FOMC still has an easing bias or not?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So the idea of having a bias is something that was a longtime practice, and we don \u2019t actually have that practice anymore, so I can \u2019t really adopt it right here .  But, nonetheless, I \u2019ll respond to your question.  So we did\u2014we made one decision today, and   that decision was to lower the federal funds rate by \u00bc percentage point .  We believe that action is appropriate to promote our objectives, of course .  We\u2019re going to be highly data dependent, as always.  Our decisions are going to depend on the implications of incoming information for the outlook, and I would also say, as we often do, that we \u2019re not on a preset course.  So that \u2019s how we\u2019re going to look at it .  We\u2019re going to be care fully looking at economic data .  Sometimes the path ahead is clear and sometimes less so .  So we \u2019re going to be looking carefully, meeting by meeting , at the full range of information, and we \u2019re going to assess the appropriate stance of policy as we go.  A nd, as I said, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could just follow up, you\u2019 ve also said that the favorable outlook is predicated on financial conditions, and the financial conditions are in tur n predicated on an outlook for F ed policy\u2014 in this case, further cuts .  Wouldn\u2019 t that suggest that you should be inclined to\u2014if you want those financial conditions and that favorable outlook to come about, you should be inclined to cut?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, what we do going f orward is very much going to depend, Rich, on the flow of data and information.  We\u2019ve seen \u2014you know, if you look at the things we \u2019re monitoring, particularly global growth and trade development s, global growth has continued to weaken .  I think it \u2019s weaken ed since our last meeting .  Trade developments have been up and down and then up, I guess \u2014or back up, perhaps \u2014over the course of this intermeeting  period .  In any case, they \u2019ve been quite volatile .  So we do see those risks as actually more heightened now .  We\u2019re going to be watching that carefully.  We \u2019re also going to be watching the U.S . data quite carefully, and we \u2019ll have to make an assessment as we go.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  I know you\u2019 re trying to speak for the C ommittee when you do these press conferences,   but the C ommittee is clearly divided right now, at least about the outlook and the appropriate policy path.  Some people think you need to wait and see the labor market and the consumer  crack or weaken further before acting more aggressively, and some people think that by the time that happens, you\u2019 ll need to do even more aggressive action to arrest a downturn.  Where do you stand on this?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, let me just say, on the general point of diverse perspectives, you\u2019re right .  Sometimes the \u2014and there have been many of those times in my now almost eight years at the Fed, many times when the direction i s relatively clear and it \u2019s relatively  easy to reach unanimity.  This is a time  of difficult judgments and, as you can see, disparate perspectives.  And I really do think that \u2019s nothing but healthy, and so I see a benefit in having those diverse perspectives , really .  So your question, though, is?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  This is to your own view , because the data is, to some extent , lagged, especially when you have these risks on the horizon, and the markets obviously think that these risks could materialize more than what you and your colleagues are projecting in the dot plot today.  So, I w onder, where are your own views about the tension between risk management, which implies some degree of data independence, and this idea of being data dependent \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Yes.  S o I\u2019ll try to get at that this way .  I think that the idea that if you s ee trouble approaching on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can\u2014I think that \u2019s a good idea in principle , and I think history teaches us that it \u2019s better to be proactive in adjusting policy if you can. I think applying that principle in a particula r situation is where the challenge comes.  So I told you where  the C ommittee \u2014the bulk of the Committee is going , meeting by meeting, and I think the main takeaway is that this is a C ommittee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly,   consistently , through the course of the year to support economic activity as it has  felt that it \u2019s appropriate .  At the beginning of the year we were looking at further rate increases, then we were patient, and then we cut once, then we cut again.  And I think you\u2019 ve seen u s being willing to move based on data, based on the evolving risk picture , and I have no reason to think that will change .  I think \u2014but it will continue to be data dependent, and depend\u2014data  includes the evolving risk picture .  That \u2019s where I am, and that \u2019s where I think the bulk of the C ommittee is.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr . Chairman, I wonder if  you\u2019 re\u2014oh, sorry.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  I \u2019ve only done this a dozen \u2014a lot of times .  I wonder if you\u2019 re concerned about how the Federal Reserve operated through the re cent liquidity crunch in markets .  We talked to many traders who said the tax date payment was known well in advance .  There were several reports of people pointing to September as a potential crunch time .  You closed Monday at the top end of the fed funds  rate.  Tuesday came along, and ther e wasn \u2019t an operation until nine  o\u2019clock  and no announcement until \u2014of a second operation until four o\u2019clock in the afternoon.  Was the F ed listening to markets well ahead of time, going back a year when there were blowouts in the overnight rate at year -end and the turn of the year?  Are you concerned about how, for example, the New York F ed operated through this?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, so I would say I doubt that anyone is closer to and has more invested in carefully following the \u2014you know, the behavior of these markets .  So, of course, we were well aware of the \u2014you know, the tax payments and also of the settlement of the large bond purchases .  And, you know, we were very much waiting for that .  But we didn\u2019 t expect \u2014the response to that was stronger than we expected .  And, by the way, our sense is that it surprised market participants a lot , too.  You know , people were writing about this and publishing stories about it weeks ago .  It wasn \u2019t a surprise, but it was \u2014it was  a stronger response   than\u2014certainly than we expected .  So, no, I \u2019m not concerned about that , to answer your question.  I can go on a little bit about how we \u2019re looking at that .  Why don\u2019 t I do that?  So, as I mentioned, it doesn\u2019 t\u2014we don \u2019t see this as havin g any implications for the broader economy or for the economic outlook, n or for our ability to control rates .  The strains in the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I think most folks anticipated \u2014strong demand for cash to purchase T reasuries and pay corporate taxes.  We took appropriate actions to address those pressures, to keep the fed funds rate within the target range, and those measures were successful .  If we experience another episode of pressures in money markets, we have the tools to address those pressures.  We will not hesitate to use them . And since we \u2019re talking about this, let me take a step back and say this.  Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the C ommittee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime.  And we \u2019ve been operating in that regime for a full decade .  We think it works well to implement our rate decisions .  The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered rates\u2014 the IOER and RRP rates\u2014to keep the fed fund rates in the target range.  It \u2019s designed specifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that purpose .  So, going forward, we \u2019re going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we\u2019 re going to be assessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organi c growth of our balance sheet .  And I \u2019m sure we\u2019 ll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting  period and certainly at our next meeting.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Could  I just follow up here quickly?  D o you think you\u2019 ve underestimated the amount of reserves necessary for the banking system\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So we \u2019ve always said that it \u2019s\u2014that the level is uncertain, right ?  And that \u2019s something we \u2019ve tried to be very clear about .  And as you know, we \u2019ve invested lots of time talking to many of the large holde rs of reserves to assess their \u2014what they say is their demand for reserves.  We try to assess what that is.  We \u2019ve tried to combine all of that together .  We put it out so the public can react to it.  But , yes, there \u2019s real uncertainty, and it is certainly possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought .  That \u2019s always been a possibility, and it certainly is now .  Again, we \u2019ll be looking at this carefully in coming days and taking it up at the next meeting\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times .  Earlier this year \u2014or, actually , in September, the G overnors \u2019 Board put out a research paper looking\u2014trying to quantify trade uncertainty.  A nd it suggested that it could drag through the busine ss investment channel on growth as much as a percentage point over the course of the next year .  How much  confidence do you have in the F ed\u2019s ability to estimate the real effects of trade uncertainty ?  And if you have confidence in that paper, it would see m to suggest a \u2014sort of a more aggressively dovish path than the one that you \u2019ve chosen.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Yes.  So I thin k to provide a little context, F ed economists do research all the time .  It\u2019s generally of  very high quality.  It \u2019s their research .  It\u2019s not an official finding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System .  It\u2019s just \u2014and, by the way, they put it out for public review so that you can see their econometrics, so you can see all of it \u2014their whole work is exposed to critique by the whole profession.  So it \u2019s a great tradition that we have .  And, you know, what this particular piece of work did is , it went after measuring trade   policy uncertainty through a couple of channels , including concerning tariffs, also concerning the threat of more tariffs, and it looked deeply at the data to try to assess the effects on output .  And while I would say, directly answering your question, there \u2019s real uncertainty around these \u2014around these effects.  It\u2019 s a $22 trillion  economy.  T o try to isolate  the effects of certain things is  very challenging, but we do the best we can.  So \u2014and this piece of research found significant effects, and that \u2019s frankly consistent with a number of other research projects that economists have undertaken.  It \u2019s also cons istent with what we \u2019ve been hearing in the Beige B ook.  So, I mean , I think if you take a step back from that, we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an effect .  You see it in weak business investment, weak exports \u2014hard to quantify it precisely , though\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters.  I was struck by the sort of anchored median federal funds rate here through 2020, and that in comparison to the fact that you now have sort of three very discrete groups of opinions around where the  fed funds rate is heading.  A nd I wondered, is it fair to say that the \u2014those opinions have become sort of firmer in their conviction, and that it \u2019s going to take some sort of real material change in the outlook now for that to move in either direction \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  And you\u2019 re asking specifically about 2020?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Fair enough, but if \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Particularly, if you look at 2020, I think the use of this is , individual participants write down their forecast s.  It should give you a sense of how people are thinking about the likely path of the economy and the appropriate path for mone tary policy in that individual person\u2019 s thinking, and I think that \u2019s a good thing to know .  I think I \u2019d be very reluctant to look at it as hardened views or a prediction , really.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: But just to follow  up, if I could.  T here were a number of  arguments in July around the reason for cutting rates .  Have any of those gotten substantially weaker or changed around the table?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, well , I think , if you look at the U.S.\u2014look at the U.S . economy, the U.S . economy has generally per formed roughly as expected \u2014roughly:   The consumer is spending at a healthy clip,  I \u2019d say business fixed investment and exports have weakened further, and I \u2019d say the manufacturing PMI suggests more weakness ahead .  The labor market is still strong , though, s o generally that is the same .  I think if you look at \u2014the global economy, I think , has weakened further in the EU and China, and I think, you know, trade policy developments have been a big mover of markets and of sentiment during that inter meeting  period.  So that \u2019s why I think what \u2019s\u2014that \u2019s what \u2019s happened over the inter meeting  period, and, you know, different people around the table have different perspectives as you obviously know\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times .  I\u2019m just curious on your balance sheet point .  You talked about the C ommittee thinking about   resuming organic growth, you know, over time .  I guess the question is, if you have shrunk your balance sheet maybe just a little bit too small to the point that reserves are too scarce to get through sort of these unusual periods, is organic growth in the balance sheet enough to get back to a point of ample reserves that can get us through those tough times , or would you need to see something a little b it above that ?  And is that a possibility the Committee would consider?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, I think it \u2019s hard to deal with every hypothetical possibility.  I think , for the foreseeable future, we \u2019re going to be looking at, if needed, doing the sorts o f things that we did the last two days \u2014these temporary open market operations .  That will be the tool that we use .  And the question will be , then\u2014as we go through quarter -end, as we learn more, you know, what really \u2014how much of this really has to do with the level of reserves?   And I think we \u2019ll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Victoria Guida  with Politico .  Another money market question.  You know, banks have been pointing to liquidity rules as having contributed to some of the volatility we \u2019ve seen in repo markets and, you know, potentially some capital rules as well .  Are you all looking at whether, you know, some tweaks to the liquidity coverage ratio might help ?  And, also , what is the status of the net  stable funding ratio rul e?  Are you all still planning on putting that out soon?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, so I think if we concluded that we needed to raise the level of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we\u2019 d probably raise the level of reserves rather than lower the LCR.  I mean , it\u2019s not impossible that we would come to a view that the LCR is calibrated too high, but that \u2019s not something that we think right now .  On the other hand, it might be that more reserves are needed, in which case we are in a position to suppl y them .  In   terms of the net stable funding ratio, it \u2019s\u2014I believe we  put it out for comment and got comments, and I believe we \u2019re looking at \u2014at finalizing that in the relatively near future.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Just \u2014just  to follow up, I mean, in terms of twea ks to the LCR, I mean , there \u2019s also been some talk about potentially giving banks some room in times of stress to maybe dip into their liquidity buffers\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I think we want banks to, you know \u2014to use their liquidity buffers in times of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients as a general rule.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  So, about a month ago\u2014Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network .  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  About a month ago or so you said that there \u2019s no precedent to integrate trade uncertainty in to monetary policy.  In the last few weeks, have you figured out how to incorporate trade uncertainty \u2014and this level of trade uncertainty \u2014into monetary policy going forward ?  You\u2019ve  talked about uncertainty many times today\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So my point , really , was that \u2014to start , that trade pol icy is not the business of the F ed, it \u2019s the business of Congress and the A dministration .  But \u2014so why are we talking about it?  We \u2019re talking about it because anything tha t affects the achievement of our  goals can , in principle , be something that monetary policy should take into consideration.  And our discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that \u2019s weighing on the outlook.  So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can \u2019t address, really , is what businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade .  We can \u2019t do that .  We don\u2019t have that tool .  But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness , to some extent , by supporting demand through sound monetary policy.  A nd we think our policy tools support economic activity through fairly well -understood channels :  by reducing interest   burden and encouraging consumer purchase of durables , of homes , and other interest- sensitive items ; by creating broadly more accommodative financial conditions, which support spending and also investment by businesses ; and also by boosting household and business confidence .  So, you know, I don\u2019 t want to be heard to say that our tools don \u2019t have an effect .  They do.  B ut I was making the point that there is a piece of this that we really can \u2019t address.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  So have you figured out how to navigatge it?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, I think, yeah.  I mean , it\u2019s a challe nge.  There \u2019s no simple bottom -line answer where I can say, yes, I \u2019ve got it for you here .  But what it amounts to is this :  What you see is probably the kind of volatility that \u2019s typical of an important , complex, ongoing negotiation.  And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to the underlying forces, the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate .  We don\u2019 t\u2014we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements .  We\u2019re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum employment and stable prices.  So we need to look through what \u2019s a pretty volatile situation .  So that means not overreacting quickly.  It means not underreacting, too.  So t hat\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to do.  And, you know, I would say, the outlook is positive in the face of these crosswinds we\u2019 ve felt .  And so, to some extent , I do believe that our shifting to a more accommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook has remained favorable.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Fed funds \u2014Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television .  Fed funds futures t rading since the statement was released shows that investors still think that another rate cut is coming this year .  On their behalf, let me ask, what is going to guide Fed policy to either pull them towards where the dot plot suggests no more moves this year or   keep them in place ?  Are you reacting to data now?  Are you reacting to your gut feeling about what trade tweets might mean?  Should they just watch for Jay Powell speeches to decide what \u2019s going to ha ppen going forward?  What \u2019s the F ed\u2019s reaction f unction now?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Right .  So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the events that are going on around the world, we \u2019ll be looking at, you know, the evolving geopolitical events , we\u2019ll be looking at global growth, w e\u2019ll be looking at trade policy uncertainty.  Most importantly, we \u2019ll be looking at the performance of the U.S . economy.  We\u2019ll be looking for things that are affecting the outlook for the U.S . economy, particularly the outlook as it relates to maximum employment and stab le prices.  So all of those things in principle can affect the achievement of our goals .  It\u2019s an unusual situation , because, you know, the U.S . economy itself \u2014the largest part of it, the consumer part of it \u2014is in strong shape .  The manufacturing part, les s so.  But , overall, you see an economy that \u2014I think , generally , forecasts show  growth similar to our own, forecasts coming in about 2 percent, which is a good, solid year.  So the difference here is, we have significant , really , risks to that outlook from not just the geopolitical events , but also from slowing global growth and tra de policy uncertainty.  So we \u2019ll be looking at all of that and also financial market conditions and how they are affecting the outlook.  I can \u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a challenging time, I admit it, but we really have to be open to all those things .  We \u2019re not on a preset course .  We\u2019re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting as we see this, and , you know, we \u2019ll try to be as transparent as we can as we go.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Donna Borak.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Donna Borak with CNN.  With the rate cut today and potentially another modest adjustment coming down the road, do  you worry about lessening the F ed\u2019s firepo wer should there be a recession?  A nd is there any   scenario in which you would envision rates drifting lower into negative territory?  A nd are there any other tools that you could use before having to go there?  Thanks\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, in terms of firepower, I think the general principle, as I mentione d earlier, is , it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn gains momentum, and then\u2014so there \u2019s a fair amount of research that would show that that \u2019s the case.  Now, I think that principle need s to be applied carefully to the situation at hand.  Wha t we believe we\u2019 re facing here\u2014what we th ink we \u2019re facing here is a situation which can be addressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate.  As I mentioned, we are  watching carefully to see whether that is the case.  If , in fact , the economy weakens more, then we \u2019re prepared to be aggressive, and we \u2019ll do so if it turns out to be appropriate.  You mentioned negative interest rates.  So negative interest rates is some thing that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.  We chose to \u2014after we got to the effective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large -scale asset purchases, and those were the two unconventional  monetary policy tools that we used extensively.  We feel that they worked fairly well.  We did not use negative rates .  And I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound\u2014again, not something we are expecting\u2014 then I think we would look at using large -scale asset purchases and forward guidance.  I do not think we \u2019d be looking at using negative rates.  I just don\u2019 t think those will be at the top of our list.  By the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy re view where we \u2019re looking through all of these questions about the longer -run framework \u2014the strategy , tools , and communications \u2014and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Don Lee  with the L.A. Times .  How much \u2014can you talk about the mechanism in which the two rate cuts will affect the real economy ?  And how much \u2014to what extent  will it offset the negative effects of the trade uncertainty and tensions\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first, we th ink monetary policy works with, as Friedman said , long and variable lags.  So I think the real effects will be felt over time.  But, you know, we think that l ower interest rates will reduce  interest burden for borrowers , so that interest -sensitive things like housing and durable goods and other things like that \u2014cars \u2014it supports purchases of those.  Just, again, broadly, more accommodative financial conditions \u2014higher asset prices.  T hat\u2019s\u2014the models and the data show  that that\u2019s another powerful channel.  I also think there \u2019s a confidence channel.  You see \u2014you see household and business confidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative.  So I think, through all of those channels , monetary policy works.  It isn \u2019t, you know, precisely the right tool for every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but , nonetheless, it broadly works, and, you know, we \u2019re going to use the tool  we have.  And if it comes to it, we \u2019ll use all of our tools .  So that \u2019s how we think it works and how we think it \u2019s working.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: And how much will it offset the trade  impact, do you think \n\nCHAIR POWELL: It \u2019s very hard to say.  It\u2019s \u2014you know, it\u2019 s tough to say.  We \u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll us e our tools to offset negative \u2014that\u2019s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable prices.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  I \u2019m Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, are you worried that the low interest rates are adding to , or could create a bubble of ,   consumer and corporate debt that could make it more difficult for , especially , consumers to recover from the next recession or survive the next recession\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  You know, so, if you look at \u2014if you actually look at households, households are in very strong shape.  They\u2019 re less levered.  They \u2019ve got less debt.  They\u2019 ve got more income relative to their interest requirements.  And they \u2019re in very good shape \u2014much better shape than they were in before the financial crisis.  So the household sector as a sort of aggregate matter is in very good shape.  That doesn\u2019 t mean that every single person in the household sector is in good shape, but , overall , it\u2019s really not a concern.  The business sector is something that, you know, we \u2019ve talked about a lot and studied a lot, and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a high level.  However, so is the size of the business sector.  So, actually, the business sector itself is not materially higher leverage d tha n it was.  Nonetheless, there are a lot of highly levered companies, and that \u2019s the kind of thing that  happens during a long cycle when there aren \u2019t downturns for , now , into our 11th year.  You get \u2014you know, you do get that kind of phenomenon in a long cycle.  So that \u2019s something we \u2019re monitoring, and I think our view still is that that\u2019 s a real issue, but what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn.  It does  not have the makings of anything that w ould undermine the workings of the  financial system, for example, or itself create a shock that would turn the economy down.  It \u2019s more of \u2014it\u2019 s more of an amplifier.  We take it very seriously , though, and, you know, we \u2019re monitoring it carefully.  We\u2019re actually looking \u2014the Financial Stability Board is actually conducting a project right now to identify where these loans are held all around the world.  So it\u2019 s the subject of a lot of study and work, and, you know, we \u2019re trying to keep on top of it.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chairman Powell.  Greg Robb from Market Watch.  I \u2019m kind of hearing two things from you.  You\u2019 re saying that the economy is doing well, but there \u2019s this sense with people that the economy is actually s tarting to slow now .  And people are \u2014more and more , you talk\u2014there \u2019s talk  about recession, so you\u2014and even the F ed thinks the downside risks are rising.  So is the economy over  the next year \u2014between now and the end of next year , do you think GDP growth is going to hold s teady , and the unemployment rate \u2014could you talk about , just , how do you see the economy evolving over the next year?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, so, I think\u2014 and my colleagues and I , I think, all think that the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent.  And I think that \u2019s, by the way, widely shared among forecasters.  You know, the issue is more the risks to that.  You have downside risks here, and we\u2019ve talked about them.  It \u2019s that global growth will have an effect on U.S. growth over time \u2014 less so than for many other economies, but , still, there \u2019s a sector of our economy that \u2019s exposed to that.  Tra de policy uncertainty also has \u2014apparently has an effect.  So \u2014and you can see some weakness in the U.S. economy because of all that.  But , nonetheless \u2014so the job of monetary policy is to adjust both to e nsure against  those downside risks , but also to support the economy in light of the existing weakness that we do see.  So we \u2019re not \u2014as I mentioned , we\u2019re not \u2014we don\u2019t see a recession.  We\u2019 re not forecasting a recession.  But we are adjusting monetary policy in a more accommodative direction to try to support what is , in fact , a favorable outlook\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And the invert ed yield curve that we hear  is the b ond market signaling recession \u2014what do you\u2014is that\u2014so that \u2019s not \u2014that signal is not pe rtinent to you ?  Or where do you\u2014 \n\nCHAIR POWELL: No, we do \u2014so we monitor the yield curve carefully,  along with a large , wide range of financial conditions.  We don\u2019t \u2014so, it\u2019s not \u2014there \u2019s no one thing that is dispositive among all financial conditions.  The yield curve is something that we follow carefully.  And, again, based on our assessment of all the data, we still think it \u2019s a positi ve outlook.  The thing\u2014so , just to talk about the current situation, you see \u2014you saw long- term rates move down a whole lot and then retrace two -thirds of that move in the space of a few days.  So I think what really matters for all financial conditions gen erally is when there are changes\u2014material changes that are sustained for a period of time.  So\u2014but why are long -term rates low?  There are a number \u2014there can be a signal about expectations about growth there for sure, but there can also just be low  term premiums.  For example, just \u2014well, it can just be that there \u2019s this large quantity of negative -yielding and very low-yielding sovereign debt around the world, and, inevitably , that \u2019s exerting downward pressure on U.S. sovereign rates without really ne cessarily having an independent signal.  Nonetheless, that is a signal about weak global growth, probably, and weak global growth would affect us.  So global capital markets and the global economy are quite integrated, so this is something we  pay careful \u2014we\u2019re not going to be dismissive about the yield curve, but \u2014and I think you can tell, on the C ommittee , there \u2019s a range of views \u2014there are some who are very focused on the yield curve, others not so much.  You know, from my perspective, you watch it careful ly, and, you know, I think you need to be asking yourself a lot of questions if the yield curve is inverted as to why that is and how long it \u2019s sustained.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Chairman Powell.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  You mentioned trade poli cy being a complex, ongoing discussion.  What is your rule for stopping as far as interest rate cuts go?  You refer red to this as a \u201c midcycle adjustment. \u201d  The   median dot suggest s no more rate cuts, but, you know, if we get continued kind of back- and-forth  between the U.S. and China, trade policy uncertainty is going to remain heightened.  So, you know, under what circumstances would you say, \u201cY ou know what, I think we \u2019ve cut enough, we stop now \u201d?  And, secondly, as leader of this institution, have you felt  a need to take any steps to boost , like , employee morale at a time when the President  is constantly criticizing the F ed?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, I \u2019d love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward stopping rule, but it \u2019s really just goin g to be when we think we \u2019ve done enough.  A nd, you know, our eyes are open.  We \u2019re watching the situation.  We \u2019ve cut rates twice.  We\u2019 ve moved, really , through the course of this year, as I discussed, and , you know, we see ourselves as taking actions to sustain the expansion and thereby achieve our goals.  And if you look at sort of the things that are happening in the economy, I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion, because we really are reaching \u2014this positive economy is reaching communities that haven\u2019 t been reached in a long time.  There would be great benefit in having that last as long as possible, that\u2019s all.  So I don\u2019 t have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we \u2019re watching carefully, and there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we \u2019ve done enough, but there may also come a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively.  We don\u2019t know.  We \u2019re going to be watching things caref ully.

The Fed and your fellow central banks have been sort of exploring the far reaches of what \u2019s possible for monetary policy, even going so far as to make rates negative in some cases, with mixed results.  Meanwhile, fiscal and regulatory, not to mention trade , policy are pursuing their own separate courses.

Should you be more explicit about what monetary policy can and cannot do in this environment?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, we try to be clear about that , but, really, I think our job is to use our tools as best we can to achieve\u2014you know , to do the jobs that Congress has assigned us, which is achieve maximum employment and stable prices.

Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  Thanks for taking my question.  As we saw with falling yields , at least up until the beginning of this month, there \u2019s been a lot of demand for U.S. Treasuries, and even that was  partly maybe to blame for the liquidity crunch in  repo markets that we saw this week.  I mean, does the F ed have concerns over the impacts of a global glut for U.S. debt ?  Is that a conversation that you also   have with Treasury S ecretary Mnuchin \u2014about wha t the proper way to maybe address some of the challenges down the road with that type of , kind of , heavy interest globally?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Not really, no.

Global capital markets are highly integ rated, and, you know, our rates\u2014our long rates are definitely being pulled down by the very, very low rates that are abroad.  And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this :  that low rates abroad are a symbol \u2014or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, e xpectations of low inflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas about how to break out of that low equilibrium.  Now, that has implications for us.  You know, we\u2014in a world where economies and financial markets are tightly integrated, that matters for the U.S. economy.  So that \u2019s going to pull down U.S. rates, and U.S. financial conditions can tighten because of that.  And so I think we put all \u2014all of that goes into our thinking and into our   models.

However, business investment and exports have weakened due to slower growth abroad and trade policy uncertainty, leading to a decline in business fixed investment in the second quarter and continued softness in recent indicators.Despite a slight easing in the pace of job gains this year, the job market remains strong with low unemployment rates and solid job gains. Wages have also been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs, and the increase in labor force participation by people in their prime working years indicates a positive trend. This highlights the importance of sustaining the economic expansion to ensure that the strong job market benefits more individuals who have previously struggled to find work.The FOMC projects that the unemployment rate will remain below 4 percent in the coming years, while inflation continues to fall below the 2 percent target. Despite expectations of rising inflation, indicators suggest that inflation pressures remain low and there is concern that persistently low inflation could negatively impact longer-term inflation expectations. As a result, the FOMC has shifted its views on monetary policy towards a lower path for the federal funds rate in order to support the economic outlook, due to factors such as global growth weakness and trade policy uncertainty.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to lower the federal funds rate target by \u00c2\u00bc percent in response to global developments and muted inflation pressures. The future course of monetary policy will depend on economic developments and risks to the outlook, with projections showing only modest changes in the federal funds rate over the next couple of years.Funding pressures in money markets led to an increase in the effective federal funds rate, but these issues do not have any impact on the economy or monetary policy. To address these pressures, overnight repurchase operations were conducted, which effectively relieved funding pressures and are expected to bring the federal funds rate back into the target range.The Committee will closely observe incoming information to determine the future direction of the federal funds rate, taking necessary actions to support economic growth, maintain a robust labor market, and achieve the 2 percent inflation target.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Is the \"midcycle adjustment\" still the view of the FOMC?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC sees a positive economic outlook with moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near the 2 percent objective. They believe these outcomes can be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate. However, there are risks due to weak global growth and trade developments, and if the economy turns down, more rate cuts could be appropriate. The FOMC will continue to monitor developments closely and act as appropriate to support the expansion.", "'QUESTION': What kind of message should we take from the FOMC's statement, opening remarks, and SEP? Does the FOMC still have an easing bias?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC no longer has a bias, but they made the decision to lower the federal funds rate by \u00c2\u00bc percentage point. They will be highly data dependent and decisions will depend on incoming information. They are not on a preset course and will carefully assess the appropriate stance of policy as they go. They will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.", "'QUESTION': Shouldn't you be inclined to cut interest rates if you want favorable financial conditions and outlook?\n'ANSWER': Our decision on interest rates will depend on the flow of data and information. Global growth has weakened and trade developments have been volatile, increasing risks. We will closely monitor these factors and assess the U.S. data before making a decision.", "'QUESTION': Where does Chairman Powell stand on the divided perspectives within the Committee regarding the outlook and appropriate policy path?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Powell acknowledges the diverse perspectives within the Committee and sees it as a healthy aspect. He believes that having different viewpoints is beneficial. However, he does not directly address his own stance on the matter.", "'QUESTION': Where do you stand on the tension between risk management and being data dependent?\n'ANSWER': I believe it is important to be proactive in adjusting policy if trouble is approaching. The Committee has consistently shifted its policy stance throughout the year based on data and the evolving risk picture. We will continue to be data dependent, including considering the evolving risk picture.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about how the Federal Reserve operated through the recent liquidity crunch in markets?\n'ANSWER': We were aware of the tax payments and settlement of large bond purchases, but the response was stronger than expected. It surprised market participants as well. However, we don't see this as having implications for the broader economy or our ability to control rates. We have the tools to address any future pressures in money markets. We will closely monitor market developments and assess when it will be appropriate to resume organic growth of our balance sheet.", "'QUESTION': Do you think you've underestimated the amount of reserves necessary for the banking system?\n'ANSWER': We have always acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the level of reserves needed. We have engaged with major reserve holders to understand their demand and have considered all inputs. It is possible that we may need to resume balance sheet growth earlier than anticipated, which will be discussed at the next meeting.", "QUESTION: How confident is the Fed in estimating the real effects of trade uncertainty and does it support a more dovish path?\n\nANSWER: Fed economists conduct high-quality research, but their findings are not official. The research on trade uncertainty suggests significant effects on output, consistent with other studies and the Beige Book. However, quantifying the exact impact is challenging due to the size of the economy.", "'QUESTION': Is it fair to say that the opinions on the federal funds rate have become firmer and it will take a significant change in the outlook for it to move in either direction in 2020?\n\n'ANSWER': Yes, the opinions on the federal funds rate have become more solidified, and it would require a substantial change in the economic outlook for the rate to move in either direction in 2020.", "'QUESTION': What is the purpose of individual participants writing down their forecasts in the FOMC?\n'ANSWER': The purpose of individual participants writing down their forecasts is to provide insight into how people are thinking about the economy and monetary policy. It is not meant to be seen as hardened views or predictions, but rather as a way to understand individual perspectives.", "'QUESTION': Have any of the arguments for cutting rates in July gotten substantially weaker or changed?\n'ANSWER': The US economy has performed as expected, with strong consumer spending but weakened business fixed investment and exports. The manufacturing PMI suggests more weakness ahead. The global economy, particularly in the EU and China, has also weakened. Trade policy developments have been influential. Different perspectives exist among committee members.", "'QUESTION': Is organic growth in the balance sheet enough to get back to a point of ample reserves, or would the Committee consider something above that?\n'ANSWER': It's hard to deal with every hypothetical possibility, but for now, we will continue to use temporary open market operations as needed. We will assess the situation as we go through quarter-end and learn more about the impact of reserves. We expect to gain more insights in the next six weeks.", "'QUESTION': Are you considering making changes to the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio?\n'ANSWER': We may raise the level of required reserves for banks to meet the liquidity coverage ratio, but we do not currently believe that the ratio is too high. However, if more reserves are needed, we are able to provide them. As for the net stable funding ratio, we have received comments and are working towards finalizing it soon.", "'QUESTION': Is there any consideration to allowing banks to dip into their liquidity buffers during times of stress?\n'ANSWER': Banks are encouraged to use their liquidity buffers during times of stress instead of pulling back from the markets and their clients, as it is preferred for them to serve their clients and maintain market stability.", "'QUESTION': Have you figured out how to incorporate trade uncertainty into monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': Trade policy is not the Fed's responsibility, but anything that affects our goals can be considered. Our discussions and research suggest that trade policy is weighing on the outlook. While we can't provide a settled roadmap for international trade, our monetary policy tools can support economic activity through various channels such as reducing interest burden, encouraging consumer purchases, creating accommodative financial conditions, and boosting confidence. However, there is a piece of this issue that we can't address.", "'QUESTION': Have you figured out how to navigate the volatility in trade negotiations?\n'ANSWER': It's a challenge and there's no simple answer. We need to look through the volatility and react to the underlying forces relevant to our mandate. We're not involved in setting trade policy, but our accommodative stance has helped maintain a positive outlook amid the crosswinds.", "'QUESTION': What is going to guide Fed policy to either pull them towards where the dot plot suggests no more moves this year or keep them in place?\n'ANSWER': The Fed will be looking at data, evolving geopolitical events, global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and the performance of the U.S. economy. They will be considering factors that affect the outlook for maximum employment and stable prices. They will also assess financial market conditions and remain open to all these factors, making decisions meeting by meeting.", "QUESTION: Do you worry about lessening the Fed's firepower should there be a recession and is there any scenario in which you would envision rates drifting lower into negative territory? And are there any other tools that you could use before having to go there?\n\nANSWER: It can be a mistake to hold onto firepower until a downturn gains momentum. We believe the current situation can be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate. If the economy weakens further, we are prepared to be aggressive. We did not use negative rates during the financial crisis and would likely use large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance if needed. A monetary policy review is underway and expected to be completed next year.", "'QUESTION': How will the two rate cuts affect the real economy and offset the negative effects of trade uncertainty and tensions?\n'ANSWER': Lower interest rates will reduce the interest burden for borrowers, supporting purchases of housing, durable goods, and cars. Accommodative financial conditions and higher asset prices also play a role. Monetary policy works through various channels, including a confidence channel, and while it may not address every negative impact, it broadly works and the Fed will use all available tools.", "'QUESTION': And how much will it offset the trade impact, do you think?\n'ANSWER': It's very hard to say. We'll use our tools to offset negative effects. The job of monetary policy is to offset factors that hinder maximum employment and stable prices.", "'QUESTION': Are low interest rates contributing to a potential bubble of consumer and corporate debt that could hinder recovery from the next recession?\n\n'ANSWER': Household debt is low and income is high relative to interest requirements, so the overall household sector is in good shape. The business sector has high debt relative to GDP, but the size of the sector has also increased. Highly leveraged companies are a concern, but they are not expected to undermine the financial system or cause a shock to the economy. The issue is being closely monitored.", "'QUESTION': How do you see the economy evolving over the next year?\n'ANSWER': The most likely case is for continued moderate growth, strong labor market, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent. However, there are downside risks such as global growth and trade policy uncertainty that could weaken the economy. Monetary policy is being adjusted to support the favorable outlook and ensure against these risks. No recession is forecasted.", "'QUESTION': Is the inverted yield curve signaling a recession and is it relevant to the Federal Reserve?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve monitors the yield curve along with a wide range of financial conditions. While the yield curve is important, it is not the sole determinant of the economic outlook. The recent movement in long-term rates may not necessarily indicate a recession, as it could be influenced by factors such as low term premiums and weak global growth. The Fed takes the yield curve into consideration but also considers other data and factors when assessing the economic situation.", "'QUESTION': What is your rule for stopping as far as interest rate cuts go and have you felt a need to take any steps to boost employee morale at a time when the President is constantly criticizing the Fed?\n\n'ANSWER': We don't have a specific stopping rule for interest rate cuts, but we will stop when we think we've done enough. We're monitoring the situation and will make decisions based on the evolving economy. As for employee morale, it's very high and we feel unified in serving the American people.", "'QUESTION': Is the Fed investigating Bank of America for opening unauthorized accounts and are you concerned about the size of these banks?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Powell stated that he saw the headline about the CFPB investigating Bank of America, but he doesn't have any information on it. He mentioned the wide breakdowns in risk management at Wells Fargo, which harmed consumers and the institution's image, but he doesn't know if the same happened at Bank of America.", "'QUESTION': Do you consider the limitations of monetary policy and should you be more explicit about what it can and cannot do?\n'ANSWER': Our job is to use our tools to achieve maximum employment and stable prices. Fiscal policy is more powerful and has more influence on long-term growth. The growth rate of the United States is not determined by monetary policy, but by other factors. We provide advice to fiscal authorities at a high level, but they ultimately decide what is appropriate.", "'QUESTION': How do you respond to criticisms from President Trump and do you have any regrets about having press conferences?\n'ANSWER': I won't respond to comments made by elected officials. The independence of the Federal Reserve has served the public well. We will continue to conduct monetary policy without political considerations, using facts, evidence, and objective analysis to pursue our goals.", "'QUESTION': Does the Fed have concerns over the impacts of a global glut for U.S. debt and do they discuss this with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin?\n'ANSWER': Not really, no. The responsibility for determining how much to spend, the size of deficits, and how to finance it lies with the Treasury and Congress. The Fed considers fiscal policy as external to their work, but they do believe it's important for the U.S. fiscal picture to return to a sustainable footing.", "'QUESTION': Is there any risk to the United States having much higher interest rates than Europe and Japan and other parts of the world? Is there any risk to the U.S. economy to that divergence or any risk to the global economy?\n'ANSWER': Global capital markets are highly integrated, and low rates abroad indicate weak global growth and expectations of low inflation. This affects the US economy as it pulls down US rates and tightens financial conditions. The international sector's impact on the US economy is considered when setting interest rate policy."]}
