Chair Powell, did you consider a rate cut today ?  Specifically , was it one of the options \u2014the policy options in the Teal book?  And is the Committee considering moving , given all the uncertainty you addressed , moving  its\u2014changing its policy before the next meeting?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of global and domestic economic and financial co nditions and then spent this morning talking about monetary policy.  And I came to the view that I expressed to you, which is that we \u2019re going to be monitoring \u2014monitoring the crosscurrents and the other items that we \u2019ve mentioned, but that    we\u2019d like to see  more going forward.  Particularly, we \u2019d like to see whether these risks co ntinue to weigh on the outlook.  So, generally, as I mentioned, many on the Committee do see a strengthened case\u2014eight of those , a strengthen ed case for cutting rates.  Eight actuall y wrote down rate cuts .  A number of others see that the case ha s strengthened .  But the Committee wanted to see more, as I mentioned.  And I also mentioned that some of these \u2014some of these developments have been of quite recent vintage .

I expect a full range of data and information on all of these issues that we are looking at.  I think we \u2019ll learn a great deal more about them .  And I think that \u2019s\u2014we think that that \u2019s the right way to move here.  Again, many of these developments happened , you know, part of the way through the last intermeeting period.  Only seven weeks ago, we had a great jobs report and came out of the last FOMC meeting feeling that the economy , and our policy , was in a good place.  So we want to see\u2014we want to see and w e want to react to developments and trends that are sustained, that are genuine , and not react just to data points or just to changes in sentiment , which can be volatile.  At the same time, we are \u2014we \u2019re quite mindful of the risks to the outlook and are pre pared to move and use our tools as needed t o sustain the expansion\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Could you walk us through your thinking about trade?  It was really the threat of tariffs against Mexico that caused at least the market  to become definitively banking , or\u2014pricing in rate cuts .  If, for example, there \u2019s a deal with China, does that take the possibil ity of rate cuts off the table?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Ye ah, so I would say that we \u2019re not looking at any one thing.  I guess I would start by agreeing with your premise that news about trade has been an important driver of sentiment in the intermeeting period.  But we \u2019re also looking at global growth.  It \u2019s really trade developments and concerns about globa l growth that are on our minds.  So we \u2019re not exclusively focused on one event or one piece of data.  Risks seem to have grown.  In the meantime, we have incoming data in the United States that \u2019s been pretty good, particularly for the consumer :  Consumer spending is solid supported by, you know, a healthy job market, high levels of employment, wages going up.  We do see , though, some areas that we\u2019re looking at , such as , I mentioned, business fixed income.2  So\u2014also , the prolonged shortfall in inflation and perhaps job growth\u2014we don\u2019 t like to look at one job report .  We like to average over three or six months, but still that bears watching.  So we \u2019ll be monitoring the implications of all of those developments for the U.S. economic outlook.  We expect to learn a good deal more , as I mentioned.  And we \u2019ll be asking the question whether those risks are going to continue to weigh on the outlook.

So we \u2019re always trying to balance that risk, but I would say that, given the quite recent nature of some of the events, I think the Committee felt , though, that the right thing to do was to wait and see more.  And we will see a lot more on all  of these issues in the very near term.  So I don \u2019t think the risk of waiting too long is prominent right now.  I would say , as a general matter, it \u2019s always something that we h ave to weigh.

In this case, you know, there \u2019s always some judgment in these things.

You had your first dissent in your time as C hairman.  Does that give us a sense that there was debate among a group that  was pushing for a rate cut this time?

And I feel like you make better decisions when you    hear a disparity of views .  So I really do look at it that way.

Mario Draghi at the ECB yesterday sent a strong signal of new stimulus for the euro zone .  Do you think that such actions to ease policy at other central banks around the world will put more pres sure on the Fed to do the same?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, first, I think all central banks are focused on their domestic \u2014their mandates are domestic , and they \u2019re focused on economic conditions from a domesti c standpoint.  And that goes for the European Central Bank, it goes for the Fed, it goes for all central banks .  So that \u2019s our principal focus.  So it could cut either way.  You know, I would think that , to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB  after a rate cut, that would support \u2014tend to support activity.3  So we \u2019re really focused on, you know, the risks to our \u2014on the baseline outlook, which is still a pretty favorable one, and the risks to those outlooks.

And , secondly, on inflation, that was a pretty big drop in expected PCE, yet, you know, without reacting to it, are you not sort of undermining your own credibility in terms of commitment to the 2 percent target?                                                   3 Chair Powell intended to say \u201cstronger activity in the euro area.\u201d   \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I\u2019ll take th e inflation one first.

Or is\u2014was there any concern on the Committee that this would tell consumers, tell people , \u201cDon\u2019t borrow now, don\u2019 t spend now , because rates will get cheaper later \u201d\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I see.  Okay , right.  Okay .  So let me let me answer the inflation question first.  So we \u2019re saying that we know \u2014I noted in the statement and also in my \u2014what I said here.  We saw that market -based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens , dropped.  We noted that also in the statement.  And I noted it as a reason for us to \u2014one of several reasons why it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened.  So we find that notable.  Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this  year, among FOMC participants , dropped a couple of tenths.  So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation.  Let me say , on inflation, it \u2019s something I \u2019ve been concerned about for quite a long time.  It\u2019s one of the principal reasons why I called fo r the review .  In a world where policy rates are going to be closer to the effective lower bound, t hen, just as a general matter, we need to be really strong on 2 percent inflation.  So I think, you know, we certainly don \u2019t want to be seen as weak on infla tion, and I don't believe we are.     In terms of the dots, you\u2019 re right , this is the first time , I believe, we \u2019ve had \u2014we\u2019ve talk ed about cutting in the \u201c dot era. \u201d  I guess the dot era began in January 2012.  And, you know, we \u2019re working our way through it.  A nd I think it \u2019s just something we do.  You know  that my view on the dots is that they , overall , provide useful information for people , but that we need to do our absolute best to explain what they are and what they are not.  Speaking of which, they are not a forecast of the group, they \u2019re not discussed or debated at the meeting, they \u2019re an input to policy more than an output of policy , and they \u2019re also only the most likely case.  So , in a situation where there \u2019s relatively high uncertainty, the re\u2019s the most likely case, but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely.  But that doesn \u2019t show up in the dot.  The dot is either one thing or it \u2019s another.  So I just would say that , if you pay too close attention to the dots, then you may lose sight of the larger picture\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr. Chairman, if and when the Committee decides to cut rates, I suspect there \u2019ll be a debate over whether to move by 25 or 50 basis points.  Indeed , there\u2019 s a pretty substantial body of academic literature arguing that a central bank close to the zero lower bound ought to act sooner and more aggressively than it otherwise would.  I\u2019m w ondering what you think of that prescription, and if you could spe nd a couple of minutes discussing the pros and cons of the 50  basis point cut and how you approach that question\n\nCHAIR POWELL: On the specific question of that , that \u2019s just something we haven \u2019t really engaged with yet , and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk    picture as we move forward.  So it would be \u2014so nothing I can say about that is specific to the near-term question that we face.  More generally , though, the research you refer to essentially notes that , in a world where you are closer to the effective lower bound, i t\u2019s why \u2014research kind of shows this \u2014it\u2019 s wise to react , for example, to prevent a weakening from  turning into a prolonged weakening .  In other words, sort of , an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  So  I think that is a valid way to think about policy in this era.  I don \u2019t know \u2014and it \u2019s always in the \u2014I think it \u2019s in the minds of policymakers, you know, during this era, because it \u2019s well understood to be correct.  Again, I don\u2019t know what that means in t erms of the size of a particular rate cut going forward.  That \u2019s going to depend heavily upon, you know, the actual data  and the evolving risk picture\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Donna Borak with CNN.  Thanks , Chairman Powell.   Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has provided a proposal to revalue the U.S. dollar in order to address concerns about rising trade deficits .  The President himself has routinely complained about the strength of the U.S. dollar , saying i t has resulted in , quote, \u201ctremendous ,\u201d close quote, competitive advantage with countries like China and others.  Do you think that an overvalued dollar has been a drag on America\u2019s global competitiveness?  And would you support an intervent ion of some kind on this issue?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: The U.S. Treasury has responsibility for exchange rate policy , not the Fed, and we don\u2019t comment , in that sense , on the level of the dollar.  We have the responsibility for maximum employment and stable prices, and we use ou r tools to achieve that.     Of course, we do that through changing financial conditions , and one of those is the dollar, but we don\u2019t target the dollar.  It\u2019s just something that we don\u2019t do.  In fact, central banks \u2014or, rather , nations , when they get together , routinely adopt a communique that says we will target our domestic , economic , and financial conditions and not our exchange rate in using monetary policy, and that includes the United States, that includes the G-20 communique that we adopted 10 days ago.  So I\u2019m not the right person to ask about that sort of dollar policy intervention\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Chairman Powell .  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones.  If the most \u2014according to the dot plot, I mean \u2014if the most likely case is that you will have to cut rates in the next 18 months and given some of the concerns about, you know, policy needing to react sooner and more aggressively, what would have been the downsides to cutting rates now?  Why not just cut them now?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, why not now?  And, I would say , there was not much support for cutting rates now at this meeting.  There was, as you see, a number of people wrote down rate cuts.  But all of those , but apparently one , felt that it would be better to see more to \u2014before moving.  And I gave a co uple of reasons why that is the case.  First , it\u2019s just the fact that some of  these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they\u2019ll sustain.  So we felt that it would be better to get a clearer picture of things, and that we would , in fact , learn a lot about these developments in the near term.  Ultimately, the question we\u2019re going to be asking ourselves is, are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook?  And we will act as needed, including promptly , if that\u2019s appropriate , and use our tools to expand\u2014to sustain the expansion\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Yes.  Thank you for doing this, Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  How do you reconcile the conflicting economic data coming in?     You know, on one hand, you have str ong overall growth.  C onsumer spending is strong.  On the other hand, manufacturing numbers were a little bit weaker, you have growth in  jobs but coming in a little weaker, and then you have low inflation.  And then, specifically, what data are you looking  at that you decided not to have a rate cut?  Why didn\u2019t you do that?  [0:24:15.5]\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, you gave a pretty good picture.  I mean, it\u2019s a complicated picture , and , you know , the answer is , we look at all of it.  But I would say , the big pieces of it are this :  The baseline outlook has been a good one, and that has basically been consumer spending coming back up in the second quarter .  That is coming true.  And consumer spending is at a healthy level , and that makes sense.  You\u2019ve  got a tight labor market.  You\u2019ve got companies in surveys saying that labor is scarce.  You\u2019ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are plentiful.  You\u2019ve got wages going up.  You\u2019ve got high levels of  household confidence.  So, all of that , underlyin g fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy , which is 70 percent of the economy , is quite solid.  Job creation, if you take a three -month average , is still well above, you know, the entry \u2014level of entry into the workforce.  So that part of  the economy is solid.  You mentioned manufacturing , and we\u2019re seeing this all around the world.  Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker.  It\u2019s not solely a domestic issue , and it may be that there are a range of factors that are contributing  to that, including, for example, what China has done over the last couple of years in working to bring down its leverage.  Some of it may be uncertainty over your supply chains due to trade developments.  The Boeing 737 issues may be contributing in their  own way .  So the re\u2014lower oil prices are contributing to lower investment , although they\u2019re also leading to lower gas prices , which support s spending.  So there are many, many things.  There isn\u2019t any one thing that explains it all.  But it\u2019s something tha t    we\u2019re watching.  But you do see growth in services, so you\u2014this pattern around the world of weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that\u2019s kind of t he two big pieces of it that you see.  Then you see the crosscurrents .  If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that \u2014concerns about global growth and trade developments \u2014you have the full picture.  And I think what that picture \u2014what we took away from that pic ture is that we\u2019d like to see more, that we do see these risks , and what we want to do is , we want  to watch and see whether they continue to weigh upon the outlook\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and R adio.  If consumer spending is solid and business investment has been slowed by uncertainty, I\u2019d like to get your thinking on what a Fed rate cut would do?  Have you modeled the additional growth and inflation you might get from a rate cut?  Can you identi fy any sectors that would benefit from a lower cost of capital ?  Or is this really about the Fed being the only game in town?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, we have the tools we have , and we\u2019re committed and sworn to use them to support economic activity .  And they do support economic activity through a number of channels that are reasonably well understood\u2014 some more directly tied to interest rates than others.

And so we will use those tools and use them as we see as appropriate to achieve our objective s, which really are to sustain this expansion, and I would just make a note of that.  The reason why we say \u201c sustain the expansion\u201d  is, you\u2019re see ing now , for the first time, you know, communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn\u2019t    been earlier.

And I just would say , that\u2019s why we think \u2014it\u2019s one of the reasons why we think it\u2019s so important to sustain the expansion, keep it going, because we really are benefiting groups that haven\u2019t seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time.

Y ou\u2019ve said that the Fed doesn\u2019t take short -term political considerations into account, and you\u2019ve defended the Fed\u2019 s independence.  So I was wondering, is there a point at which you think that , publicly or privately , you should push back on the President\u2019s  criticisms rather than ignoring him?   And also, do you think that you and the President have the same goals when it comes to monetary policy?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know , I don\u2019t \u2014I don\u2019t discuss elected officials publicly or privately , really .  So I would just say that we are \u2014at the Fed , we\u2019re deeply committed to carrying out our mission, a nd also that our independence from direct political control we see as an important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.

And did anyone from Fa cebook talk with anyone at the Fed before Libra was unveiled this week?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central bank currencies, I think we\u2019re a long way from that.  And, of course , the\u2014so I think we\u2019re a long way from that.  Digital currencies are in their infancy.  So, essentially, not too concerned about, you know, the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies.  You know, Facebook, I believ e, has made quite broad rounds in \u2014around the world really with regulator s, supervisors , and lots of people to discuss their plans , and that certainly includes us.  And we\u2019re \u2014you know, it\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at.  We meet with a broad range of private -sector firms all the time on financial technology , and there\u2019s just a tremendous amount of innovation going on out there.  You know, there are potential benefits here .  There are also potential risks , particularly of a currency that could, you know, that c ould potentially have large application.

Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I want to take you back to Chicago and the review of your monetary policy strategy.  And something interesting, I think, is developing , is that outside experts are excited and  are\u2014like the idea of the Fed shifting your inflation target up to 4 percent \u2014around there , roughly , I guess.  They think that that would, you know, help monetary policy , and that there \u2019s no\u20142 percent is not , like , sanctimonious or anything , or whatever , sacred.  It seems that you \u2019ve taken that off the table.  So I was wondering if you could discuss that .  Have you taken it off the table ?  And then, if so , why , or\u2014and what \u2019s your thoughts on that ?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  We have\u2014we\u2019ve said that we wouldn\u2019 t look at raising the tar get rate for inflation.  We did say that.  And the reason is , it\u2019s become a global norm , 2 percent .  Our statutory mandate is price stability.  And so we \u2019re actually taking a less \u2014we\u2019re looking at less radical ideas , such as how to make the 2 percent infla tion objective more credible.  This gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago, in particular.  So it \u2019s a new thing for us .  It\u2019s something that \u2014I thought it was both appropriate and important for us to do.  It \u2019ll be a yearlong , or even longer , process , looking at our strategy , tools , and communications.  And it \u2019s meant to be a way to open ourselves up, to let the sunshine in, and have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve.  We \u2019ve had a series of Fed Listens  around the country at every Reserve Bank,  and we had an academic conference earlier this month , with seven papers written and criticized , and leading global experts.  But I \u2019ll just say , again , that the heart of the conference was the two panels on \u2014with practitioners in low and moderate income \u2014who live in low - and moderate -income communities and are part of those communities.  And they were \u2014there, I think, people were quite struck by their intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum  employment is    and what it means in their communities.  You know, the idea being , they haven \u2019t had, you know, a bull market in these communities.  They haven \u2019t had , just , a booming economy.  What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems.  And just now , you have, you know, companies who want to hire and are bringing people into the \u2014providing opportunities for people to come into the labor force to an extent not seen in quite a long time. And that is , I think, you know, for someone who does this work, that was very focusing and motivating , too.  So I think everybody thought, you know, that \u2019s\u2014that was really quite worth doing.  I mean, there was some thought at the beginning that we should\u2014s ome people recommended that we just talk to, you know , econ Ph .D.\u2019s about this, but , no, that \u2019s not what we chose to do, and we \u2019re glad this is the choice we made.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: But even those two panels that you just referenced, the people that spoke, they\u2014when they were asked about, you know, 2 percent inflation or higher inflation, they kind of shrugged their shoulders, you know?  So\u2014is 4 percent inflation radical ?  And to who?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I don \u2019t think it\u2019 s\u2014I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s a practical alternative.  And I \u2019ll tell you why.  I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world.  You see central banks having a hard time getting inflation up to their \u2014close to their objective.  We \u2019ve done better than other large central banks that are not, you know, open e conomies , like the U.K., where you have big currency moves that move inflation around.  So\u2014but it \u2019s quite challenging to get inflation \u2014it\u2019s been \u2014even with very high level s of resource utilization, inflation has been lingering and not getting back up to tar get in  a sustained , symmetric kind of a way.  So saying that you\u2019 re going to go for 4 percent \u2014I wonder how credible that will be\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  John Heltman with American Banker.   I have a question about the Fed\u2019s\u2014or, I guess , the b ank r egulators \u2019 leverag ed lending guidance from 2013.  As you know,    the GAO had a letter saying that they thought it was a rule , and it sort of went away.  But yet leveraged lending is a source of concern .  You yourself have said that credit  underwriting quality seems to be deteriorating somewhat lately , and that the Fed has tools to supervise banks and to prevent leverage d lending from becoming too much of an issue.  I want to know what the \u2014is the 2013 guidance still representative of the , sort of , Fed\u2019s thinking about lever aged lending?  And does the Fed have any intent \u2014intention to either issue , like , a leveraged lending rule or a new guidance that is less problematic ?  Or is the plan to just kind of carry on with supervision as you\u2019re\u2014as you  are\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So the 2013 guidance is not binding , and that \u2019s what came out of the GAO review.  But that \u2019s really the beginning of this \u2014of the story.  You know, we have the authority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure.  So, this \u2014the first thing you star t with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves through their portfolio, through the risks that they \u2019re running and the pipeline \u2014you know, the obligations that they \u2019ve undertaken to underwrite deals.  And so we monitor that  very carefully \u2014so do the banks \u2014and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before the crisis.  And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests .  We impose very large losses on those portfolios, so we kind of have a sense of what  that is , whereas before the crisis, there was a lot of lack of knowledge about what the losses would be.  So that \u2019s where it starts for us in supervision, is the risks that the banks are running \u2014you know, running on their own books and to themselves and t o each other.  So, in that, I feel \u2014I feel like that is \u2014that\u2019s in a good place , but we never \u2014we never  say \u201cMission accomplished\u201d  on that.  We will keep\u2014 you know, keep monitoring that carefully.     What \u2019s happened, though, is , the paper  is now owned by market -based vehicles :  collateralized loan obligations, mutual funds , and things like that.  And so we now have \u2014you know, we have a good sense of , domestically , of where that paper is.  I think, internationally , not as much , and the Financial S tability Board is actually looking more carefully at that.  And we \u2014you know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are.  And they \u2019re actually pretty stably funded, in the  sense that there\u2019 s no run risk, but  there\u2019 s still macroeconomic risk.  And, y ou know, this is something that we take very seriously and that the FSOC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council , is looking at.  And, you know, we call it out as a macroeconomic risk, but it \u2019s not really a financial stability risk , in the sense that it could undermine the ability of the financial system to do its job of intermediating credit.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Is there any intention , is there any plan on the part of the Fed or other regulators to sort of create any additional clarity for , or\u2014and  consistenc y, really \u2014that\u2019s the other point of guidance, right ?\u2014is to make sure everyone knows kind of what the supervisory  expectations are for leveraged lending and for all \u2014for anything , for that matter.  Is anything else coming?  Or is it just going to  remain kind of , like , bilateral kind of conversations with banks?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: ou know, I think the issue isn\u2019 t that the banks don\u2019 t understand what the rules are.  The issue is that the risk isn \u2019t in the banks.  It \u2019s in\u2014it\u2019s out in those market -based vehicles.  So  I don\u2019 t, I don\u2019t \u2014you know, I no longer am day -to-day involved in this as I was before I took this job.  But my sense is , though, that that\u2019 s really not the problem.  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s perfect , but I think we do understand what risks the banks are runnin g.  And really the question is, how concerned should we be about large holdings by market -based vehicles that I mentioned, and what risks do they present ?

I \u2019m just wondering if you could expand a little bit on the labor market.  So the statement noted that the labor market still remains strong , but the May jobs report  that that we saw missed on estimates , but employment rates still stayed at 3.6 percent.  I \u2019m wondering how you reconcile that with the fact that we only got 3.1 percent year-over-year wage growth in that report.  What does that tell you about employment, and by all standards compared to, say , a month ago or a year ago, are we closer or farther away from full employment or maximum employment?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know , we have to be closer , because more jobs are being created than people a re entering the labor force.  The unemployment rate is lower.  You know, by just lots and lots of numbers, the labor market is in a good place.  You mentioned wages .  So the level of wages is very consistent with what it should be , in the  sense that it \u2019s approximately equal to inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis.  So what \u2019s, I guess , a little surprising , though, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late \u2014you know, long into a cycle, let\u2019s say , and not see even higher wages  that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this level, even though they \u2019re growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they \u2019re not growing at a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation. So, you know, we watch \u2014we watch  all of this very carefully , and I think we \u2019re very careful about not assuming that we \u2019re, you know, that would\u2014that there \u2019s no more slack in the labor market.  You know, we \u2019ve all lived through \u2014you know, when I got to the Fed, we we re in the 8 percent \u2013plus range , and it \u2019s just gone down and down and down, and you haven\u2019 t seen wages picked up.  You haven\u2019 t seen real signals that we\u2019re at maximum employment.  You have    seen a tightening labor market.

Due to increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor incoming information and take appropriate action to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its objective.The latest data from China and Europe were positive, but trade negotiations with China and global growth indicators have raised concerns. Uncertainty in trade developments and deteriorating risk sentiment have led to a drop in business confidence and inflation remains low. As a result, the question of whether additional monetary policy accommodation is needed has arisen, with many FOMC participants seeing a stronger case for a more accommodative policy.The outlook for jobs and growth is positive, with unemployment expected to remain low this year and next. Although May's job gains were lower than expected, many labor market indicators remain strong. Additionally, wages are rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs. The growth projections for 2019 are little revised from March, with a central tendency of 2 percent to 2.2 percent, but the composition of growth is important to consider. The surprisingly strong first quarter will boost annual growth, but it was largely driven by net exports and inventories, which are not reliable indicators of ongoing momentum.The economy is primarily driven by consumption and business investment, with consumption showing a strong rebound but business fixed income and manufacturing production experiencing slowdowns. The risk of less favorable outcomes has increased due to weaker business sentiment and investment, while inflation is expected to gradually move back towards the 2 percent objective at a slower pace than anticipated. Wages are rising, but not enough to significantly impact inflation.Weaker global growth may continue to keep inflation low worldwide, which could lead to a downward drift in longer-run inflation expectations. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have decreased, and concerns were expressed about a sustained shortfall of inflation. As a result, many participants believe that a cut in the federal funds rate would be appropriate to support economic activity and bring inflation back to the 2 percent objective.The uncertainties surrounding the outlook have increased since the last meeting, but it is crucial that monetary policy does not overreact to individual data or short-term changes in sentiment as it could further add to the uncertainty. Therefore, the committee will assess whether these uncertainties will continue to impact the outlook and utilize appropriate tools to sustain the expansion. Thank you, and I am available for any questions.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Did the Committee consider a rate cut today and is the Committee considering changing its policy before the next meeting?\n'ANSWER': The Committee had discussions on global and domestic economic conditions and monetary policy. While some members see a strengthened case for rate cuts, the Committee wants to see more and monitor the risks and developments before making any decisions. They expect to learn more in the near term.", "'QUESTION': Do you think something could change before the next meeting?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell expects changes before the next meeting, with a full range of data and information to be considered. The focus is on sustained and genuine developments and trends, rather than reacting to individual data points or changes in sentiment. The committee remains mindful of risks and is prepared to use tools as needed to sustain economic expansion.", "'QUESTION': Could a trade deal with China eliminate the possibility of rate cuts?\n'ANSWER': We are not solely focused on trade developments, but also on global growth. While news about trade has influenced sentiment, we are also considering other factors such as consumer spending, business fixed investment, inflation, and job growth. We will continue to monitor these developments and use our tools as needed to sustain economic expansion.", "'QUESTION': What would the Fed Chair do if the President wants to demote them?\n'ANSWER': The Fed Chair states that they have a four-year term and they intend to serve it, indicating that they would not comply with the President's request.", "'QUESTION': How does the Federal Reserve balance the risks of waiting too long to cut rates versus cutting rates prematurely?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve is always trying to balance these risks, but currently, they believe it is best to wait and see how the risks unfold in the near term. They do not see the risk of waiting too long as prominent right now and will continue to monitor the situation closely.", "'QUESTION': [Inaudible]\n'ANSWER': The risks that have emerged have caught our attention and led some of us to write down rate cuts, while others see that the case for rate cuts has strengthened. We try to avoid premature actions and exercise judgment in these matters.", "'QUESTION': Does the first dissent in your time as Chairman indicate debate among those pushing for a rate cut, and can we expect more dissents in the future?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman believes that dissent is a healthy part of the decision-making process and leads to better decisions. While there was a dissent this time, the support for the policy statement adopted was broad.", "'QUESTION': Do you think that actions to ease policy at other central banks will put more pressure on the Fed to do the same?\n'ANSWER': Central banks are primarily focused on their domestic mandates and economic conditions. The impact of stimulus actions by other central banks could go either way, depending on the resulting financial conditions and activity. The Fed's principal focus is on the risks to the baseline outlook and the risks to those outlooks.", "'QUESTION': Is there concern that telling people rates will be cut could cause a \"dot deflation\" and undermine credibility in meeting the 2 percent inflation target?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell didn't understand the \"dot\" question, but regarding inflation, he didn't address the drop in expected PCE and its impact on credibility.", "'QUESTION': The reporter asks why the Federal Reserve is not responding to the decrease in expected inflation from 1.8 to 1.5.\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell acknowledges the question and refers to it as the \"inflation question.\"", "'QUESTION': Are you saying that you are not considering raising interest rates?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell confirms that he is not considering raising interest rates.", "'QUESTION': Was there concern that signaling rate cuts would discourage borrowing and spending?\n'ANSWER': We acknowledged that market-based measures of inflation expectations dropped and the forecast for inflation this year decreased. We are committed to maintaining strong inflation and the dots, while providing useful information, are not a forecast and should not be overemphasized.", "'QUESTION': What are the pros and cons of a 50 basis point rate cut and how does the Federal Reserve approach this question?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve has not yet engaged with the question of whether to cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points. The decision will depend on incoming data and the evolving risk picture. Research suggests that in a world close to the effective lower bound, it is wise to react to prevent a prolonged weakening. However, the specific size of a rate cut will depend on actual data and the evolving risk picture.", "'QUESTION': Do you think that an overvalued dollar has been a drag on America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global competitiveness? And would you support an intervention of some kind on this issue?\n'ANSWER': The Fed does not comment on the level of the dollar as exchange rate policy is the responsibility of the U.S. Treasury. The Fed focuses on maximum employment and stable prices, and while the dollar is a factor, it is not targeted. Monetary policy is used to target domestic economic and financial conditions, not exchange rates.", "'QUESTION': What were the downsides to cutting rates now?\n'ANSWER': There was not much support for cutting rates now at this meeting. Most participants felt it would be better to wait and see if recent developments would sustain. The question is whether these risks will continue to weigh on the outlook, and the Fed will act promptly if needed.", "'QUESTION': How do you reconcile the conflicting economic data coming in, such as strong overall growth and consumer spending, but weaker manufacturing numbers, weaker job growth, and low inflation? What data influenced the decision not to have a rate cut?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve considers all the economic data, but the key factors are strong consumer spending, tight labor market, high household confidence, and solid job creation. Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker globally, possibly due to various factors like China's efforts to reduce leverage and trade uncertainties. The Fed wants to monitor these risks before making any rate cut decisions.", "QUESTION: Do you think Fed policy can solve the problems caused by the crosscurrents?\n\nANSWER: We believe that our interest rate policy can support demand and business investment, and we will use our tools as appropriate to sustain the expansion and benefit groups that haven't seen prosperity in a long time.", "'QUESTION': Do you think Fed policy can solve the problems caused by the crosscurrents?\n'ANSWER': We take the crosscurrents as a given and react to anything that could undermine our dual-mandate goals.

Did anyone from Facebook talk with anyone at the Fed before Libra was unveiled?\n\n'ANSWER': Digital currencies are still in their infancy, so the replacement of central bank currencies is a long way off. Facebook has engaged with regulators and supervisors worldwide, including the Fed. While there are potential benefits, there are also potential risks, and if Facebook decides to proceed with Libra, high expectations for safety, soundness, and regulation will be required.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the Fed will be involved in regulating Libra then?\n'ANSWER': The Fed does not have complete authority over cryptocurrencies, but they do have influence through consumer protection and money laundering regulations. They also have significant input into the payment system through international forums and play an important role in the US payment system.", "'QUESTION': Have you taken the idea of shifting the inflation target up to 4 percent off the table?\n'ANSWER': We have decided not to raise the target rate for inflation because 2 percent has become a global norm. Instead, we are exploring less radical ideas to make the 2 percent inflation objective more credible. The review process is meant to open dialogue and criticism with the constituencies we serve, including low and moderate-income communities.", "'QUESTION': Is 4 percent inflation radical and to who?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell believes that 4 percent inflation is not a practical alternative. Disinflationary pressures exist globally, and central banks struggle to reach their inflation targets. Despite high resource utilization, inflation remains below target. Chair Powell questions the credibility of aiming for 4 percent inflation.", "'QUESTION': Is the 2013 leveraged lending guidance still representative of the Fed's thinking? Will there be a new rule or guidance?\n'ANSWER': The 2013 guidance is not binding, but the Fed has the authority to examine banks for safety and soundness. They closely monitor the risks banks are taking and have seen smaller exposures than before the crisis. The paper is now owned by market-based vehicles, and while they are stably funded, there is still macroeconomic risk. The Financial Stability Board is looking into this. It is considered a macroeconomic risk, not a financial stability risk.", "'QUESTION': Is there any intention or plan to create additional clarity and consistency in supervisory expectations for leveraged lending and other areas?\n'ANSWER': The issue is not that banks don't understand the rules, but that the risk lies in market-based vehicles. The concern is about large holdings by these vehicles and the risks they present. The Fed is carefully assessing this and taking all risks seriously.", "QUESTION: How do you reconcile the strong labor market with the low wage growth and are we closer or farther away from full employment compared to before?\n\nANSWER: The labor market is in a good place with more jobs being created than people entering the workforce. The level of wages is consistent with inflation and productivity increases. However, it is surprising that wages at this level are not pushing up on inflation. We are careful not to assume there is no more slack in the labor market, despite the tightening labor market.", "QUESTION: Did the FOMC discuss a change to its balance sheet policy at this meeting, perhaps ending runoffs earlier than planned? And would the Committee be inclined to do something like that if it lowers rates before September?\nANSWER: Balance sheet runoff is close to its planned end, but no decisions have been made. If more accommodation is provided, the Committee will consider adjusting the balance sheet policy to serve its dual-mandate objectives."]}
