few key points regarding each of these two policy  tools ", "neutral"], ["  First, today the Committee reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6\u00bd percent so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the senses described in the FOMC statement ", "dovish"], [" As I have noted frequently, the phrase \u201c at least as long\u201d in the Committee \u2019s interest rate guidance is important", "dovish"], [" T he economic conditions we have set out as preceding any future rate i ncrease are thresholds, not triggers ", "neutral"], [" For example, assuming that inflation is near our objective at that time, as expected, a decline in the unemployment rate to 6\u00bd percent would not lead automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but rather would indicate only that it was appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase ", "neutral"], [" All else equal, the more subdued the outlook for inflation at that time, the more patient the Committee would  likely be in making that assessment ", "dovish"], [" In the projections submitted for this meeting, 14 of 19 FOMC participants indicated that they expect the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate to occur in 2015, and one June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  4 of 28   expected the first increase to  incur in 2016", "hawkish"], [" Moreover, so long as the economy remains short of maximum employment, inflation remains near our longer -run objective, and inflation expectations remain well  anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they begin, ar e likely to be gradual, consistent with the Committee \u2019s balanced approach to meeting its employment and price stability objectives ", "neutral"], ["  The purpose of this forward guidance about policy is to assure households and businesses that monetary policy will continu e to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job creation picks up", "dovish"], [" Importantly, as our statement notes, the Committee expects a considerable interval of time to pass between when the Committee will cease adding accommodation through asset purchases and the time when the Committee will begin to reduce accommodation by moving the federal funds rate target toward more normal levels ", "dovish"], ["  The second policy tool being employed by the Committee is asset purchases ", "dovish"], [" Specifically, the Committee has been purchasing $40 billion per month in agency mortgage -backed securities and $45 billion per month in Treasury securities ", "dovish"], [" When our program of asset purchases was initiated last September, the Committee stated the goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the  context of price stability and noted it would also be taking appropriate account of the efficacy and costs of the program ", "neutral"], [" Today the Committee made no changes to the purchase program ", "neutral"], ["  Although the Comm ittee left the pace of purchases unchanged at today \u2019s meeting, it has stated that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve ", "neutral"], [" Any such change would reflect the incoming data and their implications for the outlook, as well as the cumul ative progress made toward the Committee \u2019s objectives since the program began in September ", "neutral"], [" Going forward, the economic outcomes that the Committee sees as most likely involve continuing gains June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  5 of 28   in labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the near -term restraint from fiscal policy and other headwinds diminishes ", "neutral"], [" We also see inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time ", "neutral"], [" If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this forecast, the Co mmittee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year ", "hawkish"], [" And if the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around midyear ", "hawkish"], [" In this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains, a substantial improvement from the 8.1 percent unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee announced this program ", "dovish"], ["  I would like to emphasize once more the point that our policy is in no way predetermined and will  depend on the incoming data and the evolution of the outlook as well as on the cumulative progress toward our objectives ", "neutral"], [" If conditions improve faster than expected, the pace of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly ", "hawkish"], [" If the outlook becomes less favorable, on the other hand, or if financial conditions are judged to be inconsistent with further progress in the labor markets, reductions in the pace of purchases could be delayed", "neutral"], [" Indeed, should it be needed, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase in the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability ", "dovish"], ["  It\u2019s also worth noting here that, even if a modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases occurs, we would not be shrinking the Federal Reserve \u2019s portfolio of securities , but only slowing the pace at which we are adding to the portfolio while continuing to reinvest principal payments June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  6 of 28   and proceeds from maturing holdings as well ", "neutral"], [" These large and  growing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates ", "dovish"], [" To use the analogy of driving an automobile, any slowing in the pace of purchases will be akin to letting up a bit on the gas pedal as the car picks up speed, not to beginning to apply the brakes ", "dovish"], ["  I will close by drawing again the important distinction between the Committee \u2019s decisions about adjusting the pace of asset purchases and its forward guidance regarding the target for the federal funds rate", "neutral"], [" As I mentioned, the current level of the federal funds rate target is likely to remain appropriate for a considerable period after asset purchases are concluded ", "dovish"], [" To return to the driving analogy, if the incoming data support the view that the economy is able to sustain a reasonable cruising speed, we will ease the pressure on the accelerator by gradually reducing the pace of purchases ", "neutral"], [" However, any need to consider applying the brakes by raising short -term rates is still far in the future ", "dovish"], [" In any case, no matter how conditions may evolve, the Federal Reserve remains committed to

I hate to use my question to ask you to clarify something, but when you said gradually reduce purchases, beginning later this year and ending it next year when the unemployment rate hits  7 percent \u2014what is that?  Is that a decision by the FOMC?  Is that an  intention that \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  That is \u2014we had a good discussion of that issue today , and we haven \u2019t had \u2014obviously , there\u2019 s no change, there\u2019 s no change in policy involved here, there \u2019s simply a clarification, helping people to think about where polic y will evolve .

Future policy June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  7 of 28   statements may include elements of this , but it \u2019s not a policy change .  I\u2019m just trying to explain how are \u2014how we \u2019re making a  substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market , how we\u2019re making that concrete , and how we \u2019re thinking about the potential future of the program given alternative policy and economic developments\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  So there is no consensus on t hat?

Is that when \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, there  are many factors that we look at when t rying to judge the state of the labor market .  As you know, we look at participation, payrolls, a variety of other data , but the 7 percent unemployment rate is indicative of the kind of progress we \u2019d like to make in order to be able to say  that we \u2019ve reach ed substantial progress.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr . Chairman, there\u2019 s an undercurrent of optimism in your forecast and your statement \u2014in the policy statement today .  For instance, the unemployment rate forecast comes down to 6.5 to 6.8 percent next year .  It\u2019s the case that the Fed has overestimated the economy \u2019s growth rate very often in the past during this recovery, so \u2014and we \u2019ve gone through a period in the first half of the year with pretty subdued growth.  So I would like to hear you explain where this optimism comes from and how confident you are that these expectations are going to be met. June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  8 of 28 \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, the fundamentals look a little better to us .  In particular, the housing sector, which has been a drag on growth since the crisis , is now, obviously, a support to growth.  It\u2019s not only creating construction jobs, but as house prices rise, increased household wealth supports consumption spending, consumer sentiment .  State and local governments , who have been a major drag , are now coming to a position where they no longer have to lay off large numbers of workers .  Generally speaking, financial conditions are improving .  The main drag , or the main headwind , to growth this year is , as you know, is the federal fiscal policy, which the CBO estimates is something on the order of 1 \u00bd percentage points of growth.  And our judgment is that, you know, given that very heavy headwind, the fact that the economy is still moving ahead at at least a  moderate pace, is indicative that the underlying factors are improving .  And so we \u2019ll see how that evolves .  Obviously, we haven\u2019 t seen the full effect yet of the fiscal policy changes ; we\u2019ll  want to see how that evolves as we get through that fiscal impact .  But we \u2019re hopeful, as you can see from the individual projections \u2014and again, these are individual projections, not an official forecast of the C ommittee \u2014we \u2019ll be obviously very interested to see if the economy does pick up a bit and continue to reduce unemployment, as we anticipate.  I think one thing that \u2019s very important for me to say is that, if you draw the conclusion that I \u2019ve just said , that our policies \u2014that our purchases will end in the middle of next year, you \u2019ve drawn the wrong conclus ion because our purchases are tied to what happens in the economy .  And if the Federal Reserve makes the same error and we overestimate what \u2019s happening, then our policies will adjust to that .  We are not \u2014we have no deterministic or fixed plan.  Rather, our policies are going to depend on this scenario coming true .  If it doesn\u2019 t come true, we \u2019ll adjust our policies to that.  June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  9 of 28 \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Alister Bull from Reuters .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Financial conditions have tightened in the last few weeks and bond yields have gone up, and they \u2019ve gone up again today .  Why do you think that is?  And could you talk a little bit about whether that rise in bond yields and interest \u2014longer -term interest rates could affect your economic outlook and, particularly , given that  mortgage rates are  now back up above  4 percent , if that could affect the recovery under  way in the  housing market?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, that \u2019s a good question.  Yes, rates have come up some .  That \u2019s in part due to more optimism , I think , about the economy .  It\u2019s  in part due to perceptions of the Federal Reserve.  The forecast \u2014the projections that our participants submitted for this meeting , of course , were done in the last few days , so they were done with full knowledge of what had happened to financial conditions .  Rates have tightened some, but, you know, other factors ha ve been more positive \u2014increasing house prices , for example .  I think as far as the housing market is concerned, we \u2019re going to want to watch that , but one important difference now is that people are more optimistic about housing .  They expect house prices to continue to rise , and we see that , for example, in a survey question in the Michigan survey .  And that, you know, compensates to some extent for a slightly higher mortgage rate .  And , in fact, in terms of monthly payments on an average house, the change in mortgage rates we \u2019ve seen so far is not all that dramatic .  So, yes, our forecast \u2014our projections do factor that in, and if interest rates go up for the right rea sons\u2014that is , both optimism about the economy and an accurate assessment of monetary policy \u2014that \u2019s a good thing .  That \u2019s not a bad thing.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, you \u2019ve always argued that it \u2019s the stock of ass ets that the Federal Reserve holds which affects long -term interest rates .  How do you reconcile that with a very sharp rise in real interest rates that we\u2019 ve June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  10 of 28   seen in recent weeks?  And do you think the market is correctly interpreting what you think is most likely to be the future path of the  Federal Reserve\u2019 s stock of assets?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, we were a little puzzled by that.  It was bigger than can be explained I think by changes in the ultimate stock of asset purchases within reasonable ranges .  So I think we have to conclude that there are other factors at work as well , including , again, some optimism about the economy, maybe some uncertainty arising .  So, I \u2019m agreeing with you that it seems larger than can be explained by a changing view of monetary policy .   It\u2019s difficult to judge whether the markets are in sync or not .  Generally speaking though, I think that what I \u2019ve seen from analyst s and market participants is not wildly different from what, you know, the C ommittee is thinking and trying to\u2014as I try today  to communicate .  I think the most important thing that I just want to convey , again , is that it\u2019 s important not to say \u201c this date, that date, this time, \u201d it\u2019s important to understand that our policies are economic dependent and, in particular , if financial conditions move in a way that make this economic scenario unlikely , for example, then that would be a reason for us to adjust our policy . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks .

Craig Torres from Bloomberg .  I\u2019d like to push for a little deeper explanation on thresholds and triggers.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Sure.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  The forecast and the mysterious dots kind of don\u2019 t map into the unemployment forecast .  We see more -gradual rate rise going out into  time .  People moving to the right, at least one person, on when  they expect the rate to increase, and yet, unemployment \u2019s going to fall to  6.5 percent in 2014.  I also note that labor force participation isn \u2019t in that great shape, and you, in fact , have been a big believer that a lot of the exit from the workforce is related to weak demand, not structural factors .  So here is my question.  Can you explain a little bit more \u2014you know \u2014mayb e is the threshold too high?  And I \u2019ll point out that the V ice C hair and two other people who used to work here have done significant research on, maybe you need to let the employment rate fall much lower to pull these people back into the labor force .  So I\u2019m wondering  if you can expand on that \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, it\u2019 s a great question and \u2014but the \u2014what you pointed out, the difference between the little dots and the forecast actually illustrates the point, which is , remember, the 6\u00bd percent is a threshold, not a trigger .  In other words, when we get to that point, we will then at that point begin to, you know, look at whether an increase in rates is appropriate , and among the things we would take into account , first of all , is inflation, and infla tion obviously is very low and expected to stay low .  Secondly, we would be taking into account , does that unemployment rate fairly represent in some sense the state of the labor market ?  And, as you pointed out, we have underemployment , part -time work, pe ople leaving the labor force, reduced participation, long- term unemployment, a number of factors which suggest that maybe th e 6.5 percent is a little bit\u2014not exactly representative of the state of the labor market at that point .  June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  12 of 28   So, first of all, since it is a threshold and not a trigger, we \u2019re entirely free to take all that into account before we begin the process of raising rates , and that \u2019s what the diagram suggests .  People are saying that unemployment will be at 6.5 in late 2014 or  early 2015, but the y\u2019re saying that increases  in rates may not follow but several quarters after that .  In terms of adjusting the threshold, I think that \u2019s something that might happen .  If it did happen, it would be to lower it, I\u2019m sure , not to raise it.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Bin ya Appelbaum, New York Times .  Following up on that, so I understand the 6.5 percent is a threshold, but you\u2019 ve just talked about a 7 percent line for asset purchases .  That sounded less like a threshold than  like a target .  You said if you \u2019re at about that level , you\u2019ll stop with the asset purchases mid  next year .  You talked about wanting to see substantial improvement in the labor market before you did suspend those purchases .  It\u2019s very easy to imagine a  situation in which we get to 7 percent w ithout seeing labor force participation increase.  The employment rate \u2019s been at the same level for three years now .  Has something changed in your thinking about the value of asset purchases?  W hy are you  cutting them off before you see that \u201c substantial improvement \u201d\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, \u201c substantial \u201d is in the eye of the beholder .  I think going from 8.1 percent and a stagnant rate of improvement to 7 percent and stronger economic growth is a substantial increase.  I think it \u2019s important to explain that, you know, we view ourselves as  having two tools .  One of them is rate policy , and that includes both setting the rate and providing guidance about future rates .  That \u2019s our basic tool, that \u2019s the one that the Federal Reserve and other central banks h ave used forever .  Asset purchases are a different kind of thing .  They \u2019re unconventional policy, they come with certain risks and certain uncertainties that are not necessarily associated with rate policy .  So our intent from the beginning , as I\u2019ve been very clear , June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  13 of 28   was to use asset purchases as a way of achieving some near -term momentum to get the economy moving forward into a sustainable recovery .  And then, essentially , to allow the low interest rate policy which\u2014to carry us through.  So what I \u2014so let me  just make two, I think, very important points .  The first is, our target is not 7, it \u2019s not 6\u00bd, our target is maximum employment, which , according to our projections , most people on the C ommittee think is somewhere between 5 and 6 percent unemployment , and that \u2019s where we\u2019 re trying to get to .  The 7, the 6\u00bd\u2014these are guide posts  that tell you how we \u2019re going to be shifting the mix of our tools as we try to land th is ship on a, you know, on a \u2014in a smooth way onto the aircraft carrier .  The \u2014sorry.  So, the other thing I wanted to say was that stopping asset purchases, when that happens , and I think we \u2019re still some distance from that happening , but when that happens, that won\u2019 t involve ending the stimulus from asset purchases because we\u2019 re going to hold on t o that portfolio.  And if the  stock theory of the portfolio is correct , which we believe it is, holding all of  those securities off of the market and reinvesting and still keeping the , you know, rolling -over maturing securities, w ill still continue to put downward  pressure on interest rates .  And so, between our commitments to a low federal funds rate and  the large portfolio, we will still be producing a very large amount of stimulus \u2014in our view , enough to bring the economy smoothly towards full employment without incurring unnecessary costs or risks.

VICTORIA McGRANE .  Hi, Chairman.  Victoria McGrane with Dow Jones Newswires .  You, in your statement be fore the press conference and in the policy statement, acknowledge that inflation readings have been low .  But you maintain that inflation expect\u2014longer -term inflation expectations have remained stable.  But actually, certain bond market measures of these things have fallen in recent weeks .  Is that of any concern , and if not, why?  What would you need to June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  14 of 28   see for the C ommittee to start being more concerned that longer -term inflation expectations are , in fact, falling?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, this is something we watch very carefully .  There are a number of, as I mentioned in th e statement, there are a num ber of transitory factors that may be contributing to the very low inflation rate .  For example, the effects of the sequester on medical payments, the fact that nonmarket prices are extraordinarily low right now .  So these are some things that we expect to  reverse and we expect to see inflation come up a bit .  But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation -adjusted \u2014inflation -index ed bonds have come down.  To this point, they still remain within the historical range that we\u2019ve seen over the past few years .  And moreover, other measures of inflation expectations , be it forecast s by professional forecasters, whether it \u2019s survey measures from firms or households, those are all still pretty much in the same places they we re.   Now that being said, and as I said in my opening remarks, we don \u2019t take anything for granted .  And one of the preconditions for the policy path that I described is that inflation begin , at least gradually , to return towards our 2 percent objective .  If that doesn \u2019t happen, we will obviously have to take some measures to address that .  And we are certainly determined to keep inflation not only \u2014we want to keep inflation near its objective , not only avoiding inflation that \u2019s too high, but we also want to avoid inflation that \u2019s too low\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television.  Given the volatility we \u2019ve seen in the market since your comments of May 22nd, the lengths to which you are stressing the forward guidance here today, it doe s suggest that there are some out there you\u2019re worried are not getting your message right now .  And I \u2019m wondering, to what extent do June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  15 of 28   you think now that your exit strategy is going to be that much more challengin g because even in this small period of time w hen you haven \u2019t done all that much, you\u2019 ve seen this kind of reaction?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, it is important for us to communicate .  It\u2019s particularly important when we have an unusual economic situation where I think the standard relationships are not  applying in the way they have , where we \u2019re using unconventional tools, where we\u2019 re using forward guidance .  So, I guess I agree with you that our communication is going to be very important .  We hope that the \u2014again, the key point I \u2019ve tried to make today is that our policies are tied to how the outlook evolves .  And that should provide some comfort to markets because they will understand, I hope, that we will be providing whatever support is necessary .  If the economy does not improve along the lines that we expect, we\u2019 ll provide additional support .  If financial conditions evolve in a way that \u2019s inconsistent with economic recovery, we will provide support .  But we \u2019re hope \u2014and in that way, we hope to increase confidence both among market participants , but also among investors and private consumers and other people in the economy .  So, but again, I mean, your point is well  taken that we are in a position where the simple adjustment by 25 bas is points to the federal funds rate seems like a long-ago exper ience, and we are in a more complex type of situation .  But we are determined to be as clear as we can , and we hope that you and your listeners and the markets will all be able to follow what we \u2019re saying.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Donna Borak with American Banker .  Next month will be the three -year anniversary of the Dodd\u2013Frank Act , and , as you know, there are a number of significant rulemakings that have left to be finalized :  the Volcker r ule, prudential  regulations under s ection 165 and 166, and risk retention, to name a few .  Can you provide us with an update on where we June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  16 of 28   stand with the rulemakings?  And also, are you still optimistic that we will see these rules completed by the end of this year?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  It\u2019s certainly true that it\u2019 s taken time to do these regulations .  There are a number of reasons for that .  The first is that the y are, inherently , many of them, quite complicated .  The Volcker r ule, for example, involves some very subtle distinctions between hedging and market ma king and proprietary trading .  The second reason is that many of them involve multiple agencies , which have to coordinate, cooperate , and agree on language .  I think the QRM rule is , six agencies are  involved in making that rule .  And the third fact\u2014the th ird and basic issue is that we really have to do our homework.  We have to get these right , and that means having extended comment periods, getting lots of information from the public .  And then, you know, reviewing those comments and doing all we can to m ake sure we\u2019re responsive to those many, many concerns and suggestions .  So it does take time .  I think it\u2019s a little unfair to say, \u201cWell, only 30 percent of the rules have been completed,\u201d  because most of the rules , even if they haven \u2019t been completed , are now very far advanced , and that \u2019s true for the major rules .  We are very close, for example, to completing Basel III .  We have made a good bit of progress on the Volcker r ule, and I do anticipate that being done this year .  We are making additional pr ogress on our 165, 166 advisory rules on the capital surcharges .  These are all things that will be coming relatively soon, at least during, you know, the current year .  And of course, once they are out there, then it will still take some time to be implemented , for financial institutions to change their practices , and so on\u2014and so on.  I would also emphasize , though, that, even as this is going on, that we are not ignoring the health and safety of the banking system .  For example, I mean, since 2009, we \u2019ve been doing these very rigorous stress test s, which are part of the Dodd \u2013Frank rules .  And the amount of capital that U .S. banks hold has June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  17 of 28   roughly doubled\u2014the largest banks \u2014since 2009.  And indeed, the largest banks now appear , most of them , either to be Basel III \u2013compliant or pretty close to Basel III \u2013compliant .  So we are working with the banks to ensure their safety, to help them move in the directions that they know they\u2019re going to have to be going even as the rules themselves are being finalized .  So, it\u2019 s an ongoing process , but I expect to see, you know, more -rapid completion, you know, going forward in the next few quarters.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Peter Barnes, Fox Business .

Could you comment on that?  And could you offer us \u2014give us a little more explanation as to why you \u2019re not going to be in Jackson Hole for the first time?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, as I \u2019ve said, I \u2019m not going to comment on my personal plans , but I will say this .  I think t here\u2019 s a perception that the Jackson Hole conference is a F ederal R eserve S ystemwide conference.  It\u2019s not .  It\u2019s a conference sponsored by one of the 12 R eserve Banks.  Every one of the 12 R eserve Banks has conferences, has meetings, and this is the one I \u2019ve gone to the most of probably any of the R eserve Banks, so I think it \u2019s not inappropriate to go to different conferences, different meetings , and to essentially meet all the constituents that I have in these different R eserve Banks.

A number of your colleagues , as reflected in the new SEP  projections , expect the unemployment rate to get down to 6\u00bd percent next year , which is your threshold for considering raising the f unds rate .  And yet the FOMC has also said that it expects to keep rates very accommodative for a considerable time June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  18 of 28   after asset purchases and after the recovery has strengthened .  And yet here we are, the middle of 2013, you\u2019 ve not even begun to scale back asset purchases .  So, I mean, you\u2019ve  partially address ed this.  But, you know, could there be a conflict between, on the one hand, the asset purchase program, on the other hand, the funds rate guidance policy .  Could they conflict?  Could you perhaps elaborate?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, I certainly hope the unemployment rate comes down so fast  that this becomes a problem .  I guess I would point out a couple of things .  One is that , of course, you know, there \u2019s a range of estimates , and they \u2019re all based on each individual \u2019s idea of optimal policy , so the policy assumptions may not be the same .  So it \u2019s true that some are as low as 6.5, but as I said in my earlier answer, that \u2019s a threshold, not a trigger .  So, evidently , if you, you know, look at the policy expectations that are given in the dot diagram, you\u2019 ll see that the very strong majority of FOMC participants still expect rates to be quite low at the end of 2015.  So that \u2019s not inconsistent, that \u2019s just saying that people are looking at a variety o f factors , including inflation , which is predicted to be quite low, and other perhaps labor market factors in  thinking about when it \u2019ll be appropriate to start increasing rates.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Sir .  Scott Spoerry from CNN, CNNMoney .  Well, first of all, I should tell you that your analogy to landing the economy on an aircraft carrier worried me a little bit because , from personal experience, I find that it \u2019s always a little bit jarring to land on an aircraft carrier .  But I wanted to talk ab out mortgage -backed securities .  You mentioned during your comments here that , if I understood correctly, that you\u2019 re not going to dispose of the mortgage -backed securities that you have on the book during this period of normalization.  A nd I\u2019ve heard many  people on Wall Street and elsewhere say that right now the Federal Reserve is  the market for mortgage -backed securities , and so \u2014which means that it\u2019 s kind of a warped June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  19 of 28   market right now .  And I\u2019m just wondering , how focused are you on mortgage -backed securi ties and this larger world market , which \u2014what used to  be a world market for mortgage -backed securities .  And I guess \u2014I guess what I \u2019m saying, has the ground shifted from under us in terms of the mortgage -backed security world on a permanent basis , or at le ast for a very long -term basis , because of the devastating nature of what happened a few years ago\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, we are still only a fraction of the total holdings of mortgage -backed securities , but, more relevant , as part of our assessment \u2014of our ongoing assessment of the potential cost s of our various  asset purchase programs , we pay very close attention to market functioning .  And our assessment is that the MBS market is still quite a healthy market in terms of the spreads, in terms of execut ion times, in terms of the number of people on both sides of the market .  You know, there are REITs  now that are building up their MBS portfolios .  The re are plenty of real -money investors holding MBS .  So, you know, if the market was really breaking down in some way that would be a fact or we\u2019d have to take into account .  But our assessment \u2014and , of course , we\u2019re in that market quite a bit, s o we have a lot of information about it \u2014our assessment is that that market is still working quite well, and that our purchases are not disrupting the normal price discovery and liquidity functions of that market .  I think that the events of five years ago, obviously , do have a big long -term effect .  There are bills in Congress that would change , reform the GSEs , for example, and ultimately would change the market for mortgage -backed securities, perhaps increasing the amount of private placements or changing the whole institutional structure of that market.  So, we may end up holding some securities , which are in some sense left over from a previous era at some point .  But nevertheless, you know, for the time being, they are the mortgage -backed securit ies market \u2014 Fannie and Freddie are basically it \u2014and we are, of course , legally allowed to buy and June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  20 of 28   own those securit ies.  And so, we have found it useful to do that , and we believe it \u2019s contributed to lower mortgage rates and a stronger housing market .  So that \u2019s been our rationale .  And just , again, to come back to your question, we do not see any significant deteriora tion in market functioning .  If there are things that you can point us to, we would be  obviously  very interested.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Well, let me just follow up with just one thing .  In terms of the government backing through the GSEs of mortgage -backed secur ities, is there a concern, a legitimate concern that without government backing of this market in some way , that because the private market is \u2014seems to move with much more rapidity than government backing and government purchases, that moving the government out of this backup role on mortgage -backed securities would be a real problem or really change the nature of getting a mortgage in America.  Some people say, you know, if the government wasn\u2019 t behind it, it would mean the end of the 30-year mort gage as we know it\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, these issues are being debated .  There are some\u2014 a number of bills in Congress which would change the GSEs, would eliminate them in some cases , or would place them with backstop government support, as  opposed to 100 percent government credit guarantees .  So these are debates that we\u2019 re all having about the future  of the U .S. mortgage market .  I think it \u2019s entirely possible that if there \u2019s major change in the government \u2019s role in the mortgage market that we might see a different structure in mortgages .  And, you know, other countries have different structures , and they have , in many cases , the same or similar home ownership rates as we do, s o it\u2019s possible that we may find that a different structure is better for s ome people . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com .  I was wondering if you could go back over your \u2014what you said about the plans for tapering later this June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  21 of 28   year.  And why isn \u2019t tapering a tightening?   It seems that many people in the markets just as soon as you talk taper \u2014will taper \u2014are just going to push forward when you\u2014they think that first rate hike will come .  Thank you\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, as I tr ied to explain in my opening remarks, our pla ns depend on the economic scenario and how it evolves .  And what I tr ied to do is explain how our asset purchases would evolve if , sort of , the modal, the most likely forecast , were to , in fact , take place, which , of cou rse, it won \u2019t exactly take place, s omething else will no doubt  happen.  But again, our basic forecast is one which is basically , as was pointed out earlier by Mr. Hilsenrath, a moderately optimistic forecast, where growth picks  up as we pass through this period of fiscal restraint; where un employment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last September \u2014and we have made som e progress since last September ; and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent .  Those are the conditions that define this sort of baseline forecast .  In that case then, as I described it, we would expect probably to slow or moderate purchases some time later this year, and then through the middle of \u2014through  the early part of next year , and ending , in that scenario , somewhere in  the middle of the year .  Aga in though, it \u2019s very important to understand that that\u2019 s\u2014if we do that, that would basically say that , you know , that we \u2019ve had a relatively decent economic outcome in terms of sustained improvement in growth and unemployment .  If things are worse, we would do more .  If things are better, we will do less .   I think I would\u2014to answer your other question\u2014 I would draw the analogy:  If the Federal Reserve in normal times lowers the federal funds rate by 25 basis points , but some traders think that \u2014were  expecting 50 basis points, then there might be a sense that the financial conditions have tightened somewhat .  But nevertheless, I think you would say that if the Fed cut the funds rate by 25 basis points , that that was an easing of policy .  And, by the same t oken, as June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  22 of 28   long as we \u2019re buying assets , we are adding to our holdings .  We do believe \u2014although, you know, there \u2019s room for debate \u2014we do believe that the primary effect of our purchases is through the stock that we hold, because that stock has been withdrawn from markets , and the prices of those assets have to adju st to balance supply and demand.  A nd we \u2019ve taken out some of the supply , and so the prices go up, the yields go down.  So, that , seems to me , consistent with the idea that we\u2019 re still adding liquidity , we\u2019re still adding accommodation to the system.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Ryan Avent, The Economist \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Hi.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, I \u2019m trying to sort of understand the view with rela tion to these inflation  figures .  I\u2019m a little surprised at how , I guess , blas\u00e9 the C ommittee seems about them , with the exception of President Bullard.  Inflation looks remarkably low on both core and headline, PCE  and CPI .  Your projections have it at \u2014rising , the core PC E rising , to at most 2 percent in 2015.  You say that inflation expectations have remained sort of within the range that the Fed has  traditionally  been comfortable with , but they have fallen by a good \u00bd percentage point .  And , as y ou know , that when interest rates are stuck at the zero lower bound, a decline in inflation expectations sort of  translates into an increase in real rates .  Why is the Fed not more concerned about this?  It seem s to me that earlier in the  recovery, they were more concerned about declines in  inflation like this .  And wouldn\u2019 t you say that , even if you \u2019re happy with the pace of labor market recovery, th at, other things equal, this sort of inflation performance suggest s that you should be pushing harder on the acceler ator\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  I don\u2019 t disagree with anything you said .  I think low \u2014inflation that\u2019 s too low is a problem .  It increases the risk of deflation .  It raises real interest rates .  It means that debt de leveraging takes place more slowly .  Now, there \u2019s always issues about, you June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  23 of 28   know, why is it low?   And , as I pointed out, there are a few reasons that are probably not that meaningful economically \u2014for example, the temporary movement in medical prices, the temporary movements in nonmarket prices, thi ngs of that sort .  I mean, after all , the CPI is somewhat higher .  And so we expect inflation to come back up, that \u2019s our forecast .  But I don\u2019 t want \u2014I think it \u2019s entirely wrong to say we \u2019re not concerned about it .  We are concerned about it.  W e would like to get inflation up to our target , and that will be a factor in our thinking about the thresholds .  It will be a factor in our thinking about asset purchases .  And, you know, we \u2019ve got a dual mandate, and it \u2019s maximum employment and price stability .  And there\u2019 s a reason why we define price stability as a positive inflation rate, not zero, because we believe that in order to best maximize the mandate, we need to have enough inflation so that there is , in fact, you know, some room for real interest rates to move .  So, I don\u2019 t disagree with your basic argument . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks, Mr. Chairman, Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers .  Since you\u2019ve referred to Mr. Hilsenrath, is he the real power behind the throne?  That\u2019s one of the questions we all have .   You had mentioned on several occasions now that quantitative easing is designed to kind of spur economic \u2014drive down the yields , force more risk -taking that flows through the economy .  There had been debate a couple of years ago at the beg inning of this about whether it was inflating commodity prices .  Inflation as a whole is subdued, but oil prices are \u2014anchor ed somewhere around $99\u2014$93 to $99.  We were told on ce we have domestic production \u2014we have record production now \u2014that th at would be a signal to bring prices down.  It hasn \u2019t happened.  Brazil has got people on the streets be cause of inflation.  To what degree do you think quantitative easing is actually inflating commodity prices , and have you been able to filter that June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  24 of 28   out?  And any thoughts on wage grow th and why that \u2019s been so flat when everything else seems to be doing good in the economy?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, when we \u2014as I recall, I believe I have this right \u2014when we introduced the second round of LSAPs , properly known as QE2, in , I think, November 2010, there was a lot of increase in commodity prices at that time , and there was a lot of complaining that the Fed is pumping up commodity prices , and that that \u2019s a negative for people around the world.  And we argued at the time that the effect s of the Federal Reserve\u2019 s policy on global commodity prices was probably pr etty small , and that it operated \u2014to the extent it did have an effect \u2014it operated through growth\u2014mos tly through growth expectations .  That is , a stronger global economy tends to dri ve up commodity prices .   This time around, we \u2019ve purchased , and are in the process of purchasi ng, a lot more than we did in so- called QE2 .  We haven \u2019t really seen much increase in commodity prices .  Commodity prices are way off their peaks of early last year.  Oil is a little bit different from others in  that it \u2019s kind of hung up.  But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets \u2014China, the rest of Asia , and some other parts of the worl d\u2014plus Europe , of course , are softer , and so global commodity demand is weaker .  And that explains , I think, the bulk of why commodity prices have not risen so much.  So I think that \u2019s all consistent with our story that the effect of asset purchases on com modity prices \u2014I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s  zero, but I don \u2019t think that it\u2019 s nearly as bi g as some folks have suggested.  In terms of wages, I think that \u2019s mostly consistent with our view that unemployment , at 7.6 percent , is still pretty far from where we should be satisfied .  Maximum employment, we think, is , again , between 5 and 6 percent , although these are very difficult numbers to estimate .  June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  25 of 28   So, very weak wage growth, except in a few places and a few narrow occupation s, is indicative to me of a  labor market that remains quite slack and where, you know, that justifies , I think\u2014together with low inflation \u2014justifies why we are maintaining a highly accommodative  policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, Kate Davidson from Politico .

Thank you, Chairman .  Recently , we have seen great volatility in Japanese market \u2014equity, JGB , and foreign exchange .  Some say this volatility is  due to un certainty to the Federal Reserve \u2019s monetary policy direction , but other s say this is due to lack of confidence to the Bank of Japan \u2019s monetary  policy .  So how do you view the Bank of Japan\u2019 s efforts?  Do you still support Bank of Japan policy?  And other question is , how much do you pay attention to the spillover effect to the international market when you consider exit strategy?  June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  26 of 28 \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, I think the volatility is mostly linked to the Bank of Japan \u2019s efforts , and that would seem logical , since in earlier episodes , when the Fed was doing asset purchases and the BOJ was not doing an ything, there was no volatility .  So it sort of seems logical that the change here is the change in BOJ policy .   The BOJ is fighting against a  very difficult , entrenched deflation.  And , of course, deflation has been a problem in Japan for many, many years , which means that expectations are very much \u2014the public \u2019s expectations are for continuing deflation, and therefore it takes very aggressive policies to break those expectations  and to  get inflation up to the 2 percent target that the Bank of Japan has set .   So that \u2019s why it \u2019s difficult, they \u2019ve had to be very aggressive .  That aggressiveness in the early stages of this process , where investors are still learn ing about the BOJ \u2019s reaction function, it\u2019s not all that surprising that there \u2019s volatility .  Also, the JGB markets are less liquid than , say, the T reasury market , for example.  So I \u2014you know, I think that \u2019s something they need to pay close attention to , but, on the whole, I think that it is important for Japan to attack deflation.  And I also agree with the \u201c three arrows, \u201d the idea that besides breaking deflation , it\u2019s important to address fiscal  and structural issues as well .  So, I \u2019m supportive of my c olleague , Mr. Kuroda, and I\u2019m supportive of what Japan is doing , even though it does have some effects on our economy as well.   The\u2014there are a lot of reasons why emerging markets and other countries experience capital inflows and volatility .  Some of them have to do with changes in growth expectations .  For example, we \u2019ve seen a lot of changes in growth patterns in the emerging markets recently .  Some of it has  to do with risk- on, risk- off behavior , and some of it probably does have to do with monetary policy in  advanced economies , which include s, of course , the United States .  We do June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  27 of 28   take it \u2014pay attention to that .  I frequently meet with colleagues from emerging markets at  the G-20, for example, and we discuss  these issues .  I think the right way to think about  it is that, as the G -7 and the G -20 both have noted, that what U .S. monetary policy , like that of Japan , is trying to do is trying to help this economy grow .  And a global recovery, a global \u2014strong global growth depends very much on the U .S. growing at a reasonable rate.  And so, while there is some effect, I think the net effect , including a stronger U .S. economy , is, on the whole , positive, and I think most of my colleagues in emerging markets  recognize that .  That being said , anything we can do through communication or other means to try to minimize any overflow effects or side effects, we will certainly do.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hello Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.com .  You know, you \u2019ve talked about being i n uncharted territory with policy , and we can remember that these news conferences  just bega n about two years ago as well , and so there \u2019s that mix of communication and  policy .  Insofar as the FOMC decided not to include the information a bout adjusting the asset purchases today, how do you walk that fine line ?  And why did the FOMC decide essentially to leave it to you to describe that, as opposed to putting it down in its own words?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  .  Well , again, we don \u2019t think of this as a change in policy .  What I was deputized to do, if you will, was to try to make somewhat clearer the implications of our existing policy and to try to explain better how the policy would evolve in various economic scenarios , and that \u2019s a little bit difficult to put into, you know, a very terse FOMC statement .  Now that being said , going forward, I think that, yo u know, some of these elements, to the extent that we can make them useful , will begin to appear in the FOMC statement .  It\u2019s enti rely possible .  But it seemed like the right tactic in this case to explain these fairly subtle June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL  28 of 28   contingencies in a context where I could answer questions and respond to any misunderstandings that might occur.

The labor market has improved, with gains in private payroll employment, contributing to increases in consumer confidence and household spending.The 19 participants in the policy discussion submitted individual economic projections, showing expectations of moderate growth, declining unemployment rates, and gradually increasing inflation. The Federal Reserve is reviewing principles for normalizing policy and intends to provide more information in the future.In the view of most participants, the broad principles set out in June 2011 are still applicable, but one difference worth mentioning is that a strong majority now expects the Committee to not sell agency mortgage-backed securities during the process of normalizing monetary policy. However, these matters are unlikely to be relevant to actual policy for quite a while, as the Committee continues its highly accommodative policies due to elevated unemployment and inflation below the Committee's objective.The FOMC reaffirmed its expectation that the current low interest rate will remain until the unemployment rate is above 6\u00c2\u00bd percent, as long as inflation remains stable. The Committee emphasized that economic conditions and inflation outlook will determine when the federal funds rate target will increase, and that any increases will likely be gradual.The FOMC has made no changes to its current purchase program of agency mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities, but has stated that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve. If economic data align with expectations, the Committee anticipates moderating the monthly pace of purchases later this year and continuing to reduce the pace in measured steps through the first half of next year.The Federal Reserve's policy is not predetermined and will depend on incoming data and progress towards objectives. If conditions improve faster than expected, asset purchases could be reduced more quickly, but if the outlook becomes less favorable, reductions could be delayed. The Committee is prepared to use all tools, including increasing the pace of purchases, to promote maximum employment. Even with a reduction in asset purchases, the Federal Reserve's portfolio will not shrink, but only slow the pace of adding to it. The large holdings will continue to lower long-term interest rates. Slowing the pace of purchases is like letting up on the gas pedal, not applying the brakes. The Committee's decisions on asset purchases are separate from its guidance on the federal funds rate target, which is likely to remain appropriate for a while after asset purchases end. If the data supports a sustainable economy, the pace of purchases will gradually be reduced.The Federal Reserve believes that it is not yet necessary to raise short-term rates, as the need to do so is still far off. Regardless of how conditions may change, the Federal Reserve is dedicated to improving the labor market while maintaining price stability.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Is the decision to gradually reduce purchases and end it next year when the unemployment rate hits 7 percent a decision by the FOMC?\n'ANSWER': No, it is not a policy change. It is simply a clarification to help people understand how policy will evolve. Future policy statements may include elements of this, but it is not a policy change. The intention is to explain how the FOMC is working towards improving the labor market and considering alternative policy and economic developments.", "'QUESTION': So there is no consensus on that? That's not a vote of the FOMC, that's not a plan that's written down some place or \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n'ANSWER': It represents the consensus of the FOMC, yes.", "'QUESTION': Could you provide information on what constitutes \"substantial improvement\" in the labor market?\n'ANSWER': We consider various factors such as participation, payrolls, and other data to assess the state of the labor market. While the 7 percent unemployment rate is not the sole indicator, it is a significant measure of progress towards achieving substantial improvement.", "'QUESTION': Where does the optimism in the Fed's forecast come from and how confident are they that these expectations will be met?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is optimistic because the housing sector is now supporting growth, creating construction jobs and increasing household wealth. State and local governments are no longer laying off workers, and financial conditions are improving. The main drag on growth is federal fiscal policy, but despite this, the economy is still moving ahead at a moderate pace. The Fed's policies will adjust depending on how the economy evolves.", "'QUESTION': Why have bond yields gone up and how could this affect the economic outlook and the housing market recovery?\n'ANSWER': Bond yields have increased due to more optimism about the economy and perceptions of the Federal Reserve. While higher mortgage rates could impact the housing market, increased optimism about rising house prices helps compensate for this. If interest rates rise for the right reasons, such as optimism about the economy and accurate monetary policy assessment, it can be beneficial.", "'QUESTION': How do you reconcile the sharp rise in real interest rates with the belief that it's the stock of assets the Federal Reserve holds that affects long-term interest rates? Do you think the market is correctly interpreting the future path of the Federal Reserve's stock of assets?\n\n'ANSWER': The rise in real interest rates cannot be fully explained by changes in the stock of asset purchases. Other factors, such as optimism about the economy and uncertainty, are also at play. It is difficult to judge if the markets are in sync, but generally, the Committee's thinking aligns with analysts and market participants. It is important to understand that our policies are dependent on economic conditions, and we may adjust our policy if financial conditions deviate from the expected economic scenario.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree with President Obama's assessment that you stayed in your position as chairman for longer than you wanted to and maybe longer than you were supposed to? Can you update us on any conversations you've had with him about your future?\n'ANSWER': I would like to keep the debate, discussion, and questions here on policy. I don't have anything for you on my personal plans.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide a deeper explanation on thresholds and triggers?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke agrees to provide a deeper explanation on thresholds and triggers.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain if the threshold for raising rates is too high and if the unemployment rate accurately represents the state of the labor market?\n'ANSWER': The 6.5 percent unemployment rate is a threshold, not a trigger, for raising rates. Factors such as inflation and the state of the labor market, including underemployment and reduced participation, will be taken into account before raising rates. The threshold may be adjusted, but likely to be lowered, not raised.", "'QUESTION': Why are you cutting off asset purchases before seeing substantial improvement in the labor market?\n'ANSWER': We view ourselves as having two tools - rate policy and asset purchases. Asset purchases are unconventional policy with certain risks and uncertainties. Our target is maximum employment, not a specific unemployment rate. Stopping asset purchases won't end the stimulus because we will hold onto the portfolio, which will continue to put downward pressure on interest rates.", "'QUESTION': Is the decrease in bond market measures of longer-term inflation expectations a concern for the Committee?\n'ANSWER': The decrease in bond market measures of longer-term inflation expectations is not a concern at this point. There are transitory factors contributing to the low inflation rate, and inflation expectations still remain within the historical range. However, if inflation does not gradually return towards the 2 percent objective, measures will be taken to address it.", "'QUESTION': Given the recent market volatility and the emphasis on forward guidance, are you concerned that some people are not understanding your message and do you think this will make your exit strategy more challenging?\n'ANSWER': It is important for us to communicate, especially in this unusual economic situation where standard relationships are not applying. Our policies are tied to the outlook and we will provide additional support if needed. We hope to increase confidence among market participants, investors, and consumers by being clear in our communication.", "'QUESTION': Can you provide an update on the progress of the rulemakings under the Dodd-Frank Act and do you still expect them to be completed by the end of the year?\n'ANSWER': The rulemakings have taken time due to their complexity and the need for coordination among multiple agencies. However, significant progress has been made on major rules such as Basel III and the Volcker rule, and they are expected to be completed this year. The implementation process will still take time for financial institutions to adjust their practices.", "'QUESTION': Could you comment on the speculation that you may not be staying on the job for another term and explain why you are not attending the Jackson Hole conference this year?\n'ANSWER': I will not comment on my personal plans, but I want to clarify that the Jackson Hole conference is not a Federal Reserve Systemwide conference. It is sponsored by one of the 12 Reserve Banks. I attend various conferences and meetings to engage with constituents from different Reserve Banks.", "'QUESTION': Could there be a conflict between the asset purchase program and the funds rate guidance policy?\n'ANSWER': The Chairman hopes the unemployment rate comes down quickly enough that this becomes a problem. The policy assumptions may not be the same for each individual, so the threshold of 6.5% for the unemployment rate is not a trigger. The majority of FOMC participants still expect rates to be low at the end of 2015, considering factors such as inflation and labor market conditions.", "'QUESTION': How focused is the Federal Reserve on mortgage-backed securities and the larger world market for them?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve pays close attention to market functioning and believes the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market is still healthy. They are a fraction of total MBS holdings and their purchases are not disrupting the market. The events of five years ago may lead to changes in the MBS market in the future.", "'QUESTION': Is there a concern that removing government backing of mortgage-backed securities would change the nature of getting a mortgage in America?\n'ANSWER': These issues are being debated and there are bills in Congress that would change the GSEs. It is possible that if there is a major change in the government's role, we might see a different structure in mortgages. Other countries have different structures and similar home ownership rates, so a different structure may be better for some people.", "'QUESTION': Why isn't tapering considered a tightening?\n'ANSWER': Tapering is not considered a tightening because it is a gradual reduction in asset purchases, not a complete withdrawal. The primary effect of the purchases is through the stock that the Federal Reserve holds, which adds liquidity and accommodation to the system.", "'QUESTION': Hi Chairman Bernanke, Ryan Avent from The Economist here. Can you provide an update on the current state of the economy and any potential risks or challenges that you see going forward?\n'ANSWER': The economy is recovering at a moderate pace, with improvements in labor market and household spending. However, risks include the ongoing European debt crisis and potential fiscal tightening in the US. We will continue to monitor these factors and take appropriate actions to support economic growth.", "'QUESTION': Why is the Fed not more concerned about low inflation and the decline in inflation expectations?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Bernanke acknowledges that low inflation is a problem as it increases the risk of deflation, raises real interest rates, and slows down debt deleveraging. The Fed is concerned about low inflation and wants to get it up to their target, which will factor into their thinking about thresholds and asset purchases. They believe that having some inflation is necessary to maximize their dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.", "'QUESTION': To what degree do you think quantitative easing is actually inflating commodity prices, and have you been able to filter that out? And any thoughts on wage growth and why that's been so flat when everything else seems to be doing good in the economy?\n'ANSWER': The effect of asset purchases on commodity prices is not as big as suggested, as global commodity demand is weaker due to softer emerging markets and Europe. Weak wage growth is indicative of a labor market that remains slack, which justifies maintaining a highly accommodative policy.", "'QUESTION': Do you think FSOC should defer to the SEC or still press for more to be done regarding the money market fund proposal?\n'ANSWER': I'm glad to see the SEC taking up money market reform, as it is their area of expertise. While we haven't reviewed their proposal in detail, the floating NAV proposal is similar to one of the suggestions from FSOC. I hope the final proposal will effectively stabilize money market funds.", "'QUESTION': How do you view the Bank of Japan's efforts and do you still support their policy? How much attention do you pay to the spillover effect to the international market when considering exit strategy?\n'ANSWER': The volatility in the Japanese market is mostly linked to the Bank of Japan's efforts to fight deflation. It is important for Japan to attack deflation and I support their aggressive policies. While there are some effects on our economy, the net effect is positive. We pay attention to the spillover effects and try to minimize any side effects.", "'QUESTION': How does the FOMC walk the fine line between communication and policy, and why did they leave it to the Chairman to describe the decision not to include information about adjusting asset purchases?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC sees it as clarifying existing policy rather than a change. The Chairman was tasked with explaining the implications and evolution of the policy in different economic scenarios, which is difficult to do in a brief FOMC statement. However, some of these elements may be included in future statements. The decision to have the Chairman explain the contingencies allows for better understanding and addressing any misunderstandings."]}
