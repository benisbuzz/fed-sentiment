.  Sam Fleming from the  Financial Times .  One of the big uncertainties hangin g over markets right now is clearly the vote in the United Kingdom next week.   How much of a factor was that in today \u2019s decision , relative to the questions you \u2019ve    elucidated about, the  domest ic jobs numbers and inflation data ?  And could you talk a little bit about the channels that you think about when you talk about the potential impact of a  Brexit on the U .S. economy?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, Brexit, the upcoming U .K. decision on whether or not to leave the European Union, is something we discuss ed, and I think it \u2019s fair to say that it was one of the factors that factored into today \u2019s decisions \u2014clearly this is  a very important decision for the United Kingdom and for Europe.  It is a decision that could have consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets.  If it does so, it could have consequences in turn for the U .S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy.  So it is certainly one of the uncertainties that we discussed an d that factored in to today \u2019s decision.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  The F ed\u2019s outlook for ra tes has come down sharply for 2018 especially, but it \u2019s been coming down gradually over  time \u2014almost a  full percentage point in som e cases , compared to a year ago \u2014and  yet the GDP outlook remai ns the same.  W hat has happened i n, say , just the past quarter to the Committee \u2019s outlook for rates to bring it down so much for, say , 2018, where it \u2019s now just  2.4 percent and further from the long run than it was , say, in the pr ior estimate that was out there ?  Has there been a dramatic change in the Committee \u2019s view on the relationship of GDP to rates?  And mayb e you c ould also explain why the F ed has to keep lowering these rates and getting that forecast wrong \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: S o, as I mentioned in my opening remarks , there is really a great deal of uncertainty around each individual \u2019s assessment of the appropriate level of rates , particularly as we go further out in the forecast horizon and when we come to the long term .  And I think what we can see, and what many econometric and other studies  show , is that the so -called neutral    rate\u2014namely , the level of  the federal funds rate that is consistent with the economy growing roughly a t trend a nd operating near full employment\u2014t hat rat e is quite depressed by historical standards.  Many estimates would put it, in real or inflation -adjusted terms , near zero.  Now, the path that you see in the dot plot for rates over time is importantly influenced \u2014there is accommodation , and as we achieve our objectives, I think most participants feel that the accommodation in the current stance of policy needs to be gradually removed, but a very important influence in the out years is , what will happen to that neutral rate that will just keep the economy operating on an even keel?  And I \u2019ve often in my statements and remarks talked about headwinds that reflect lingering effects of the financial crisis ; to the extent that there are headwinds, I think many of us expect that these headwinds would gradually dim inish over  time, and that \u2019s a reason why you see the upward path for rates.  But there are also more long -lasting or persistent factors that may be at work that are holding down the longer -run level of n eutral rates \u2014for example, slow  productivi ty growth, which is not just a  U.S. phenomenon but a global phenomenon.  You know, obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will  happen to productivity growth, but  productivity growth could stay long for  a prolonged time , and we have an aging\u2014aging societies  in many parts of the world that could depress this neutral rate.1  And I think all of us are involved in a process of constantly reevaluating where is that neutral rate going , and I think what you see is a downward shift in that assessment over  time , the sense that maybe more of what \u2019s causing  this neutral rate to be low are factors that are not g oing to be rapidly disappearing  but will be part of the new normal.  Now,                                                  1 Chair Yellen intended to say, \u201c You know, obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen to productivity growth, but productivity growth could stay low for a prolonged time, and we have an aging \u2014aging societies in many parts of the world that could depress this neutral rate. \u201d     you still see an  assessment that that neutral rate will move up somewhat, but it has bee n coming down, and I think it continues to be marked lower .  And it is highly uncertain, for all of the dots.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, I\u2019m Jason Lang e with Reuters .  The median participant forecast for the fed funds rate for 2017 and 2018 came down quite dramatically, b ut this stands in contrast with the 2016 meeting forecast.  As you mentioned, there were a number \u2014actually , six\u2014participants who saw only one rate hike this year.  Can you comment on what it would take for two rate increases to be a \u2014the  likely or appropriate policy path?  And about this disconnect between the median view and the view of the, say, the voting members of the C ommittee?   If there is one, I should add.  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, I \u2019m not going to comment on participants versus voters.  You know, mone tary policy \u2014the Committee feels that mon etary policy \u2014when we are looking at several years, we should show the public what the views are of all the participants in the Committee , especially given that voting \u2014voting rotates every year, and so that \u2019s a decision we made.  But you asked me what it would take to have two increases.  So, you know, the Committee as a whole never discusses , how many increases should we have this year or next year\u2014that \u2019s not a decision we \u2019re making as a Committee.  We \u2019re making decisions on a meeting -by-meeting basis and trying to give a sense to the public of what we \u2019re looking for and what the basis of a decision will be.  And , as I indicated, first of all, internationa l uncertainties loom large here;  we mentioned Brexit , the U.K. decision, obviously how that turns out is something that will factor into future decisions.  And we \u2019re also looking at the prospects for economic growth and continued progress in the labor market.  The forecast t hat you see in the SEP and the statement indicate the  Committee continues to expect w e will have moderate    growth, 2 percent growth \u2014so , you know, suggest s healthy growth for the rest of the year and a pickup i n growth in the second quarter , and we expect to  see continuing progress in the labor  market.  Now, we had ques tions about the growth outlook because we did see slower growth in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter.  I have to say there , with respect to the slowdown we saw in consumer spending , that seemed to be out of line with fundamentals.  We expected it to pick up, and we \u2019ve seen very good evidence that it has picked up .  But now , the labor mark et appears to have slowed down, a nd we need to assure ourselves that the underlying momentum in the economy has not diminished.  So, as I said, we will be carefully assessing data on the labor market to make sure that job gains are going to continue at  a pace sufficient to result in further improvement in the labor market.  And we will be watching the  spending data to make sure growth is picking up in line with our expectations . Of cour se, with respect to inflation , we\u2019re constantly evaluating whether or not incoming information is roughly in line with our expectations.  So we will be ev aluating that a t every meeting ; every meeting  is live , and we could make a decision at any m eeting to adjust the funds rate, but that \u2019s the kind of thing that we will want to see to make such decisions\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  The  Fed created a labor m arket c onditions i ndex  a couple of years ago that was designed to sort of bring together a lot of these factors in the labor m arket that you\u2019 ve talked about .  As I\u2019m sure you know , it\u2019s been falling since January.  That suggests to some people that it was your decision to raise  rates in December that has caused this weakening in the labor market .  Could you address what role , if any , you think the F ed\u2019s decision to raise rates has played in the slowdown we are now seeing?   \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, let me just say the l abor market c onditions i ndex is a kind of experimental research product that \u2019s a summary measu re of many different indicators , and, essentially , that measure tries to assess the change in the labor market conditions.  As I look at it , and as that index  looks at things, t he state of the labor market is still healthy, but there \u2019s been something of a loss of momentum :  The  200,000 jobs a month we saw, for example, in the first quarter of the year , that \u2019s slowed in recent months. Exactly what the reasons are for that slowing,  it\u2019s difficult to say.  It may turn out \u2014you know, again, we should never pay  too much attention to, for example, one job market report.  There\u2019s a large error around that , we often see large revisions, w e should not overblow the significance of one data p oint, especially when other  indicators of the labor market are still flashing green :  Initial claims for une mployment insurance remain low ; perceptions of the labor market remain fine; d ata from the JOLTS  on job openings continue to reach new highs.  So there\u2019 s a good deal of incoming data that does  signal c ontinued progress and strength in the labor market, but, as I say, it does bear  watching.  So, the C ommittee doesn \u2019t feel and doesn \u2019t expect , and I don\u2019 t expect , that labor market \u2014progress in the labor  market has come to an end.  We have tried to make clear to the public and through our actions and through the revisions you see \u2014have seen over time in the dot plot\u2014that we do not have a fixed plan for raising rates over time .  We look at incoming data and  are prepared to adjust our view s to keep the economy on track, and , in light of that data dependence of our policy , I really don \u2019t think that a single rate increase of 25 basis points in December has any\u2014has had much significance for the outlook.  And we will continue to adjust our thinking in light of incoming data in  whatever direction is appropriate.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Yellen, I want to come back to these longer -run rate projections that you \u2019ve been asked about.  So, yields on 10- year T reasury notes  have fallen below 1.6 percent; on 5- year notes, they \u2019re near 1 percent.  Elsewhere in the world, in Germany and Japan, long -term bond yields are negative.  Does \u2014how do you explain this low level of long-term bond yields?  And does it give you any pause in looking at your own projections and coming to a conclusion about whether those projections are possibly still way too high when the bond market is at a much lower level?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I think the levels of longer -term rates reflect essentially two things.  One is market expectations about the path of short -term rates over , if we \u2019re considering, say, a 10-year T reasury security, what would be the path of short -term rates over the next 10 years.  And the second factor is the so- called term premium , or th e extra yield that investors demand in order to hold a longer -term security instead of to invest short term.  And clearly, market expectations for the path of short -term interest rates over the next 10 years remain low , and that is a factor.  That is an important factor that \u2019s, I think, holding down the level of longer -term yields.   But, perhaps a s important , or maybe even more important , the term premium is also low and has probably come down.  Now, when we engaged in longer -term asset purchases, our very purpose in doing that was to drive down l onger -term yields by making these  asset s scarce \u2014scarcer  and, hence, more valuable to the public that wants to invest in long -term securities , and we were consciously attempting to drive down that term premium. Now, we continue to hold a  large quantity of those securities, but we \u2019re not adding to them.   But, in many parts of the world\u2014the ECB , for example, and the B ank of Japan  are also engaging in quantitative easing , buying longer -term assets and pushing down those term premia.  So I think term premia are very low as well as the expected path of short rates .  \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Do these yield levels give you any uncertainty , any doubt about whether \u2014are you going to be able to get rates  to where projections say they \u2019re going?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, so I want to say again, w e\u2019re quite uncertain about where rates are heading in the longer term.  We write down our best estimates a t this time of what is a longer -run normal level of the federa l funds rate , and those are numbers about which there is great uncertainty.  As I said, we have good reason to believe that the so- called neutral rate or rate compatible with the economy operating at full employment is low at  the present time.  And many of us believe , as a base case, it\u2019 s reasonable to assume that those rates will move up over time, but we \u2019re not certain of that.  It is\u2014it\u2019s one of the uncertainties that \u2014and there could be revisions in either direction, but thus far, in recent S EPs, I\u2019d say  the revisions have mainly been \u2014have been in the downward direction.  The idea that a low neutral rate may  be more \u2014closer to the new normal, but you still do see some reversion.  So we \u2019re really quite uncertain about that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: In your speech in Philadelphia, you called the slowdown in job growth last month \u201c concerning ,\u201d and you mentioned today that you want to verify that the underlying momentum in  the economy and in the labor market is still continuing.  What do you need to see  to convince you that the labor market is  still movi ng toward full employment , and  for how long would you need to see it?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I can \u2019t give you a formula , I know you would probably like to have a number that \u2019s a cutoff for what we need to see in a particular report.  There are a lot of different indicators of the labor market \u2014for example, the l abor m arket c onditions i ndex that Binya  referred to has 19 different indicators.  Clearly, we will be looking at the next job report , and if we were to s ee a healthy pace of job growth, you know, above that needed to kind of    maintain the status quo i n the labor market.  So, you know, I should say, over  time, we should expect to see, as the economy comes closer to maximum employment, the likely pace of job gains is probably going to slow  down somewhat.  And we have seen some slowing.  But the recent couple of months was very low and, arguably , not eve n at the pace we need to see to  maintain stable labor market conditions.  So we want to see an adequate pace of job creation.  There might be revisions to previous months that would change our views , but there will be other surveys of employment intentions and other indicators of the labor market that w e\u2019ll focus \u2014we\u2019ll be focusing on.  So, there is no formula for what it takes, but we will be looking at the labor market.  Did you want to follow up?\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: So rry, I had a quick follow -up.  Also in your speech in Philadelphia, you did not say that you felt that it would be probably appr opriate for a rate hike to occur in the coming months.  Do you \u2014did you intentionally leave that out?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: You know, we do need to make sure that there is sufficient momentum.  I don\u2019 t know what the timetable is going to be to gain that assurance.  Every meeting is live ; there is no meeting that is off the table , that \u2014no meeting is out in terms of a possible rate increase.  But, we really need to look at the data , and I can \u2019t prespecify a timetable.  So I\u2019m, you know, not comfortable to say it \u2019s in the next meeting or two, but it could be, it could be, it \u2019s not impossible.  It\u2019s not impossible that b y July, for example, we would see data that led us to believe that we \u2019re on a perfectly fine course, and that data was an aberration , and other concerns  would have passed\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Ma \u2019am, Peter Barnes, Fox Business.  Hi.  We are in  an election season , and in the past, the F ed has been sensitive to making policy changes in election years.  You have three more meetings before the November presidential election.  Could you comment    on whether or not the election will come into play , and any concern that if you change p olicy ahead of the election and, based on your forec ast today, you obviously  could\u2014a re you concerned that that cou ld then lead to charges that the F ed is trying to change policy to influence the outcome of the election, because the Fed  has been sensitive to that in the past?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So we are very focused on ass essing the economic outlook and making changes that are appropriate without taking politics into account.  Look, if the data \u2014incoming data were, in the coming months , to justify the kind of gradual increases that we  have long discussed, that we see a s appr opriate in light of the outlook, I think market s should not be surprised by such a decision if we make it.

You mentioned in your remarks at the beginning that we are getting a slightly different signal when you look at inflation versus when you look at inflation expectations.  Could you detail a little bit wh ich you look at and sort of weight  more?  Are you more concerned with the inflation expectations or focusing more on the slight pickup in actual  inflation?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN:  Well, we \u2019re looking at both.  You know, I would say, with respect to the behavior of inflation, inflation is behaving roughly in the manner I would have expected;  I have really not seen significant surprises there.  W e\u2019ve long said th at an important reason that inflation is as low as it\u2019 s been is b ecause of past declines in  energy prices a nd increases in the value of the dollar , and as those factors began to dissipate, we would see inflation moving up.  Now, that \u2019s exactly what we\u2019 re seeing, what we\u2019 re\u2014that \u2019s in line with our thinking and with the data.  So, those things have stabilized, th eir influence is  dissipating.     And with respect to c ore inflation, which\u2014now , that \u2019s partly influenced also by the dollar , but t rying to pull out the dollar and  import price influence \u2014core inflation seems to be behaving roughly as one would expect with well -anchored inflation expectations and in improving labor markets.  So I \u2019m not seeing anything \u2014inflation , even core inflation, is running under 2 percent .  I continue to think the evidence supports a projection that it will move up over the n ext couple of ye ars back toward  our 2  percent  objective.  But, we \u2019ve seen in the past , and economic theory suggests , that inflation expectations are relevant to price and wage setting decisions.  So we do monitor indicators of inflation expectations carefully.  Now, it \u2019s very hard to know exactly what inflation expectations are relevant to actual price and wage decisions.  And so, for example, we have seen the Michigan survey, a measure of household inflation expectations , move down.  It\u2019s hard \u2014that \u2019s a preliminary numbe r, it\u2019s hard to know what to make of it.  We \u2019ve certainly taken  note of i t.  But survey -based measures that \u2014where forecasters are queried \u2014have really all been quite stable.  And measures of inflation compensation\u2014 I always try to be careful to call it \u201cinflation compensation\u201d  rather than \u201cinflation expectations \u201d because they \u2019re not inflation expectations.  Inflation expectations influence those market measures, but there \u2019s also an inflation risk premium.  And there are actually good reasons to think that the  inflation risk premium could have decline d significantly and may  be depressing those measures.

In there, they showed\u2014they seem ed to show that there was an active discussion of a possible June rate increase, somethi ng that we hadn\u2019t gotten from the policy statement that was issued right after the meeting.  Was that a    conscious decision to hold back and tell us in\u2014when the minutes came out about the June discussion?  And if so, could you tell us what surprises we coul d see in the June minute s\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So the minutes are always \u2014have to be an accurate discussion of what happened at the meeting.  So they \u2019re not changed after the fact in order to correct possible misconceptions.  There was a good deal of discussion at that meeting of the possibility of moving in June , and that appeared in the minutes.  I suppose in the April statement, we gave no obvious hint or  kind of calendar -based signal that June was a possibility.  But I think if you look at the statement, we pointed to slower growth but pointed out that the fundamentals \u2014there was no obvious fundamental reason for growth to have slowed.  And we pointed to fundamentals underlying household spending decisions that remained on solid ground, suggesting that maybe this was something transitory that would disappear.  We noted that labor market conditions continued to improve in line with our expectations , and we did downgrade somewhat our expressions of concern about the global risk environment.  So I do think that ther e were hints in the April statement that the C ommittee was changing its views of what it was seeing in a direction.  We continue to say that we think, if economic developments evolve in line with our expectations, the gradual and cautious further increases  we expect to be appropriate.  And I suppose I was somewhat surprised with the market interpretation of it.   But the June  meeting  minute s\u2014the minu tes of the April meeting were an accurate summary of what had happened.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jeremy Tordjman with the AFP news agency.  The F ed has repeatedly voiced its concern over the slow pace of wa ge growth, a nd I was wondering, do you think that increasing the federal minimum wage could be of any help ?  Could it boost the higher wages and eventually drive up the inflation?   \n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So I think that the minimum wage incre ases that have gone into effect \u2014estimates that I \u2019ve seen suggest it\u2019s a relatively minor influence on the aggregate level of wage inflation.  I would take somewhat faster wage increases  to be a sign  that labor market slack is diminishing and that the labor market is approaching conditions that are consistent with maximum employment.  So, I think, you know, I think we have seen some hints, perhaps preliminary indications , that wage growth  is picking up.  And as much as anything, I think it \u2019s a sign of a  generally healthy labor market, which is what our  mandated objective is, to achieve maximum employment.  And so it would be a symptom of it.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  There\u2019 s been a lot of discussion in last couple months about the slow pace of demand in the global economy, a nd some economists think that central banks should think about using helicopter money, maybe in Japan first or Europe first.  But then, former Fed Chairma n Ben Bernanke weighed in saying that he thought it  would be a good thing for the F ed to put helicopter money in its toolkit in case there was a downturn in the United States.  So I \u2019d like to get your comments on that.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So , in normal times, I think it\u2019 s very important that there  be a separation between monetary and fiscal policy , and it \u2019s a primary reason for independence of a central bank.  We have seen all too many examples of countries that end up with high or even hyperinflation because those in charge of fiscal policy direct their central bank to help the m finance it by printing money, a nd maintaining price stability and low and stable inflation is very much aided by having central bank independence.  Now, that said, in unusual times wher e the concern is with very weak growth or possibly deflation \u2014rather rare circumstances \u2014first of all, fiscal policy can be a very important tool.  And it\u2019s natural t hat if it can be employed that, just as  mone tary policy is doing a lot to try to    stimulate g rowth, that fiscal policy should play a role.  And normally, you would hope , in an economy with those severe downside risks, monetary and fiscal policy would not be working at cross purposes to get \u2014but together.  Now, whether or not in such extreme circumst ances, there might be a case for, let \u2019s say, coordination\u2014close coordination, with  the central bank playing a role in financing fiscal policy ; this is something that academics are debating, and it is something that one might legitimately consider.  I would see this as a very abnormal , extreme situation where one  needs an all -out attempt, and even then it \u2019s a matter that academics are debating, bu t only in an unusual situation\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Justin e Underhill, Y ahoo Finance.  So now that the Fed has  started the pro cess of raising rates, various F ed officials have said, including Ben Bernanke , that the F ed could go cash flow negative in this scenario as capital losses are taken on the portfolio of bonds.  Do you still see this happening , and when might this happen?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So you\u2019 re talking about our income going negative?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Yes.\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, it is c onceivable in a scenario when\u2014where growth and inflation really surprise us to the upside that we would have  to raise short -term interest rates so rapidly that the rates we would be paying on reserves would exceed what we \u2019re earning on our portfolio.  Now even then, we have about $2 trillion of liabilities, namely currency on which we pay no interest.  So this does requires an extreme scenario wit h very rapid increases in short -term interest rates.  So it is conceivable but quite unlikely that it could happen.  But, you know, if it were to happen, we would have an economy that would be doing very well.  This is pr obably an economy that ev erybody would feel very pleased\u2014was performing  well and better than expected, and where monetary policy \u2014you know, our goal is    price stability and maximum employment, and we would probably feel that we had done very well in achievin g that.  So, we usually make money \u2014we\u2019ve been making a lot of money in recent years , but the goal of monetary policy is not to maximize our income.  And, you know, in a very strong economy like that, the Treasury  would be seeing a lot of inflows in the for m of tax revenues , too.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Madam Chair, Steve Beckner of Market News International.  To what extent do you feel constrained in raising interest rates by the low  or even negative rates that foreign  central banks are pursuing , possibly out of concern for what it might mean for the dollar exchange rate?  And , if that is a constraint, to what extent are you\u2014might you also be concerned about the impact , long range , of low domestic rates on possibly distorting domestic markets?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: So the  state of foreign economies, both their growth outlooks and the stance of monetary policy, t hose are factors that influence the U .S. outlook and influence  the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  So, of course, we do look at forei gn rates, the prospects \u2014and the prospects for growth in those economies in considering the stance of policy.  Differentials between countries in  likely policy paths do tend to spill  over into exchange rates \u2014that is a standard part of how monetary policy wor ks\u2014and a stronger dolla r, those have a both\u2014a depressing effect.  It creates channels through which domestic demand is depressed.  At the moment, net exports \u2014well, for quite some  time and probably going forward, they will be somewhat of a drag on U .S. growth, s o that \u2019s a factor that we take into account.  And increases in the dollar that we \u2019ve seen since mid -2014 have served to push inflation down as well ; it can also have impacts on commodity prices that are relevant.  So, it \u2019s\u2014it is certainly relevant to the stance of U .S. monet ary policy and a factor , but when one say s \u201ca constraint ,\u201d I really would not go so far as to say  it is a constraint on monetary    policy.  When we have an outlook for continuing above -trend  growth \u2014that if we held rates absolutely flat, we have reason to bel ieve inflat ion would overshoot our target \u2014we would see a case to gradually raise rates over time.  At the moment, I think markets do expect, a nd this is factored into market prices, a gradual path for r ates to increase over time.  But, for example, if we were to see upside surprises to growth and to i nflation and had to raise short -term r ates faster, thought we should, one of the channels by which that would work would be the a ssociated impact on the dollar.  T hat is a standard channel through which the monetary poli cy transmission mechanism works, and we would take it into account and would not feel constrained , but that would be part of how it would work\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  How much do you\u2014oh, Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.  How much are you  watching oil pr ices and their impact on inflation , and how that could affect the timing of future rate increases and how much you might increase rates?\n\nCHAIR YELLEN: Well, oil prices have had many di fferent effects on the economy, and so we \u2019ve been watch ing oil prices closely.  As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation .  You know, it takes falling oil prices to lower inflation on a sustained basis.  Once they stabilize at whatever level, their impact on inflation dissipates over time.   So we \u2019re beginning to see that happening.  N ot only have they stabilized, they have moved up some, and their inflation is \u2014their impact on inflation is w aning over time.  But oil prices have also had a very substantial negative effect on drilling and mining activity  that\u2019s led to weakness in investment spending and job loss in manufacturing and, obviously, in the energy sector. Now, you know, it has different effects in different countries and different sectors.  For American households, i t\u2019s been a boon.  W e\u2019ve esti mated that since mid -2014, the decline in energy prices and oil prices has probably resulted in gains of about $1,400 per U .S. household,    and that \u2019s had an offsetting positive impact on spending.  But in many countries around the world that are important commodity exporters, the decline we \u2019ve seen in oil prices has had a depressing effect on their growth, their trade w ith us and other trade partners, and caused problems that have had spillovers to the global economy as well.

While recent economic indicators have been mixed, the Committee remains cautious in adjusting monetary policy and will adapt accordingly if the economic outlook changes.The drop in oil prices has greatly impacted the energy sector, but the unexpected slowdown in other areas of the economy, particularly business investment and household spending, has raised concerns. Despite this, there is hope for a rebound in household spending in the second quarter, which supports the expectation of moderate economic expansion. Additionally, while the job market initially showed improvement, the pace of progress has recently slowed.Job gains in April and May were lower than expected, with an average of only 80,000 per month, and the decline in the unemployment rate was due to fewer people actively seeking work. However, there was a slight increase in average hourly earnings, indicating potential wage growth, and while recent labor market data has been disappointing, it's important not to overreact to one or two monthly readings. The Committee expects the labor market to strengthen further in the next few years, but will continue to monitor the job market carefully. Ongoing economic growth and an improving labor market support the inflation outlook, although consumer price inflation is still below the 2 percent objective, largely due to previous declines in energy prices and lower import prices.Core inflation, excluding energy and food prices, has been around 1.5 percent, but the Committee expects it to rise to 2 percent over the next two to three years as transitory influences fade and the labor market strengthens. The stability of longer-run inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted, as financial market measures of inflation compensation have declined, although these indicators may not accurately reflect changes in inflation expectations relevant for wages and prices.The FOMC projects that economic growth will remain at 2 percent through 2018, with a slight decrease in the unemployment rate. The Committee will proceed cautiously in setting monetary policy due to mixed readings on the labor market and economic growth, as well as below-target inflation and vulnerabilities in the global economy.The FOMC will continue to closely monitor global economic and financial developments and expects only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, as headwinds weighing on the economy are anticipated to persist for some time. However, if these headwinds gradually fade as expected, the interest rate required to keep the economy operating smoothly should also increase.The FOMC states that policy is not predetermined and will change based on economic outlook and associated risks. They will continue reinvesting proceeds from maturing securities to maintain accommodative financial conditions and reduce the risk of lowering the federal funds rate to zero.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': How much of a factor was the upcoming Brexit vote in today's decision and what potential impact could it have on the US economy?\n'ANSWER': Brexit was discussed and considered in today's decision. It is an important decision for the UK and Europe, and could have consequences for global financial markets and the US economic outlook. It is one of the uncertainties that factored into today's decision.", "'QUESTION': What has caused the FOMC to lower its outlook for rates in 2018 and what is the Committee's view on the relationship between GDP and rates?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC's outlook for rates has been gradually decreasing, with a full percentage point decrease compared to a year ago. The Committee's view on the relationship between GDP and rates is uncertain, but the neutral rate (consistent with trend growth and full employment) is historically low due to factors such as slow productivity growth and aging societies. The neutral rate is expected to increase somewhat, but it remains uncertain.", "QUESTION: Can you comment on what it would take for two rate increases to be the likely or appropriate policy path and about the disconnect between the median view and the view of the voting members of the Committee?\n\nANSWER: The Committee does not discuss how many rate increases should be made in a year or next year. They make decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis and provide a sense of what they are looking for and the basis of their decisions. Factors such as international uncertainties, economic growth, progress in the labor market, and inflation are considered in making rate decisions. Every meeting is live and a decision to adjust the funds rate could be made at any meeting.", "QUESTION: Could the Fed's decision to raise rates in December have caused the recent slowdown in the labor market?\n\nANSWER: The labor market conditions index is an experimental research product that assesses changes in the labor market. While there has been a loss of momentum in job growth, other indicators such as low unemployment claims and high job openings suggest continued progress. The Fed does not have a fixed plan for raising rates and will adjust their thinking based on incoming data.", "'QUESTION': How do you explain the low level of long-term bond yields and does it affect your projections?\n'ANSWER': The low level of long-term bond yields is influenced by market expectations of short-term rates over the next 10 years and the term premium. Both factors are currently low, with market expectations for short-term rates remaining low and the term premium likely decreasing. Central banks like the ECB and Bank of Japan are also engaging in quantitative easing, further pushing down term premia.", "'QUESTION': Do these yield levels give you any uncertainty, any doubt about whether you will be able to get rates to where projections say they're going?\n'ANSWER': We are uncertain about where rates are heading in the longer term. The longer-run normal level of the federal funds rate is uncertain, and the so-called neutral rate is currently low. While it is reasonable to assume rates will move up over time, we are not certain. Recent revisions have mainly been in the downward direction, indicating a low neutral rate may be closer to the new normal.", "'QUESTION': What indicators does the Federal Reserve need to see to be convinced that the labor market is still moving towards full employment, and for how long would they need to see it?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve does not have a specific formula or cutoff number, but they will be looking at various indicators such as the next job report, revisions to previous months, surveys of employment intentions, and other labor market indicators to determine if there is an adequate pace of job creation.", "'QUESTION': Did you intentionally leave out the possibility of a rate hike in the coming months in your speech in Philadelphia?\n'ANSWER': We need to ensure there is sufficient momentum and cannot specify a timetable. Every meeting is open for a possible rate increase. While I can't say it will happen in the next meeting or two, it is not impossible that by July, data could show we are on the right track.", "'QUESTION': Will the upcoming election influence the Fed's decision to change policy?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is focused on assessing the economic outlook and making appropriate changes without considering politics. If the data justifies gradual increases, the market should not be surprised by such a decision. The Committee will feel free to move in the coming months if they deem it appropriate.", "'QUESTION': Are you more concerned with inflation expectations or the slight pickup in actual inflation?\n'ANSWER': We are looking at both. Inflation is behaving as expected, with past declines in energy prices and increases in the value of the dollar being the main reasons for low inflation. As these factors dissipate, we expect inflation to move up. Core inflation is also behaving as expected, influenced by the dollar and import prices. We monitor indicators of inflation expectations, but it is hard to know which expectations are relevant to actual price and wage decisions.", "'QUESTION': Was it a conscious decision to hold back information about the June rate increase discussion until the release of the April minutes?\n'ANSWER': The minutes are always an accurate reflection of what happened at the meeting and are not changed afterwards. There was a good deal of discussion about a possible June rate increase at the April meeting, but the April statement did not provide an obvious hint. However, there were hints in the statement that the Committee was changing its views. The June minutes accurately summarized the April meeting.", "'QUESTION': Do you think that increasing the federal minimum wage could be of any help in boosting higher wages and driving up inflation?\n'ANSWER': The increase in the federal minimum wage has a relatively minor influence on wage inflation. Faster wage increases would indicate a diminishing labor market slack and approaching conditions of maximum employment. The recent hints of wage growth are a sign of a healthy labor market, which aligns with our objective of achieving maximum employment.", "'QUESTION': Should central banks consider using helicopter money in extreme circumstances?\n'ANSWER': In normal times, it is important to separate monetary and fiscal policy to maintain central bank independence. However, in rare circumstances of weak growth or deflation, fiscal policy can be important and coordination with the central bank in financing fiscal policy may be considered. This would only be in extreme situations and is currently a topic of debate among academics.", "'QUESTION': Do you still see the Fed going cash flow negative as capital losses are taken on the portfolio of bonds?\n'ANSWER': So you're talking about our income going negative?", "'QUESTION': Is it possible for short-term interest rates to increase so rapidly that the rates paid on reserves exceed the earnings on the portfolio?\n\n'ANSWER': It is conceivable but unlikely. This would require a scenario with very rapid increases in short-term interest rates. However, if it were to happen, it would indicate a strong economy performing well, and the goal of monetary policy is not to maximize income but to achieve price stability and maximum employment.", "'QUESTION': To what extent do you feel constrained in raising interest rates by the low or even negative rates that foreign central banks are pursuing, possibly out of concern for what it might mean for the dollar exchange rate?

Exchange rates and a stronger dollar can have a depressing effect on domestic demand and push inflation down. While it is a factor, it is not a constraint on monetary policy.", "'QUESTION': How much are you watching oil prices and their impact on inflation, and how that could affect the timing of future rate increases and how much you might increase rates?\n'ANSWER': Oil prices have various effects on the economy, including pulling down inflation. Falling oil prices are needed to lower inflation on a sustained basis, and once they stabilize, their impact on inflation diminishes over time. While oil prices have stabilized and even increased, they have negatively affected drilling, mining, investment spending, and job loss in certain sectors. However, for American households, falling oil prices have been beneficial, resulting in estimated gains of $1,400 per household since mid-2014. In contrast, many commodity-exporting countries have experienced a decline in growth and trade due to the drop in oil prices, causing spillovers to the global economy. Overall, the impact of oil prices is complex."]}
