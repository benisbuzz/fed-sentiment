Sorry about that.  So I was struck by the , sort of , disconnect that exists here between the behavior of unemployment and inflation.  Y ou seem to have unemployment penciled in here now for three  years run ning\u2014more \u2014underneath the longer -run level, yet inflation never really accelerates.  S o what are we to make of that\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well , that \u2019s\u2014what \u2019s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization , or unemployment , and infl ation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years.  If you go back 50 years , you would have seen that, when there was \u2014when labor markets were tight and unemployment was low, inflation moved right up.  And then as the Fed got control of inflation, the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker, to the point where there \u2019s still a connection, but it\u2019s \u2014it\u2019 s a very faint one.  And I \u2014what that suggests is that you                                                  1 Chair Powell intended to say the repurchase operations were announced in October.    would need to keep policy somewhat accommodative .  And we believe that policy is somewhat accommodative , and we think that that \u2019s the appropriate place for policy to be in order to drive up inflation.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could f ollow up on that \u2014I mean , it\u2019s faint to nonexistent , though, it seems to me, so this  suggest s that, really , your policy leve r as it exists now isn \u2019t really influencing prices at all.  So , in that case, what do you do to reach your target?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, I don\u2019 t think that\u2019 s right .  I mean, we \u2014the \u2014again , the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak , has been weak.  The coefficient is something like 0.1.  So it \u2019s much, much lower than it used to be , but I don\u2019 t know that it \u2019s gone down any more in the last decade .  It just is quite faint.  But it\u2019 s still there .  I mean , you can see it .  If you look\u2014look at where wages were three  or four  years ago, they were running around 2 percent.  And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up to 3 and 3\u00bd percent , and that suggests tightening.  The same thing is true , but much less true , of inflation, the relationship between \u2014in a way , the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient than the price Phillips curve does.  But we do still see some relationship , and that \u2019s what you\u2019 re seeing in those numbers\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman CNBC.  You\u2019 ve used the analogy t o 1998 to describe the rate cuts we just went through, and I \u2019m wondering if we can sort of continue the analogy.  Within seven  months of those \u2019 98 rate cuts, t he Fed took them back and then som e.  So, were these those kind of rate cuts, the kind that you need to take back, or are we at a place now where we \u2019re at a neutral rate \u2014\u201ctake back ,\u201d I mean if those risks that you say we \u2019re cushioning from don\u2019 t materialize in the way you think\u2014or is this now a new sort of steady state   for the economy at this rate, this is the right rate for the economy that you see going forward and don\u2019t need to take those rate cuts back\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So there \u2019s similarities, conceptual similarities , I think , between th e two instances during that long expansion, I guess in \u201995 and \u2019 98, when the Fed cut three times only to resume raising rates.  And the notion just is that it \u2019s a\u2014the economy needed slightly more accommodative policy , but it wasn \u2019t the end of the expansion, right?  And that \u2019s the same situation we believe we \u2019re in here.  So this is that we did, in fact , turn out to do three rate cuts .  That wasn \u2019t in the plan, you know , in any kind of specific way at the beginning.  So that \u2019s the same.  What \u2019s diffe rent is , you have a very different \u2014you have very different structural characteristics in the economy , particularly around inflation.  So now, as you can see , inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50- year lows and expected t o remain there.  So the need for rate increases is less.  And , by the way, this is \u2014it\u2019s a good thing that , you know, we think we can \u2014I think we \u2019ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upwa rd pressure on inflation.  In fact, we need some upward pressure o n inflation to get back to 2 percent.  It \u2019s quite different in \u2019 95 and \u2019 98 when there were those two adjustments.  S o, I would say, similarities and differences.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: The BIS  conc luded in\u2014 I did the same thing as Howard.  Michael McKee, Bloomberg radio and television.  The BIS concluded in September that the repo spike was not a one -off confluence of random events but reflected structural and regulatory issues that could lead to a r ecurrence.  I \u2019d like to ask you if you agree with the BIS findings . And, given that we \u2019re approaching year -end for the markets , will you be taking any extra steps to ensure that funding is available in the repo and FX swaps markets?   There was a report   yesterday  from  Credit Suisse suggesting there \u2019s a good chance that we will see disruptions , and one of the reasons they put for it is that the Fed is at this point buying only T -bills, and the market wants to sell coupons .  Do you have any plans to sell coupons?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So I \u2019m going to take a little step back, and I will\u2014 I will get to your specific questions on the year -end and on T -bills.  So I guess I want to start by stressing that these are very important operational matters but that are not like ly to have any macroeconomic implications.  We \u2019d decided back in January to remain an ample -reserves regime, and that means we will be setting the federal funds rate \u2014the range for the federal funds rate through our administered rates and not through active  management of the level of reserves.  We \u2019re committed to robustly implementing that framework , as you can see by our actions.  And the purpose of all this, let \u2019s remember, is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be transmitted to the federal funds rate, which in turn affects other short -term rates.  We have the tools to accomplish that , and we will use them.  The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all volatility , particularly in the repo market.  So, taking you back, this \u2014as you know , we h ad very gradually allowed the balance sheet to shrink, we slowed that gradual pace by half in March, and then we ended it in July.  Meanwhile, we had surveyed all of the banks, and particularly the large banks who hold a lot of the reserves,  and said , \u201cWha t\u2019s your lowest comfortable level of reserves? \u201d  We got those numbers, we added them up, we added a buffer , and it came out sort of at a level that was well below where we were in September.  And yet we saw , actually , in September that reserves \u2014the markets acted as though reserves had become scarce.  So what had happened was that liquidity , which actually existed , didn \u2019t flow into the repo market , and that had effects on the federal funds rate.  So the question is, why did that happen?    And we \u2019ve been very carefully looking at the reasons why that might have happened.  T here are\u2014there are  payments issues, there have been a number of supervisory and regulatory issues raised \u2014we \u2019re looking carefully at those.  We \u2019re open to ideas for modifying supervisory and regulatory practice in ways that don \u2019t undermine safety and soundness , and a number of ideas are under \u2014under  examination there.  To go through it sort of by\u2014in time, we started off , really , on September  17 with overnight operations .  By October 11 we had cr eated and put into effect a plan.  T hat plan is in effect.  It \u2019s working.  I think , for the last couple of months, repo markets have been functioning well, short -term rates are stable, markets are functioning.  So you asked about year -end.  T emporary upward pressures  on short -term money market rates are not unusual around year -end.  And our \u2014both our repo operations and Treasury bill purchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal funds rate.  We think that the pressures appear manageable, and we stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.  Our strategy has been \u2014essentially , the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term through\u2014through both overnight and term repo, a nd, at the same time, we \u2019re raising the underlying level of reserves through bill purchases.  I \u2019ll take that now.  We\u2019ve said bills \u2014bill purchases.  We\u2019ve also said that we were willing to ad apt our strategy.  We \u2019re not at this place , but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short -term coupon securities, then we would be prepared to do that if \u2014if the need arises.  So \u2014but we don\u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t \u2014we \u2019re not in that place .  It looks \u2014it very much looks li ke the bill \u2014so those bill purchases are going well , just according to expectations.  I mean, the other thing I \u2019ll say is that we \u2019re in, you know, very regular contact with market participants all the time.  We \u2019ll be   providing\u2014 we\u2019ll be continuing that , and we \u2019re prepared to adjust our tactics.

I think the standing repo facility is something that\u2019ll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place.  At the moment what we \u2019re focused on is, you know \u2014we \u2019re now focused on year -end.

And in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that\u2019 s persistent and that \u2019s significant \u2014a significant move -up in inflation that \u2019s also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns.

Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.   Just following up on Heather \u2019s question \u2014so if you look at the SEP today, it looks l ike inflation is never overshooting 2 percent and is only getting up to 2 percent by the end of 2021, yet rates are increasing in 2021.  So, I guess , how do we square that circle , with interest rates increasing before inflation ever really moves up in some meaningful overshooting way?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I think what you\u2019 re seeing is, you\u2019 ve got a full year of the median being flat , which is , we think, accommodative, modestly accommodat ive, and inflation not moving up very much, as we\u2019 ve discussed.  And that underscores , I think , the challenge of getting inflation to move up.  The C ommittee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent, squarely at 2 percent , for\u2014ever since I arrived in 2012.  And it hasn \u2019t happened, and it \u2019s just \u2014it\u2019s because there are disinflationary forces around the world , and they\u2019 ve been stronger than, I think , people understood them to be.  In terms of those out -year rate increases, what \u2019s you\u2019 re\u2014you \u2019re looking at rate in creases more than a year into the future , and, you know, people will have their own explanations for why they do that, but we \u2014really, none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like in 2021.  So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that , over time , it would be appropriate \u2014if you believe that the neutral rate is 2\u00bd percent , it would be appropriate for your rates to move up in that direction.  I will also say to you that a number of people wrote down, and you can\u2019 t see this at this level of detail,  but\u2014today \u2014but a number of people did write down overshoots of inflation as appropriate \u2014under appropriate policy.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Brendan Greeley from the Financial Times.  Given that inflation \u2014whichever measure you choose \u2014ha s either sort of remain ed where it is or not increased over the past year as you \u2019ve been dropping the policy rate , what is it that gives you confidence that the Fed has the tools to get inflation back up to target or even overshoot as you just indicated th at some people are considering doing?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, it \u2019s just that there is still, empirically , by many, many different \u2014by the work of many different analysts , there is a relationship between resource utilization , by which I mean unemployment , and i nflation .  It\u2019s just relatively weak.  And, by the way, that \u2019s not a bad thing.  T hat means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good\u2014in some dimensions \u2014labor market without having to worry about inflation.  It also means, though, that it\u2019 s not easy to move inflation up.  Now, you say, why is there confidence?  I mean, I would say there \u2019s more humility than there is confidence in this at this point.  It \u2019s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target.  If you look ar ound the world, the United States, of all major economies, has been closest to it but still hasn \u2019t quite been able to achieve it.  And I would also point out that this year , which has been a good year for the economy, inflation \u2014core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent, whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year.  So it\u2019s \u2014it\u2019s a real challenge, and\u2014 but I think we \u2019re using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Nick Timiraos , the Wall Street Journal.   So, Chair Powell, I want to ask about the framework review , which obviously entails some kind of debate around allowing an overshoot of the 2 percent target.  And in that \u2014in that context , is merely saying that you want inflation to rise above 2 percent a  sufficient strategy for getting inflation to stay at the target, or would it compel some kind of policy action beyond deferring future rate increases to achieve that   outcome if that \u2019s the direction in which the C ommittee goes ?  In other words , it\u2019s one thing to accept inflation rising on its own opportunistically.  B ut if inflation does not materialize , would a change in the framework necessarily make it easier to generate higher inflation\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, I \u2014you know, I think the answer to the questio n of whether saying it is enough to create credibility, the answer  to that is \u201c no.\u201d  And I think you have to back that up with policy that supports the outcome , and that \u2019s what we \u2019re trying to do.  And so the \u2014the changes that we \u2019re looking at to the framew ork are \u2014I think they take all of that on board, and\u2014but they\u2019 re\u2014what they\u2019 re\u2014what they are  designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of that\u2014of that  inflation target, but only if followed by policy.  Ultimately, it will take time to establish \u2014to move  inflation expectations up from where they are , which appears to be a bit below 2 percent , will not happen overnight .  It\u2019ll have to happen over time as credibility is built.

Chair Powell, the Fed policy review this year has largely been discussed in terms of the infla tion side of the mandate and the need to shore up inflation expectations.  But it seems like the message you \u2019ve been getting from the Fed Listens  events and also something else you\u2019 ve recently acknowledged is that, you know, the Fed has also been systematically overestimating labor utilization throughout this expansion.  So I \u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the extent to which the review is looking at the employment side of the mandate as well.  Are there any possibilities, you   know, for perhaps systematizing a more asymmetric reaction function with regard to unemployment?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes.

It\u2019s just been \u2014it\u2019 s in estimates not just at the Fed , but among \u2014broadly among economists \u2014labor economists have seen that the connection \u2014that we can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought .  And, as I  mentioned, that\u2019s a good thing because that means we\u2014we  don\u2019 t have to worry so much about inflation.  And that \u2019s\u2014and you see the benefits of that in today \u2019s labor market.  I\u2014you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they are about maximum employment.  If you\u2019ve \u2014if you\u2019ve  listen ed to or attended any of those, the discussion \u2014we always focus on inflation as well , but the discussion is really around what \u2019s happening in low - and moderate -income communities and among small businesses.  And I think you\u2014you get a perspective , which \u2014you know, we were already getting that from our extensive outreach to community groups and such.  But it was help to get \u2014helpful to get it in  the context of a monetary policy review.  And I think that the fact that these communities have so much\u2014such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there.  And I think that does also infor m our understanding of what we mean by \u201cmaximum employment .\u201d And it\u2019s been a very positive \u2014I would say that the Fed Listens  events have been \u2014have been  extraordinarily positive , and they\u2019 re certainly something w e\u2019ll repeat.  You also see from   the business p erspective that companies are taking all kinds of measures to \u2014you know, to look through things on people \u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that would have perhaps disqualified them in other kinds of environments, training is moving up\u2014you hear just a lot \u2014there are a lot of things  going on that suggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances, which is a great thing.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: T hanks.  Sorry, if I could just follow up briefly \u2014is there any way to sort of systematize these insights , do you think, with, you know, in terms of \u2014we talk a lot about , for example , makeup strategies on the inflation side .  Is there anything similar you could do on the employment side?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, I \u2014I think we have kind of internalized \u2014and this isn\u2019 t\u2014this isn\u2019t news for today, this is something we \u2019ve been saying for, you know, for several years \u2014you\u2019ve seen us moving down our estimates of the \u2014of maximum employment.  In fact , it\u2019s already \u2014it\u2019s already understood, I think, that \u2014that  there \u2019s more \u2014even though we \u2019re at 3\u00bd percent unemployment , there \u2019s actually more slack out there, in a sense.  A nd\u2014and the risks of, you know, using accommodative monetary policy, our tool , to explore that are relatively low.

I wanted to ask more about the \u2014the repo issues and what you all are doing beyond open market operations.  Ar e you currently, for example , telling examiners not to prefer reserves over Treasuries for supervisory purposes?   Are you talking to the Treasury Department about maybe reducing the level of volatility in their account at the Fed?  And on the standing repo facility , is it, you know, that you would be   inclined to do it , but you need to figure out the details ?  Or\u2014or what would kind of drive the decision on whether or not to do that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we \u2019ve done a ton of work on that.  We\u2019ve talked to supervisors , and\u2014it \u2019s interesting, if you look at the banks, they\u2019 re all over the place on the composition of their \u2014of their  buffer.  So you have to have \u2014you have a business model , and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be , and that suggests what your buffer should be.  And you see them making quite different choices.  Some of them have lots of reserves and, you know, fewer T reasuries, and then they change their mind and they switch, so i t\u2019s not obvious that  there \u2019s one thing happening there.  Notwithstanding that, we have \u2014we\u2019ve gone out to try to understand that , talking to supervisors.  In terms of the \u2014the  TGA, you know, we have not tried to pull the TGA into this yet ; we\u2019ve taken it as exogenous.  I don\u2019 t know that at some point we won\u2019 t have those discussions , but, you know, Treasury \u2014we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs.  And then we should\u2014we are essentially taking that as exogenous to our \u2014to our  work .  And, you know, there may come a time when we \u2014when we  talk about that, but we haven\u2019 t done much of that.  Standing repo facility\u2014so your question on that is, what are we thinking about it?  What are we\u2014I mean, I \u2014so I think we\u2019re \u2014we are more focused , frankly, on the T \u2014the bill purchases, t he year -end, and also the review of supervisory and regulatory issues that we \u2019re digging into, and\u2014because we think, you know, there \u2019s\u2014these are structural things \u2014right? \u2014where you could, without sacrificing safety and soundness, just allow the \u2014allow the  liquidity that is already there to flow more freely , perhaps by making fairly straightforward, noncontroversial changes .  And we think there is some of that , though\u2014a nd so we \u2019re working hard and fast.  But those are things, you know, the \u2014if they take rule changes, it \u2019ll take, you   know, a notice of public rulemaking\u2014i t\u2019ll take three  months and things like that.  Those things take time.   These things that we\u2019 re working on now , though\u2014like, you know, going through year-end with the overnight facilities and the  bill purchases and the term repo\u2014those are \u2014those are things we have to do right now and are doing.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chris Rugaber  at Associated Press.   I wanted to ask, the only change in the statement was a drop in the reference to uncertainties around the economy.  You seem very confident that \u2014or it implies there \u2019s a lot of confidence that those uncertainties have gone away.  What caused you to make that change for the  statement?  What were you looking at that  seemed to be so much lower \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, we did , actually \u2014if you look at the statement, you\u2019 ll notice that we \u2014we  did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the statement.  And why did  we do that?  You know, those are the things that we \u2019ve been monitoring all year.   We \u2019ve put now in place policies that we think are appropriate to address those things , so we \u2019re not revisiting that.   But those are \u2014those are  just key things , and they haven\u2019 t gone away , so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there \u2014still subject to the idea that, for us to change our stance, we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Well, just to follow real qu ick, on the material\u2014material  reassessment aspect, are you worried that that has set too high a bar for potential cuts next year?  We were talking about rate hikes, but no\u2014no Fed policymaker seems to foresee any cuts next year.  Some economist s do.  Does a  material reassessment mean you need to see data actually worsen?  Does it reduce your ability to act preemptively the way , arguably, you did this year?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So,  I mean,  one thing that we \u2019re mindful of is that we \u2019ve cut rates three times since Ju ly.  That \u2019s 75 basis points \u2019 worth of cuts.  And we do believe that monetary   policy operates with long and variable lags , and that it will take some time before the full effects of those actions are seen in the economy.  So that \u2019ll take some time.   So that \u2019s one reason to hold back and\u2014and  wait.  And we thought \u2014I think we took strong measures.  In fact, if you look at\u2014more broadly at the Treasury yield curve, it has moved more than 75 basis points.  So you\u2019ve\u2014you\u2019ve  had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation. In terms of what \u2019s\u2014you know, what is material at the end of the day, w ell, I would just say, whether or not a change in the outlook merits a policy response will be a collective judgme nt of the FOMC.  There isn \u2019t any single factor that will determine our decisions.  We\u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll look at a full range of data and other information bearing on the economic outlook\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you Mr. Chairman, Scott Horsley for NPR.  You started out by talking about Paul Volcker , who obviously cast a \u2014a long shadow.  I wonder if , in hindsight , that shadow was\u2014was  too long, and if \u2014in the decades since his tenure and , in particular, last year, if the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates to attack  an inflation bogeyman that didn \u2019t materialize.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I \u2014this wouldn\u2019 t be a \u2014my response will not be about Paul Volcker , but\u2014so, well, you started with Paul Volcker.  So, if you look back at 2018 \u2014I\u2019ll just take you back to the beginning of 2018.  We had an economy growing at 3 percent , we had inflation at 2 percent, and we had a trillion and a half dollars \u2019 worth of stimulus arriving, a nd the federal funds rate was 1.4 percent.  So it wasn \u2019t that \u2014so we moved\u2014we moved policy up during the course of  the year.  We never got policy even at the level of what we thought the neutral rate was at th e time.  So there was no sense of it being restrictive.  We took steps to make it less accommodative, and that seemed to be the right thing.  It still seems to m e to be the right thing in hindsight.  The idea that we were trying to, you know, slow the economy down\u2014w e   were really just trying to get near neutral.  A nd even with the last rate increase a year ago, we were still meaningfully below the median estimate o n the Com mittee of what the neutral rate was.  So policy was always accommodative during the course of that year.  I think what \u2019s happened is , the\u2014obviously, the facts on the ground have change d.  You saw the global economic slowdown begin in the middle of last year, gather force, and then continue to go on this year, so you\u2019 ve seen a continual weakening.  Just look at the IM F\u2019s forecast s of growth from, you know, the spring of 2018 and compare them to now.  You\u2019ve had quite a significant \u2014that does affect us.  I think , also, the trade situation was just beginning in the middle of \u2019 18, and I think it had \u2014has had\u2014you know, I think the re\u2019ll be a very, very wide range of estimates of the effect , but I think it \u2019s had a meaningful effect on output just through the uncertainty channel and,  to a lesser extent , through\u2014through, you know, the tariff effects.  And , again, that \u2019s not to make a judgment.  It\u2019 s not up to us to make a judgment about that.  So, that \u2019s what \u2014that would be my  story.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Chair Powell, D onna Borak with CNN.  To follow  up on Edward\u2019 s trade question , could you talk about what you would imagine the economic effect would be if negotiations with China were to fall apart and how the Fed might be able to support the economy in that event?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, I wouldn\u2019 t want to speculate on \u2014on a hypothetical .  I would say\u2014we\u2019ll just have to see.  W e\u2019re\u2014we look at a range of factors and we \u2019ve\u2014as I \u2019ve said before, we try to look through the volatility in trade news  and trade negotiations.  We t ry not to react.

Does the Fed \u2019s dot plot still serve a useful communications purpose , or do you feel that it might be time to retire  it or change it in some fashion?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: With \u2014I think properly understood, it can be useful , but that \u2019s been a challenge.  You know, I think \u201c properly understood\u201d  to me means looking at what it is and not at what it isn \u2019t.  And what it is  is, it\u2019s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy.  Remember tha t we write all that down , and we send it in , and it gets compiled.  But we don\u2019 t discuss it at the meeting , and we don\u2019 t negotiate a plan.  There is no\u2014t here\u2019s no agreement.  There \u2019s no plan.    And I think, particularly at inflection points, it\u2019 s hard to convey the reality , which is that policy is always going to depend on the economic outlook and changes in the economic outlook.  And when the economic outlook is changing, the dots are \u2014they\u2019re just not a consideration.  We\u2019re going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy.  And if the fact \u2014dots that we did six  months ago or three  months ago don\u2019 t agree with that, that \u2019s not even in the conversation.  So its more \u2014but it can it be useful if \u2014and I think\u2014but , as I said, it \u2019s been a challenge , and so I \u2014I do\u2014I do like to say , if you focus too much on the dots, you can\u2014you can miss the broader picture.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chairman Powell, many people seem worried that the framework that you guys are working on is going to be \u2014the results are going to be less rather than more.  And I \u2014people keep coming back and saying why\u2014asking why you took off , like , a 4 percent inflation rate off the table even when it started.  I mean, as you said , going around the country for all the Listen  events, I don\u2019 t think I heard anybody worry about a 4 percent inflation rate or think that a higher inflation rate was going to be a problem.  So where does that concern come from?  Is it members of Congress that have\u2014have  said this?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: No.  S o let me say , we\u2019re\u2014we\u2019ve been working on this all year.  And we \u2019re just at the stage where we\u2019 ve had a really interesting discussion about the various tools that we have at the October meeting.  At this meeting, we talked about the way monetary policy affects different groups in the economy.  So we had a \u2014we talked about the Fed Listens  events and some very interesting research.  So we \u2019re just getting to the stage where we \u2019re looking at conclusions .  You know , what do we take away from all this?  And those things \u2014many of those things would wind up as changes , if you will, modifications to the \u201cStatement of Longer -Run G oals and Monetary P olicy S trategy. \u201d  I think that process will take until the midd le   of the year where \u2014but we want to approach it very thoroughly and very carefully.  And that is \u2014in effect, that is our framework document.  And I wouldn\u2019 t prejudge.  No one \u2014I believe we will be able to \u2014to reach a successful conclusion and make meaningful improvements.  I do. In terms of \u201c 4 percent \u201d\u2014so that \u2019s\u2014I think it \u2019s premature for people to be saying that this isn\u2019t going anywhere.  You know \u2014and if you define going anywhere as a 4 percent inflation target\u2014let me talk about the 4 percent inflation targe t.  So I \u2019ll go back to the point that just saying words is not itself credible.   So I think if you said, \u201cW e\u2019re raising the inflation target to 4,\u201d what would be the effect of that?  I mean, where\u2019 s the credibility in that, really?  You haven\u2019 t been able to get it to 2.  So I think we \u2014I think you need to lower your sights a little bit.  I also think, is 4 percent \u2014you \u2019d have to ask the question, is that really, you know, price stability?  Is that really price stability?  Is that within our legal mandate?  I mean , I think it\u2019 s a fair question.  So, you know, I think\u2014 I\u2019d like for this review to come out with very\u2014 a set of positive results\u2014you know, meaningful improvements.  It doesn\u2019 t mean it has to solve every problem going forward.  We want to \u2014we want to  have this be a successful exercise where we meaningfully improve our monetary policy framework.  These things don \u2019t tend to move in \u2014you know, in a lurchy way, t hey tend to evolve.  But I think \u2014and if we do this , then in a few years, again and again  and things like that , then we can \u2014at least we\u2019 re moving in a good direction.  And I think we will be.

I\u2019m Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.  Chair Powell, wh y aren \u2019t we seeing stronger wage gains?   Wages are growing more slowly now than they were toward the beginning of the year.  Why is that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, wage gains have moved up a bit.  If you look back three , four  years, you\u2019 ll see wages are growing around 2 percent.  Now you see them moving up, you know, more at 3, 3\u00bd  percent.  So why aren \u2019t they growing higher, at a faster rate?  And it \u2019s a couple of things.  I think there are a range of explanations.  For instance, one would be that productivity has just been low.  So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity.  Productivity has been low , and that \u2014that is very likely to be holding back wages.  I also think there are other   possible potential explanations , such as, you know, globalization can be \u2014the idea that you can make, manufacture, or even provide services anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world.  I think that hangs over the wage -setting process\u2014 and everywhere , pretty much.  You don\u2019 t see\u2014there i sn\u2019t the kind of traction in the wage market that\u2014even in a tight labor market. Another thing is , though,  that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it was.  And, you know, I think there \u2014there are many, many possible explanations.  I will say , though, if you look, for example , at nonsupervisory employees in the labor report, there are \u2014their wages are going up at 3.7 percent.  And so, you do see \u2014and wages are going up the most for people at the lower  end of the \u2014that \u2019s been true for the last couple of years \u2014lower  end of the wage spectrum.   So you do see wages moving up.  It\u2019s  just\u2014they\u2019re not moving up at \u2014at very high rates.  And, again , at the end of the day, that probably has most to do with productivity.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Can I ask  a quick follow -up?  Just as far as the market not being as tight as you thought, are you saying there are still more people on the sidelines who could join the labor force?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, y es.  And I would also say that we \u2014if you ask people, and we did ask people, what do you think the natural rate of unemployment is?  People were writing down numbers in the fives , and then they were writing down numbers in the fours.  And now, unemployment has been in the threes for a year and a half , and we still s ee wage inflation , as you mentioned.  The level of wage inflation has actually moved down, a lthough, there may be compositional effects in that number that may\u2014that may  be, to some extent , about younger workers coming in at lower wages that \u2014than retiring w orkers . But you wouldn\u2019 t\u2014that shouldn\u2019 t have much of an effect , actually.  So why is that ?  It may just be that there \u2019s more slack in the economy.  And I think we are seeing that.  We\u2019re   seeing \u2014really , it showed up through higher participation.  For many years, we\u2019ve  thought that there \u2019s a trend decline in participation.  Notwithstanding that, against that trend , we\u2019ve seen prime -age participation moving up pretty steadily over the last two  or three  years.  And it\u2019s a very positive thing, but it does sort of provide more labor supply, meaning a less tight labor market.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi.  Hannah Lang with American Banker.

I mean, we \u2014there\u2019s so many other measures that suggest that the labor market is \u2014I like to say  the labor market is strong.  I don\u2019 t really want to say that it \u2019s tight.  Someone asked me a question about a  hot labor market \u2014that was in the Humphrey- Hawkins hearings.  S o I\u2019ll say that the labor market is strong.   I don\u2019 t know that it \u2019s tight, because you \u2019re not seeing wage increases, you know.  Ultimately , if it\u2019s tight, those should be\u2014should be  reflected in  higher wage increases, so it does come down to that.  You know, we look at countless measures of labor market \u2014you know, labor utilization, and there \u2019s so many \u2014it\u2019s too many to count.  But the one that has \u2014that is kind of suggesting that you\u2019 re\u2014it\u2019s a healthy number that, you know, the  sort of 3.1 percent average hourly earnings number is a decent number \u20143.7 percent for production and nonsupervisory workers is more healthy.  Ultimately , though, we \u2019d like to see \u2014to call it \u201c hot,\u201d  you\u2019 d want to see heat.  You \u2019d want to see, you know, higher wages.  Thanks.\n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 8, "dovish": 15, "neutral": 30}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 0, "dovish": 4, "neutral": 25}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 8, "dovish": 19, "neutral": 55}, "speech_summary": "In today's meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to keep the policy rate unchanged after previously lowering it by \u00c2\u00be percentage point in the past three meetings. Additionally, the chairman pays tribute to Paul Volcker, highlighting his accomplishments in taming inflation and his dedication to public service.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains focused on achieving maximum employment and price stability, and believes that monetary policy is well positioned to support economic growth, a strong job market, and inflation near the 2 percent goal. Despite global developments and ongoing risks, the overall economy has been growing moderately and is expected to continue growing at a moderate pace in the coming years.The job market remains strong with low unemployment rates, solid job gains, increasing labor force participation, rising wages, and broad-based employment gains across all demographics. However, inflation continues to run below the 2 percent objective.Persistently low inflation can lead to a downward spiral of inflation expectations and lower interest rates, limiting the effectiveness of future interest rate reductions to support the economy. Despite a strong economy, the Federal Reserve expects inflation to rise to 2 percent and remains committed to achieving this goal, adjusting monetary policy to cushion the economy from challenges and provide insurance against associated risks.The current shift in monetary policy has supported the economy and maintained a positive outlook. The projections for economic growth, unemployment rate, and inflation remain relatively unchanged, except for a lower inflation projection for 2019.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been conducting term repo operations to address potential pressures in money markets during the year-end period. They are prepared to make necessary adjustments to their operations in order to maintain the federal funds rate within the target range.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': What is the reason for the disconnect between unemployment and inflation?\n'ANSWER': The relationship between unemployment and inflation has weakened over the years. In the past, when labor markets were tight and unemployment was low, inflation would increase. However, as the Fed gained control of inflation, the connection became fainter. This suggests that policy needs to remain accommodative to drive up inflation.", "'QUESTION': If your current policy level isn't influencing prices, what do you do to reach your target?\n'ANSWER': The relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak, but it still exists. Wages have increased from 2% to 3-3.5% in the past few years, indicating tightening. While the relationship is weaker for inflation, there is still some correlation between wages and prices.", "QUESTION: Are the recent rate cuts similar to the ones in 1998 that needed to be taken back, or are we now at a steady state for the economy?\n\nANSWER: There are conceptual similarities between the rate cuts in 1998 and the recent ones, as both were meant to provide slightly more accommodative policy without ending the expansion. However, there are differences in the economy's structural characteristics, particularly regarding inflation. With unemployment at historic lows and inflation barely moving up, the need for rate increases is less, and it's a positive sign that low unemployment doesn't lead to unwanted inflationary pressure.", "'QUESTION': Do you agree with the BIS findings on the repo spike and will you take extra steps to ensure funding availability in the repo and FX swaps markets?\n'ANSWER': We have carefully examined the reasons behind the repo market disruption and are open to modifying supervisory and regulatory practices. We have implemented a plan that has stabilized the repo markets and short-term rates. We believe the pressures around year-end are manageable and we stand ready to adjust our operations as necessary. We may consider purchasing other short-term coupon securities if needed.", "'QUESTION': Where do you personally stand on the idea of not raising interest rates until core inflation is back at 2 percent?\n'ANSWER': I think the standing repo facility is something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take time to evaluate and create. Currently, we are focused on year-end and the gradual decline of overnight and term repo as the level of reserves increases. As for the idea of not raising interest rates until core inflation is back at 2 percent, I don't have a personal stance on that.", "'QUESTION': Where does Chair Powell stand on raising interest rates until core inflation is back at 2 percent?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell believes that the policy rate is currently appropriate and will remain so as long as incoming data align with the outlook. He would only consider raising rates if there is persistent and significant inflation, indicating a need to address inflation concerns.", "'QUESTION': Is the current policy of the Committee not officially stated?\n'ANSWER': The policy is not codified in a statement as it is not intended to be official forward guidance. The Chair's view is that raising interest rates to address inflation would require a more explicit statement.", "'QUESTION': How do we reconcile the increase in interest rates in 2021 with the fact that inflation is not expected to reach 2 percent until the end of 2021?\n'ANSWER': The challenge of getting inflation to move up to 2 percent has been due to strong disinflationary forces globally. The rate increases projected for 2021 are based on uncertain future economic conditions and the belief that it would be appropriate for rates to move towards the neutral rate of 2\u00c2\u00bd percent. Some participants also noted that overshooting inflation may be appropriate under the right policy.", "'QUESTION': Given that inflation has not increased despite dropping the policy rate, what gives you confidence that the Fed has the tools to raise inflation back to target?\n'ANSWER': There is still a weak relationship between unemployment and inflation, which allows us to run at low unemployment levels without worrying about inflation. However, it also means that it is not easy to increase inflation. We have more humility than confidence in this matter, as it has been challenging to achieve the target. We are using our tools to the best of our ability to meet this challenge.", "QUESTION: Is merely saying that you want inflation to rise above 2 percent a sufficient strategy for getting inflation to stay at the target?\n\nANSWER: No, saying it is not enough to create credibility. It needs to be backed up with policy that supports the outcome. The changes to the framework are designed to strengthen the credibility of the inflation target, but only if followed by policy. It will take time to establish higher inflation expectations.", "'QUESTION': Do you see the uncertainty easing with the ratification of USMCA and will it lead to increased business investment, or are trade tensions with China still a major obstacle?\n\n'ANSWER': Enacting the USMCA would remove some trade policy uncertainty and be positive for the economy. The ongoing negotiations with China also contribute to uncertainty, and removing that uncertainty would also benefit the economy.", "'QUESTION': Is one uncertainty bigger than the other?\n'ANSWER': The uncertainty surrounding the negotiations with China has had a greater impact on financial markets compared to the uncertainty surrounding the NAFTA and USMCA deals. The difference between NAFTA and USMCA is smaller than the difference between the current arrangements with China and the ongoing negotiations.", "QUESTION: Can you discuss the extent to which the Fed policy review is looking at the employment side of the mandate and the possibility of a more asymmetric reaction function with regard to unemployment?\n\nANSWER: The focus of the Fed policy review is on achieving both sides of the mandate. While inflation has been discussed more, the Fed has learned that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than previously thought. The Fed Listens events have highlighted high levels of unemployment in certain communities, informing their understanding of \"maximum employment.\" These events have been positive and will be repeated.", "'QUESTION': Is there a way to systematize insights and strategies for employment similar to those for inflation?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve has been lowering its estimates of maximum employment for several years, indicating that there is still slack in the labor market despite the current low unemployment rate. The risks of using accommodative monetary policy to explore this are relatively low, as highlighted by the ongoing policy review.", "QUESTION: Are you currently telling examiners not to prefer reserves over Treasuries for supervisory purposes? Are you talking to the Treasury Department about reducing volatility in their account at the Fed? What would drive the decision on whether or not to implement a standing repo facility?\n\nANSWER: The composition of banks' buffers varies, with some having more reserves and fewer Treasuries and vice versa. We have discussed this with supervisors. Regarding the Treasury General Account (TGA), we have not included it in our discussions yet, as we want Treasury to have the necessary cash. As for the standing repo facility, we are currently more focused on bill purchases, year-end operations, and regulatory issues. We believe there are noncontroversial changes that can be made to allow existing liquidity to flow more freely. However, implementing rule changes would take time.", "'QUESTION': What caused the change in the statement regarding uncertainties around the economy?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve mentioned global developments and muted inflation pressures in the statement. These factors have been monitored throughout the year, and appropriate policies have been implemented to address them. While they haven't disappeared, it was deemed appropriate to mention them, but a significant reassessment of the outlook would be needed to change the Fed's stance.", "'QUESTION': Are you worried that the high bar set for potential rate cuts next year due to the material reassessment aspect reduces your ability to act preemptively?\n'ANSWER': We have already cut rates three times this year, totaling 75 basis points. Monetary policy takes time to have full effects on the economy, so we need to wait and see. The Treasury yield curve has also moved significantly in the direction of higher accommodation. The FOMC will collectively judge whether a change in outlook merits a policy response based on a range of data and information.", "'QUESTION': Was the Fed too quick to raise interest rates in 2018?\n'ANSWER': In 2018, the Fed raised interest rates to make policy less accommodative, not to slow down the economy. The global economic slowdown and trade uncertainties have since weakened the economy, but it is not the Fed's role to make judgments on these factors.", "'QUESTION': What would be the economic effect if negotiations with China were to fall apart and how could the Fed support the economy in that event?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell stated that he wouldn't speculate on hypothetical situations. The Fed looks at various factors and tries to look through the volatility in trade news. Monetary policy is not the right tool to react in the short term to trade volatility, and he didn't want to discuss hypothetical outcomes.", "'QUESTION': Did you have any advice for the President regarding the potential volatility and impact of the economy?\n'ANSWER': I'm not going to discuss private meetings with elected officials or other officials, as it goes against our practice.", "'QUESTION': Have you mentioned the impeachment process against the President as potentially presenting risks for confidence in the economy?\n'ANSWER': No, we have not. We don't consider things like that.", "'QUESTION': Does the Fed's dot plot still serve a useful communications purpose, or do you feel that it might be time to retire it or change it in some fashion?\n'ANSWER': The dot plot can be useful if properly understood, but it has been a challenge. It represents the thinking of individual Committee members on monetary policy and the economy, but it is not discussed or negotiated at the meeting. Policy always depends on the economic outlook, and the dots are not a consideration when the outlook is changing. Focusing too much on the dots can cause one to miss the broader picture.", "QUESTION: Where does the concern about the framework and the removal of a 4 percent inflation rate come from?\n\nANSWER: The concern does not come from members of Congress. The Federal Reserve has been working on the framework all year and is currently in the process of analyzing the conclusions and potential modifications. It is premature to say that the framework is not going anywhere, and a 4 percent inflation target may not be credible or within the legal mandate. The goal is to make meaningful improvements to the monetary policy framework.", "'QUESTION': As you look back on the year, what things might you have done differently and what lessons will you take into next year?\n'ANSWER': My focus is on the present and getting policy right. I believe our current policy stance is appropriate and will likely remain so as long as the economic outlook remains favorable. We learn from the economy and our jobs every year, and we will always strive to learn lessons.", "'QUESTION': Are there any particular surprises in the economy or financial markets?\n'ANSWER': Yes, the challenges faced this year were unexpected. There was a belief that the economy was growing at around 3 percent, but we were surprised by the challenges. However, we are pleased with the actions taken to support the economy and believe they were appropriate. Currently, both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place.", "'QUESTION': Why aren't we seeing stronger wage gains?\n'ANSWER': Wage gains have increased from around 2 percent to 3-3.5 percent, but there are several factors holding back higher wage growth. Low productivity, globalization, and the possibility that the labor market may not be as tight as previously thought are all potential explanations. However, wages are increasing the most for lower-end workers, and overall wage growth is likely influenced by productivity.", "'QUESTION': Are there still more people on the sidelines who could join the labor force?\n'ANSWER': Yes, there may be more slack in the economy as indicated by higher participation rates and prime-age participation moving up steadily over the last few years. This provides more labor supply and contributes to a less tight labor market.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that the potential proposal for the Community Reinvestment Act without the Fed may cause confusion, and how would the mechanics work if this proposal is finalized without the Fed?\n\n'ANSWER': We believe the Community Reinvestment Act is important and are committed to ensuring banks provide credit to their communities, especially for low- and moderate-income households. We have been working to align with the OCC on a proposal, but if that is not possible, we hope to avoid confusion and tension between different regulatory regimes.", "'QUESTION': What would you need to see to call the labor market \"hot\"?\n'ANSWER': To call the labor market \"hot,\" higher wages would need to be seen. While there are many measures suggesting a strong labor market, the absence of significant wage increases indicates that it may not be tight. The average hourly earnings number of 3.1 percent and 3.7 percent for production and nonsupervisory workers are decent and healthy, respectively, but higher wages would be needed to consider it \"hot.\""]}
