Steve Liesman, CNBC .  Mr .

Do you and the Committee , Mr. Chairman, harbor doubts about the recent strength in the economy?  And are you and the Committee  baking i n additional quantitative easing in order to achieve the growth rates that you \u2019ve even forecast here?  Thank you. \n\nCHAIR MAN BERNANKE:  Steve, there \u2019s certainly been some encouraging news recently .  We \u2019ve seen slightly better performance in the labor market , consumer sentiment has January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    8 of 29 improved, i ndustrial production has been relatively strong \u2014so there are some positive signs, no doubt .  At the same time, we \u2019ve had mixed results in some other areas, such as retail sales , and we continue to see head winds emanating from Europe , coming from the slowing global economy and some other factors as well .  So, you know, we are obviously hoping that the strength we saw in the fourth quarter and in recent data will continue into 2012, but we \u2019re going to continue to monitor that situation .  I don\u2019 t think we \u2019re ready to declare that we \u2019ve entered a new , stronger phase at this point ; we\u2019ll contin ue to look at the data .  We will, as I \u2019ve said in my statement, and as we have in fact in the FOMC statement, you know, we continue to review our holdings \u2014our portfolio holdings, securities , and we are prepared to take further steps in that directi on if we  see that the recovery\u2019s  faltering or if inflation is not moving toward target.  So that \u2019s something \u2014that\u2019s  an option that \u2019s certainly on the table.  I think it would be premature to say definitively one way or the other, but we continue to look at that option , and if conditions warrant, we will certainly consider using it . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  I\u2019m a little confused by these  forecast s.  I was hoping you could sort of help me understand what we \u2019re looking at .  It seems to say that you expect that at the end of 2014, unemployment will be at or above 7 percent , inflation will be at or below 2 percent \u2014and yet 11 of the 17 members of your Committee  think that will be a good moment to start raising interest rates again .  If unemployment and inflati on are in fact symmetric objectives for the Fed, how can that possibly be the case?  And is there any tolerance for above -trend inflation in the service of catch -up growth?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, let me first observe that we have in fact , of course , been very accommodative in the last couple of years .  We \u2019ve ke pt interest rates close to zero , we\u2019ve done two rounds of asset purchases , we have announced\u2014today , in fact \u2014an extension of January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    9 of 29 the period over which we expect to see rates very low , and our maturity extension program is still ongoing, so we maintain a quite accommodative path of policy at this point .  I would further say that I think it\u2019 s important to emphasize that we \u2019re not going to mechanically take the interest rate projections that participants p rovide and just build policy off of that .  I mean , it\u2019s still going to be necessary for the Committee  to exercise collective judgment , to consider the cost s and risks  of additional policy actions, to discuss the uncertainty about the forecast and other factors that come into the policy decision.  Now, all that being said, if inflation is going to remain below target for an extended period, and unemployment progress is very slow, then I think your implicit question is right, t here is a case for additional policy action , and we \u2019ll\u2014you know, we want to continue to observe the situation, but we \u2019re certainly prepared to look for different ways to provide support to the economy if , in fact , we have this unsatisfactory situation . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi, Mr . Chairman, Craig Torres from Bloomberg News .  Congrats on the inflation target, or goal \u2014that\u2019s a big achievement for you, I \u2019m sure .  I\u2019d like to ask if you could explain a little bit the way you think inflation is now working in the economy .  The 2012 central tendency is kind of low , and along with that question, I \u2019d like to know where you think full employment is in the near  term , like the next year or t wo, given the structural impediments that many Fed officials have been talking about . \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, there are a number of factors that make us expect inflation to be quite low in the next couple of years .  Certainly, we are seeing a reversal , or at least a  flattening out, of the commodity price increases that caused headline inflation to rise earlier in 2011.  And the futures markets , and  our own estimates of supply and demand globally with the slowing global economy , suggest that most likely \u2014although, of course , there \u2019s a lot of uncertainty \u2014that commodity prices will remain well controlled over the next couple of years .  January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    10 of 29 On top of that , of course , we have a very high rate of unemployment ; pressure on wages is quite restrained .  And putting that t ogether with strong productivity gains, the cost s of production\u2014unit labor costs \u2014are growing very slowly .  Expectations of inflation seem well anchored  and, in fact, have been on the low side relative to recent history in recent months .  So for all those reasons, inflation looks to be at or modestly below th e 2 percent target going forward.  With respect to the maximum employment measure, we provided a \u2014we h ave been providing , in fact , for four years , as long as we\u2019ve been provi ding the economic projections \u2014an estimate of the long-run sustainable rate of unemployment , which is currently \u2014the central tendency is currently 5.2 to 6 percent .  That is higher than it was a couple of years ago, reflecting structural impediments and other changes .  We \u2019re concerned that the large amount of long -term unemployment may be causing some workers to lose skills or lose labor force attachment, which, at least for a while , will also likely increase the so -called natural rate, or sustainable rate, of unemployment .  So there are a number of factors working in that direction.  But in any case, while there \u2019s certainly a lot of uncertainty about exactly where the natural  rate of unemploy ment is, clearly , at 8\u00bd percent, I think we \u2019re comfortably above anybody \u2019s estimate , and for that reason, we still consider the labor market to be obviously quite slack. \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr . Chairman, how much confidence do you have in the FOMC \u2019s ability to forecast the economy and inflation out three  years?  And consequently, how much confidence do you have in the interest rate projections that the Fed has made public today, particularly the ones that go out to 2014 and beyond?   And if I may add a follow -up to that, there seems to be an asymm etry in these dots in that there \u2019s a view that the  view that matters the most to the Fed is the view of the January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    11 of 29 Chairman .  So when we look at these projections, are we really seeing the most likely expected path of interest rates because the C hairman \u2019s view is n\u2019t represented exclusively here?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, your first que stion \u2014our ability to forecast three and four years out is obviously very limited , there\u2019 s no question about that .  Nevertheless, we have to make a best guess, a provisional plan, in the same way that  a firm making  an investment has to make a best guess or provisional plan about where the economy and the industry is going to be over a number of years .  And s o it\u2019s certainly possible that we will be either too optimistic or too pessimi stic, in which case we\u2019 ll have to adjust both our forecasts and our policy expectations .  That being said, you know, currently, the zero  lower bound on policy rates \u2014at least according to many estimates \u2014is still binding ; that is, even if the economy were a bit stronger, the very low interest rates we currently have would still be valid, still be appropriate .  And so for that reason, unless there \u2019s a substantial stren gthening of the economy in the near  term, I would think that it \u2019s a pretty good guess that we  will be keeping rates low for some time from now .  We don\u2019 t identify the specific individuals who provide the projections .  Among other reasons, we want to make sure that people come to the meeting willing to talk and not be wedded to a specific position, and that \u2019s why , again , the Committee  makes a collective decision after using as input these projections , which are circulated to all the members of the Committee  before the meeting so that they can see what their colleagues believe.  As far as what indivi dual members do believe, we certainly have other vehicles for expressing our views .  All of us give speeches, all of us give interviews and are \u2014you know, I give frequent testimony, so there  are plenty of opportunities to get a sense of what individual members believe.  But again, we felt that this information , which presents both the diversity of views in the Committee  but also shows where the central tendencies lie,  would be useful .  And I guess I might add to that, you know, the January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    12 of 29 Chairman \u2019s term is not inf inite and a t some point there \u2019ll be a new C hairman, but there \u2019s a lot more continuity on the FOMC collectively .  The average Bank president is on the FOMC for a s much as 10 years and G overnors \u2019 terms  are 14 years .  So even as the C hairman changes, much of the FOMC remains continuous .  So, as we talk about interest rates in 2014, the fact that there is quite wide -ranging agreement that interest rates will be low for a long time, should give you more confidence that that \u2019s not dependent on a single individual .   GREG IP .  Greg Ip  of the Economist .  Mr .

We cannot cont rol, of course , where inflation  and unemployment are at each moment in time , and so there will be periods when, for reasons outside of our control, inflation and unemployment will move away from their desired levels .  If\u2014In those situations, the speed at which \u2014I think \u201c tolerate\u201d  might be too s trong of a word , because we always want to get everything , both sides of the mandate, back to their desired levels \u2014but the speed at which we would enforce that return would depend on what \u2019s happening with the other variable .

In the case of savers, you know, we think about all these issues , and we certainly recognize that  the low interest rates that we \u2019re using to try to stimulate investment and expansion of the economy also impose a cost on savers who have a lower return .  And we do hear about that , obviously , and we do think about that .  I guess the response I would make  is that the savers in our economy are dependent on a healthy economy in order to get adequate returns .  In particular, people ow n stocks and corporate bonds and ot her securities as well as , say, T reasury securities , and if our economy is in really bad shape, then January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    14 of 29 they are not going to get good returns on those investments .  So I think what we need to do, as is often the case when the economy goes into a very weak situation, then low interest rates are needed to help re store the economy to something closer to full employment and to increase growth and that , in turn, will lead  ultimately to higher return s across all assets for savers and investors .  So that \u2019s\u2014I think that \u2019s how we would explain it .  But again, you know, w e recognize that during periods like this, savers are getting a lower return .  One reason why it \u2019s extremely important for us to maintain price stability, of course, is that at least that minimizes any loss es due to inflation that savers might suffer . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi , Chairman .  Donna Borak of American Banker .  Shifting a little bit, I \u2019d like to take a look back to the rules that the Fed released back in late Decem ber.  Obviously, it was a mammoth task for F ed staff to put fort h, and considered the heart  of  Dodd\u2013Frank .  There were certain provisions that were left out , including the liquidity requirements , due  largely to the fact that there\u2019 s global consensus needed on those rules in the Basel III  process .  But I was hoping you could expand a little bit more on the decision for Fed staff to forgo specifying what the additional capital requirements would be for those banks that were n ot necessarily dee med GSIB s, at least now , but were still above the $50 billio n threshold, and to talk a little bit about what the core issues are in deciding whether or not that additional capital  should come in the form of a surcharge , what that surcharge might look like , and when we might know .\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, you\u2019 re referring , I think, to the 165\u2013166 rules , which will focus on the supervisory over sight of the largest banks .  It\u2019s a very big and complicated rule , as everyone knows , and so our position at this time is that we would still like to get feedback from the industry and from the public about what the best approach is .  So we put out a lot of January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    15 of 29 questions , and we \u2019ll be considering those dur ing the comment period and after , as we put together a  rule.  The notion of the surcharges is that banks which do not pose  significant threats to the systemic stability of Unites States, you know, should not have a significant surcharge .  We\u2019re required to consider these issues by Dodd\u2013 Frank, but our view is that i t\u2019s the largest banks, the ones whose failure would endanger our financial system , that should be subject to these surcharges  because , first \u2014because we need to have them be safer than smaller banks , and secondly, because we want to try to equalize the cost of credit tha t they face .  In other words, a bank which is thought to be too big to fail gets an artificial subsidy in the interest rate that it can borrow at , and by having additional c apital  requirements , that tends to equalize the cost of funding to different banks and reduces the incentive of banks to get large just to cr eate the impression of being too big to fail .  So we think those are important and we will continue to work with them .  The B asel Committee  has provided some sense of the range of what those surcharges will fall into , and so we \u2019re still working o n defining exactly the criteria , but you can assume th at it will be a fairly continuous  range between the $50 billion banks and the very largest banks in our economy .  As I said , we\u2019re getting reactions and comments .  We hope to get\u2014you know, early this year\u2014we hope to come back with a clarification on the rule , and of course, we \u2019re also working hard on implementing Basel  III itself , which we want to do during 2012\u2014we want to put out  the rule during 2012. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mark Felsenthal  with Reuters .  Mr . Chairman , for more than three years now, the Fed has conducted policy through extraordinary means , and yet the new information that we have today pertains mostly to an eventual tightening of policy through raising interest rates .  Why is there no new information about the size of the Fed \u2019s balance sheet , January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    16 of 29 and what should anybody looking at your communications  today deduce about an eventual expansion of  the balance sheet through more asset purchases?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  So we will be providing , in our minutes and in our S urvey of Economic P rojections , which will be released in three weeks \u2014we \u2019ll be providing some additional qualitative information about peoples \u2019\u2014participants \u2019 views of the balance sheet going forward .  The reason that I can \u2019t provide all that information now is basically that we received, you know, a whole range of qualitative comments , and we had further discussion during the meeting yesterday and today , and so, you know, we \u2019re going to need a little time to summarize that and to have it approved by, you know \u2014the minutes , of course , and the  SEP are approved by the entire Committee \u2014and so, in that respect , it will be a definitive statement about what we currently know about the balance sheet .  I can say a few things .  You know , one is that it certainly remains \u2014ex panding the balance sheet  certainly remains an option , one that we would consider very seriously if \u2014in particular , if progress toward full employment was continued, or it became more, inadequate , or if inflation remained  exceptionally low .  So we \u2019ll continue to look at that .  As we say in our statement, we \u2019re prepared to take additional measures in general, and that would be certainly one class of measures  we would want to consider .  I can make one additional point , which  maybe wasn \u2019t obvious, which is that , in June , we provided some principles relating the sales of assets \u2014ultimate sales of assets \u2014to the path of interest rates, and those remain \u2014those principles remain in force .  And so one implication of our extension of our expected point of take off to late 2014 is to imply that the initial sales from our balance sheet, which again are far down the road but \u2014that begins \u2014that will be later than previously thought .  That will be presumably in 2015.  So we do expect to hold our balance sheet at a high level for a longer period.  Additional sales again \u2014I\u2019m sorry \u2014Additional purchases remains a topic that we January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    17 of 29 are still debating , and it will depend both on our assessment of the efficacy and the risks of that particular tool , but als o of how the economy is evolving.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr . Chairman, wh en I look at these forecasts for 2014, the media n of the forecast is , I think, 0.75 and the mean is 1.12 percent .  If I were to draw a line through this \u2014these dots, how should I draw it so I best understand what the FOMC is most likely to do?  And the second part \u2014in the minutes, you say that the Committee  will consider further options for improvements to the SEP, the economic projections .  Could you t ell us a bit more about what further you might do?  Thank you. \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, again, first I want to emphasize that there is no mechanical relationship between these projections and the outcomes of the FOMC decisions .  Of course, they \u2019re a big  input into those decisions , but it \u2019s a collective decision .  If you want to draw lines, I guess I would\u2014 I guess my suggestion would be to look at the median, the middle of the distribution , because we do have a democratic process in the Committee , and so the median would give you some se nse of where the weight balances against higher \u2014in favor of higher or lower rates .  Again, we did note that in support of our assessment of late 2014, which is a Committee  decision , and of course there was a 9- to-1 vote in favor of that, but that is supported by the observation that 11 of the 17 participants expect the funds rate at the end of 2014 to be 1 percent or l ess, and so presumably the take off would not be much earlier than that .  In terms of future additions, there are a lot of ways we could go.  W e could provide, for example, more relationship s between \u2014more information about the relationship between individuals \u2019 policy preferences and their forecasts , and so on.  But there \u2019s nothing specific now that  has b een decided .  We have a very capable sub committee , which is charged with continual assessment and analysis of possible ways of improving our transparency .  So we will be looking at additional January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    18 of 29 possibilities , and we would welcome feedback for that matter .  But there \u2019s nothing specific planned at this point . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Derek Kravitz, Associated Press .  Last night the P resident unveiled a plan to revamp and expand the government \u2019s refinancing program .  Essent ially, the Fed released a white p aper earlier this month that said that up to 2\u00bd million homeowners could benefit from  this, essentially save $3,000 per year in mortgage payments .  Right now there \u2019s a mortgage settlement being broker ed between state attorney s general and the nation\u2019 s majo r mortgage lenders, something to the tune of $25 billion, much of which would be in the form of principal reduction.  In the white p aper that was released earlier this month, the Fed seemed to indicate that principal reduction could be helpful , but it was unclear about whether they  thought that this was an acceptable or even feasible option .  They also made clear that a lot of the proposals that are currently out there \u201ceat around the edges, \u201d so to speak, when you \u2019re dealing with a foreclosure crisis , and a  lot of economi sts agree .  Do you think a principal reduction in the form of the major mortgage settlement would do a lot to help the housing crisis ?  And if not, is there any other alternative proposal that would help?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well , the Feder al Reserve obviously has a very strong interest in the housing sector .  The weakness of the housing sector is an important reason why the economy is not recovering more robustly, and the problems in housing finance are part of the reason why monetary polic y has not been more powerful \u2014because part of our transmission mechanism is through lower interest rates , which affects refinancing ; it affects sales and purchases as well .  So, in addition to that, as bank supervisors, we have considerable interest in servicing, in loan modifications, in delinquencies , and all the aspects of mortgage lending .  So we have a considerable interest in this area, and as you say , we did a white paper , which looked January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    19 of 29 at a number of issues , including refinancing and mortgage finance .  I think it \u2019s important to say that our intent in that white paper was to provide the benefit of our analysis to the public and to those who will be making policy .  We did not take specific stands on individual issues .  What we tried to do was  provide the pros and the cons and provide some context for these debates .  So we did discuss refinancing, we did discuss principal forgiveness .  I would say that there \u2019s a variety of views about principal forgiveness within the Federal Reserve System , and there is n o official position.  There\u2014 It seems very likely that principal forgiveness could be helpful , depending on how it \u2019s structured , in reducing delinquencies .  There are also some potential drawbacks ; one of them is the fact that the amount of negative equity in the United States is about $700 billion, which is enormous, and so there is no conceivable program that is going to put ever ybody in the country above water .  And so I think the issue then becomes, if we have $20 or $25 billion or whatever the number ma y end up being in this settlement, you know, what is the most cost -effective way to help as many people as possible?  A nd I think that \u2019s an ongoing debate .  But with respect to principal reduction, you know , I\u2019ve spoken about this in the past , and it certainly has some advantages ; a lot depends on how it \u2019s structured, and a lot depends on what the alternatives are that you \u2019re considering . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, M r. Chairman .  Peter Barnes of FOX  Business.  One of the goals of the Fed and the release of  all these new materials, the forecast , and the policy announcement are to help to create expectations and set expectations .  But are you concerned at all that this \u2014that the materials and the forecast s and the policy announcement path today  might help create negative expectations ?  In other words, the average American \u2019s takeaway of your announcement to keep interest rates low \u2014exceptionally low , through 2014 now , might signal to them that maybe the Fed thinks that the economy is in much worse shape than we a ll thought , January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    20 of 29 and that , in turn, could affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, and the ability to create a self -sustaining economic recovery at some point .  Is there a risk of this?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Well, whenever the Fed takes a policy action , there\u2019s always some potential for a signal.  I mean, that \u2019s true not just in these current times , but anytime the Fed lowers or increases interest rates, and that \u2019s something we have to think about .  But I think, generally speaking, that those considerations  are outweighed by the need to maintain accommodative financial conditions  so that it\u2019 s attractive to firms to invest and hire, attractive for those who are eligible to buy homes, and so on, and I think that that ultimately is more powerful than the signal  from the change in policy .  In particular , the markets and the news media are very good at picking up the underlying economic data and making assessments of the state of the economy and reporting what different people think about the economy, so I wouldn\u2019 t overstate the Fed \u2019s ability to massively change expectations through its statements, for example .  So, again, I think that while we certainly take that into account, we think it \u2019s important for us to say what we think, and we think it \u2019s important for us to provide the right amount of stimulus to try to help our economy recover from its currently underutilized condition. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report .  Let me kind of follow up on Peter \u2019s question.  W hy shouldn\u2019 t somebody looking at  these numbers from the outside say \u201cLook, as aggressive as you say you \u2019ve been, and as aggressive as you have been, it doesn\u2019 t look like you\u2019 re meeting any of your goals for the next three years on the economy, so why isn\u2019 t the Fed doing more now? \u201d\n\nCHAIR MAN BERNANKE:  Well, again, as I said earlier, the Fed has been doing a great deal.  Just since August we have put a date on our expected period of low interest rates .  We undertook the maturity extension program , which is still continuing .  Today we announced a January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    21 of 29 further extension of the expected pe riod of low rates .  By issuing this  expected policy rate information, we hope to convey to the market the extent to which there is support on the Committee  for maintaining rates at a low level for a significant time .  So, you know, I don\u2019 t accept the premise that we\u2019 ve been passive ; we\u2019ve been actually quite active in our policy , and in one respect, the low level of inflation is a validation in the following  sense , that there were some who we re very concerned that our balance sheet policies and the like would lead to high inflation .  There\u2019 s certainly no sign of that yet , and it hasn \u2019t shown up either in financial m arkets or in outside forecaster s\u2019 expectatio ns.  Now that being said, as I mentioned earlier, if the situation continues , with inflation below target and unemployment declining at a rate which is very, very slow, then more \u2014our framework, the logic of our framework, says  we should be looking for ways  to do more .  It\u2019s not completely straightforward because, of course, we \u2019re now dealing with a variety of nonstandard policy tools \u2014we can \u2019t just lower the federal funds rate 25 basis points like in the good old days \u2014but your basic point is right , that, you know, we need to adopt policies that will both achieve our inflation objectives and help the economy recover as quickly as  is feasible.  A nd, I would say that your question\u2014actually , an earlier question \u2014shows a benefit of explaining this framework because  the framework makes very clear that we need to be thinking about ways in which we can provide further stimulus if we don\u2019 t get some improvement in the pace of recovery and a normalization of inflation . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mr . Chairman, Patrick Welter  from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.  I have two short questions .  Your predecessor, Mr . Greenspan, once said about his personal inflation\u2014long- term inflation goal that it would be 0 percent  if appropriately measured .  And I would like you to compare the in flation goal you told us about today with that statement .  And, the second question is , Comparing  what you did today, are you approaching more some January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    22 of 29 kind of inflation target ers like the c entral b ank of Sweden or Norway , or are you approaching more the European Central Bank , for example, which has some kind of inflation goal but is not really an inflation target er? \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Excellent questions .  So, a literal reading of price stability would say inflation should be at zero.  Now, there are some technical reasons why that may not be true .  There are probably some measurement biases and other issues that mean that a measured value of inflation above zero is probably consistent with stable prices .  But as we \u2019ve talked about frequently, we set inflation \u2014our inflation objective in a way that was consistent with both sides of the mandate :  price stability \u2014and 2 percent is low enough that we believe that it\u2019s not going to extensively interfere with financial planning and economic planning on the pa rt of households and businesses \u2014but also in the interest of employment .   A target for inflation that was zero would have seve ral consequences .  First, we would be spending maybe half of our time , or at least a significant amount of our time , in a deflatio nary zone .  And we \u2019ve seen in many instances that deflation can be bad for economic performance and bad for employment , and , therefore, setting an inflation target at zero would be not  consistent with the other part of our mandate .  Incidentally, related t o that, a zero inflation rate would mean that nominal interest rates would be at very low levels, typically 2 to 3 percent or whatever they might be , and that would increase the risk and probability that we would be in a  situation like today where we reall y can \u2019t cut the short -term interest rate any further .  So I think there are good reasons from a dual -mandate perspective to have inflation greater than 2 percent .  And I would add that , you know, if you look at central banks around the world, whether they are nominal inflation targeters or not, that 2 percent is basically the number that most central banks January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    23 of 29 use; the ECB, many other central banks either us e 2 percent or a range around 2  percent .  So this is not at all different from what many other central banks do .   Now, are we inflation targeters ?  If by \u201c inflation targeter \u201d you mean a central bank that puts top priority on inflation and other goals , like employment, as subsidiary goals , then the answer is no .  We are a dual -mandate central bank :  We put equal weight on price stability and maximum employment;  those are the goals given to us by the Congress .  And so, in that respect, as I mentioned earlier , I think, to Greg, we \u2019re not absolutists :  If there \u2019s a need to let inflation return a little bit more slowly to target in order to get a better result in employment, then that \u2019s something that we would be willing to do .  Having said all that, I think it\u2019 s worth noting that even banks that \u2014central banks that call themselves inflation targeters typically pay at least some attention to other parts of the economy :  employment , growth, financial stability , and the like .  So I don\u2019 t think there \u2019s really any central bank , or very few , at least , that focus only on inflation.  But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve because we are going to be evenhanded in  treating the price stability and maximum employment parts of our mandate on a level footin g. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  Zach Goldfarb from the Washington Post .  Two questions .  First, can you clarify whether if actual economic conditions match their projections, that\u2019s an acceptable future course, or that would require additional easing?  And secondly, in the past, a number of times you said that even when interest r ates are at the zero bound, the Fed  can still have a significant impact on influencing economic growth ; do you still believe that the Fed has the capacity to deploy tools that would have a significant impact on bringing down unemployment at a faster pace than we see in these projections if it chose to do so?  January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    24 of 2\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  On the first question, I , you know \u2014as was pointed out by Steve, for example\u2014we \u2019ve had some good data recently .  I think there \u2019s some uncertainty about where the economy is going , and we want to continue to observe how the economy is developing .   But I would say that, as I \u2019ve said on several \u2014in several answers, that if recovery continues to be modest and progress on unemployment very slow , and if inflation appears to be likely to be below target for a number of years out \u2014so the configuration we \u2019re talking about in the projections \u2014then I think there would be a very strong case , based on our framework, for finding a different \u2014additional tools for expansionary policies or to support the economy .  So we\u2019ll continue to look at the different options and try to decide what might be most effective .   We are in a difficult situation in terms of the effectiveness of policy tools .  My own view , thinking about the effects, for example, of additional purchases \u2014additional securities purchases, I\u2019ve been pretty satisfied in the sense that \u2014in the following sense, that purchases do seem to have the desired effects on f inancial conditions :  They tend to ease financial conditions, they tend to lower interest rates, they tend to strengthen asset prices .  And those are exactly the kinds of things that monetary policy normally does in order to try to provide stableness to the economy .  What has been a bit more uncertain is the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism .  And we have seen some developments in the economy that have probably weakened the effectiveness of policy , including , notably , the housing sector , where one would expect \u2014with mortgage rates below 4 percent, one would expect to see more ac tivity than we \u2019ve been seeing .  And the problems in housing finance and so on are part of the reason that the  expansionary stimulus is not feeding through as much as we would like to the real economy .  I would not say , though, that our policies are \u2014that we \u2019re out of ammunition.  No, I think we still have tools , but we need to January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    25 of 29 further analyze and study those tools and try to make comparisons in terms of effectiveness, risks , and the like .  So I think we still have a process to figure out what is the most effective approach .  Does that \u2014yeah, okay . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Steve  Beckner, Market News International , Mr. Chairman, with a  question about the new forward guidance language i n the statement itself .  And Peter anticipated one of my questions  about the potential danger of it  sending a negative signal , but let me ask, What was the rationale for continuing to have forward guidance phraseology instead of just letting these forecast s, these new forecasts of the funds  rates , speak for themselves?\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  No,  that\u2019 s a very good question.  I might have commented on Zach\u2019 s question that our two main tools at this point \u2014given that short -term interest  rates  are close to zero \u2014are asset purchases, but the other is communications .  And to  the extent that we can communicate that rates will be lower for longer, that will ease financial conditions and be a way that we can affect the state of the economy .  And that \u2019s part of the reason \u2014other than just a general desire for transparency \u2014that we brought out some of these ideas at this point .  The reason that we just don\u2019 t release the economic projections and leave it at that is because, while the economic projections of future policy  rates are an important input to our policy discussions around the table, the decision ultimately is made by the Federal Open Market Committee , you know, which is the voters sitting around the table, and in a  process by which we exchange ideas and make arg uments and come to a collective determination .  So, you know, we don\u2019 t set the federal funds interest rate by having members send in their vote and not having a meeting ; we have a meeting for a reason, which is to talk to each other and try to come to some  kind of consensus .  So the FOMC will always, in some sense, trump the projections of forward interest January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    26 of 29 rates , but clearly, because the participants and the people around the table are the same, the projections  should give significant information about wher e the FOMC is likely to go . \n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Scott Spoerry , sir, from CNN .  My head \u2019s full of questions, but I \u2019m going to try and limit it to two related questions .  You\u2019re linking your inflation target of 2 percent to the PCE .  The PCE is something that hundreds of millions of Americans have no idea what it is ; they do know what the CPI is .  Can you explain, in layman \u2019s term s, something that regular folks might understand, why they should not worry too much when infl ation by the\u2014if the CPI is different than the PCE ?  And the second question is related also to inflation January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    27 of 29 and to the targeting because  the Fed\u2019s always been a little bit vague in terms of what sort of inflation it w ould accept , and this is a marked  change .  Because criticism of the Federal Reserve\u2014criticism of you , but the institution itself has been so intense this year because it \u2019s a political year \u2014there are people out there who are going to say \u201cT he Federal Reserve has  finally just admitted it.  Their pol icy is to destroy 2 percent of the value of my dollars every year.\u201d   How are you going to respond to those people ?  And also, could you answer the question about the CPI and the PCE ?  Thank you. \n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  Sure .  Well, we chose the PCE index for  some , I think, very valid technical reasons .  It better allows \u2014better accounts for changes in people \u2019s purchasing patterns ; you know, when some  things become more expensive, people will tend to move to other types of goods and services .  That \u2019s not accounted for by the CPI , which has fixed weight s.  It also \u2014the PCE \u2014I think more relevant to the average person , the PCE includes all health -care costs, not just out -of-pocket cost s, and that has two benefits .  One is , it reduces the share of the inflation index  which is tied to housing .  And the CPI ha s a very large share devoted to housing , and a large share of that part of the index is imputed\u2014t hat is , essentially made- up numbers .  So that\u2019s one benefit , to keep the \u2014you know, not  to put too much weight on the imputed housing numbers , which is part of the CPI .  The other is that , even if people are not paying for health care immediately out -of-pocket, they do pay for it , either through taxes or through reduced wages as , you know, i ncreased health -care costs raise insurance premi ums for employers .  So I think this is probably a better measure of the inflation that \u2019s faced by typical consumers than the CPI is .  That being said, these various measures \u2014the CPI and others, PCE i ndex and others \u2014move very closely together , and you \u2019re not going to have a situation where the CPI is 10  percent and the PCE is 2 percent .  There may be a few tenths difference, but , generally speaking, they move very January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    28 of 29 closely together .  So, in that respect, I think if people look at the CPI, they should feel pretty comfortable that, you know, that \u2019s going to be very close to where the PCE inflation is . On the 2 percent, again, that \u2019s where the United States has been for many years .  That \u2019s where most c entral banks are around the world.  There\u2019 s a very good reason for it , which is to avoid deflation, which is very negative .  I think the argument that, you know, the value of your dollar declines at  2 percent a year is just not really a very good one , unless you\u2019 re one  of those people who does their lifetime saving in the mattress .  Most people invest in various kinds of instruments , receiving a rate of interest .  And now , it\u2019s true , as has been pointed out , that for the moment interest rates are pretty low , but they \u2019re still positive .  But over a longer period of time , if you \u2014even if you have money in a CD or some other investment vehicle, the interest rate will compensate you for inflation.  I mean , the two will be tied together .  And so the re really shouldn\u2019 t be, you know \u2014at levels of inflation this low , interest rate s should pretty much fully compensate for the losses to savers .  But I would reiterate that  we are not unaware of the problems that low interest rates cause for savers, cause for pension fund contributions , insurance companies , and other parts of the economy , and we do try to take that into account as we think about other ramifications of our policy . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, M r. Chairman .  Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television.  Two questions , if I could, separate from your role here as Fed Chairman .  Two issues in Congress right now , on which your advice might be worthwhile .  The payroll tax cut is coming up for debate again, this debate about whether to extend it for a full year .  What is your assessment  right now of the impact that would have on the U.S . economy if it was not extended?  A nd likewise, what if the Congress were to not implement the 1.2 on automatic spending cuts imposed by the failure of the super committee \u2014what impact would that have on the U.S . economy?   January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL    29 of 2\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE:  .  Well, as you know, the Federal Reserve makes it a policy to try to avoid commenting on specific individual tax and spending programs , and I don\u2019 t have those numbers at hand in any case .  But what I would say is the fol lowing \u2014is that what I \u2019ve tried to convey to Congress , and I think many other economists have taken the same view, is that responsible fiscal policy has at least two components at this point .  One is , of course , importantly , to achieve fiscal sustainability .  And to achieve fiscal sustainability over a long period of time , we need to be acting soon \u2014now  would be preferable \u2014to making credible commitments to reducing spending, to improving our programs, to modifying or simplifying our tax code, and so on, s o as the ways that will be persuasive to the markets or to the public that over the longer term, over the next 10, 20, 30 years , that our fiscal position will be sustainable .  So that \u2019s an important thing to do.  It relates to the second part of your question.  I think it \u2019s important to take steps at least to \u2014again, the specific steps are up to Congress , but it \u2019s important that action be taken to provide a credible plan to achieve fiscal sustainability .   The second part of my recommendation, though, is that we need at this juncture to be sensitive to the effects of whatever policy decisions are made on what is still a very fragile recovery .  Again, there are many ways to do that , but I think that should be taken in to account as people are looking at policy al ternatives in terms of taxes or spending .   Thank you.  \n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 5, "dovish": 22, "neutral": 43}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 0, "dovish": 3, "neutral": 14}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 5, "dovish": 25, "neutral": 57}, "speech_summary": "In the FOMC meeting, the Committee announced that they will maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy to support economic recovery and ensure inflation is consistent with their mandate. They also decided to keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels until late 2014 and continue the program to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities.The purpose of increasing transparency and predictability of policy is widely agreed upon as it facilitates well-informed decision-making, reduces uncertainty, enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy, and improves accountability. The Committee is committed to fulfilling its mandate of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, taking into account the longer-run goals, medium-term outlook, and assessment of risks to the financial system.The maximum level of employment in an economy is determined by nonmonetary factors and cannot be fixed by a central bank, but the central bank can estimate this level and use it to inform policy decisions. The central bank considers a range of indicators to assess maximum employment, which may change over time, and if the assessments point to an increase in maximum employment, the policy strategy would be adjusted accordingly.Low and stable inflation can promote growth in output and employment in the long term, but there may be circumstances where the dual objectives of price stability and maximum employment are not complementary. In such cases, the Committee takes a balanced approach, considering the magnitude of deviations and projected time horizons for inflation and employment to return to desired levels.Global financial market strains continue to pose significant risks to the economic outlook. However, economic activity is expected to gradually accelerate in the future due to improving consumer and business confidence, better financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy.Survey measures and financial market indicators suggest that longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The Committee anticipates that inflation will run at or below the mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent, with projections indicating subdued inflation through 2014.The chart labeled \"Appropriate Pace of Policy Firming\" provides more detail on participants' assessments of the target federal funds rate in the coming years. The Committee is prepared to provide further monetary accommodation if employment does not improve or if inflation remains below its target rate.\"The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\" \n\nSummary: The Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low until the labor market improves and inflation reaches and exceeds 2 percent. They will also continue to buy Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities until there is significant progress towards their employment and price stability goals.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Do you and the Committee harbor doubts about the recent strength in the economy? And are you baking in additional quantitative easing to achieve growth rates?\n'ANSWER': There have been some positive signs in the labor market and consumer sentiment, but mixed results in other areas and headwinds from Europe and the global economy. The strength in the economy is not yet declared as a new, stronger phase. The Committee will continue to monitor the situation and consider further steps, including quantitative easing, if necessary.", "'QUESTION': How can the Fed justify raising interest rates when unemployment and inflation are not meeting their targets?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has been accommodative with low interest rates and asset purchases. The interest rate projections provided by participants are not the sole basis for policy decisions. If inflation remains below target and unemployment progress is slow, there is a case for additional policy action to support the economy.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain how inflation is currently working in the economy and where you think full employment is in the near term?\n'ANSWER': Inflation is expected to be low in the next couple of years due to factors such as the flattening out of commodity price increases and restrained wage pressure. The cost of production is growing slowly and inflation expectations are well anchored. The estimate for the long-run sustainable rate of unemployment is currently 5.2 to 6 percent, reflecting structural impediments and changes. The high rate of long-term unemployment may increase the natural rate of unemployment. The labor market is still considered to be slack.", "'QUESTION': How much confidence does the FOMC have in its ability to forecast the economy and inflation three years out? \n'ANSWER': The ability to forecast three to four years out is limited, but the FOMC still makes provisional plans. The current low interest rates would still be appropriate unless there is a substantial strengthening of the economy. The FOMC does not identify specific individuals who provide projections, but there are other opportunities to express individual views. The FOMC aims to provide a sense of the diversity of views within the committee. The fact that there is wide-ranging agreement on low interest rates for a long time should give confidence that it is not dependent on a single individual.", "'QUESTION': If inflation were to move somewhat above the 2 percent preferred level, would you tolerate that in order to make further progress on unemployment?\n'ANSWER': We treat the goals of price stability and maximum employment symmetrically, but the speed at which we would enforce a return to target would depend on what is happening with the other variable. If inflation goes above target but unemployment is high, we would be more cautious and slower in returning to target.", "'QUESTION': Can you comment on the hostility towards you in the Republican presidential debates and address the concerns of Republican primary voters on fixed incomes?\n'ANSWER': I will not engage in political rhetoric. My focus is on helping the Federal Reserve achieve its goals. Low interest rates may impact savers, but a healthy economy is necessary for them to get adequate returns. Maintaining price stability minimizes any losses due to inflation for savers.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain the decision to not specify additional capital requirements for banks above the $50 billion threshold and discuss the core issues in deciding whether this additional capital should come in the form of a surcharge?\n\n'ANSWER': The Fed is seeking feedback from the industry and the public on the best approach for the 165-166 rules, which focus on supervisory oversight of the largest banks. The idea behind surcharges is that banks that do not pose significant threats to the US financial system should not have a significant surcharge. The goal is to make larger banks safer and equalize the cost of credit they face. The Basel Committee has provided a range for these surcharges, and the Fed is still working on defining the criteria. They hope to provide a clarification on the rule early this year and implement Basel III during 2012.", "'QUESTION': Why is there no new information about the size of the Fed's balance sheet and what should anybody looking at your communications today deduce about an eventual expansion of the balance sheet through more asset purchases?\n'ANSWER': We will provide additional qualitative information about participants' views of the balance sheet in our minutes and Survey of Economic Projections. We need time to summarize the qualitative comments and have them approved. Expanding the balance sheet remains an option if progress towards full employment is inadequate or if inflation remains low. We are still debating additional purchases and it will depend on the efficacy and risks of that tool and the evolving economy.", "'QUESTION': How should I draw a line through the forecasts to understand what the FOMC is most likely to do? Can you provide more information on future improvements to the economic projections?\n'ANSWER': There is no direct relationship between the projections and FOMC decisions. Drawing a line through the median would give an idea of where the weight balances for higher or lower rates. Future improvements could include providing more information on the relationship between policy preferences and forecasts, but nothing specific has been decided yet.", "'QUESTION': Do you think a principal reduction in the form of the major mortgage settlement would do a lot to help the housing crisis? And if not, is there any other alternative proposal that would help?\n'ANSWER': Principal reduction could be helpful in reducing delinquencies, but the amount of negative equity in the US is enormous, so no program can put everyone above water. The most cost-effective way to help as many people as possible is an ongoing debate, and the effectiveness of principal reduction depends on its structure and alternative proposals.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that the release of new materials and the announcement to keep interest rates low might create negative expectations and affect consumer confidence and spending?\n'ANSWER': While there is always a potential for a signal when the Fed takes a policy action, the need to maintain accommodative financial conditions outweighs the risk. The markets and news media are good at assessing the state of the economy, so the Fed's ability to massively change expectations through its statements is limited. The Fed believes it is important to provide the right amount of stimulus to help the economy recover.", "'QUESTION': Why isn't the Fed doing more now to meet its goals for the economy?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has been active in its policy, with measures such as setting a date for low interest rates, the maturity extension program, and extending the expected period of low rates. The low level of inflation validates the Fed's balance sheet policies. If the situation continues with low inflation and slow unemployment decline, the Fed will consider additional stimulus measures.", "'QUESTION': How does the inflation goal mentioned today compare to former Chairman Greenspan's goal of 0 percent inflation?\n'ANSWER': While a literal reading of price stability would suggest zero inflation, there are measurement biases and other factors that make a measured value above zero consistent with stable prices. Setting an inflation target at zero would not align with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and employment. Most central banks, including the ECB, use a 2 percent inflation target. The Federal Reserve is a dual-mandate central bank, giving equal weight to price stability and maximum employment.", "'QUESTION': Can the Fed still have a significant impact on economic growth and unemployment even when interest rates are at zero?\n'ANSWER': The Fed believes that if the recovery continues to be modest and progress on unemployment is slow, and if inflation remains below target for several years, there would be a strong case for finding additional tools for expansionary policies. The effectiveness of policy tools is uncertain, but the Fed still believes it has tools and needs to further analyze and study their effectiveness.", "'QUESTION': What was the rationale for continuing to have forward guidance phraseology instead of just letting the new forecasts of the funds rates speak for themselves?\n'ANSWER': Forward guidance is an important tool for the Federal Reserve, as it allows them to communicate that rates will be lower for longer, which can ease financial conditions and impact the state of the economy. While economic projections are important, the ultimate decision is made by the Federal Open Market Committee through a collective determination process. The projections should give significant information about where the FOMC is likely to go.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain, in layman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terms, why regular folks should not worry too much when inflation by the CPI is different than the PCE?\n'ANSWER': The PCE index better accounts for changes in purchasing patterns and includes all healthcare costs, reducing the weight on imputed housing numbers. Even if people are not paying for healthcare out-of-pocket, they still pay for it through taxes or reduced wages. The CPI and PCE move closely together, so people can feel comfortable that CPI inflation will be close to PCE inflation.", "'QUESTION': What is the impact of not extending the payroll tax cut and not implementing the automatic spending cuts on the US economy?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve does not comment on specific tax and spending programs, but fiscal sustainability is important. It is necessary to make credible commitments to reducing spending and improving programs to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. Additionally, policy decisions should consider the effects on the fragile recovery."]}
