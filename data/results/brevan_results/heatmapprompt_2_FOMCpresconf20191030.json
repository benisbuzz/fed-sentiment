Television.  So I guess the question is , is this it?  Do you consider rates to be accommodative enough now to achieve your goal of sustaining the expansion?  And as  far as global Wall Street\u2019 s primary question, what kind of change in the economy would cause you to reassess \u2014some sort of sig nificant deterioration in what?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So what we \u2019ve said, to repeat , is that we see the current stance of policy as \u201c likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook.\u201d   And we say that, really, becau se both of the performance of the economy and the stance of policy.  The performance of the economy has been \u2014particularly the household sector \u2014has been strong, has been resilient , with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, l abor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending.  The manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing , and also investment and exports have been weaker.  But, overall, we \u2019ve seen moderate gro wth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up.  We see the outlook a s for more of the same.  We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps having moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting  period, although, some remain \u2014some things remain to be seen.  So that \u2019s the economy.  Turning to policy, we \u2019ve moved the stance of policy over  the course of the year to a more accommodative stance, and , after the cuts a t the last three meetings, the federal funds r ate is now   in a range between 1 \u00bd and 1\u00be percent .  We feel that policy is well positioned to support the outlook that I described.  So you asked what it would take, you know, to move, and, as I mentioned, we \u2019re going to be watching all factors ,  And if developments emerge that c ause a  material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  But that \u2019s what it would take:  a materi al reassessment of our outlook.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could follow up\u2014i f the markets decide that you need to cut rates again , will you be for ced to follow?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: We\u2019ll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about the risks to the outlook, and I \u2019ve given you a sense of what our outlook is.  It\u2019 s for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 perce nt objective.  If something happens to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that \u2019s what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate stance of policy.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post .  You just said that the risks to the outlook are moving in a positive direction.  I\u2019m wondering if you could specify\u2014is that on trade , or are there other matters?   This morning we obviously learned that we \u2019ve now had two quarters of contracting business investment , which would seem to be moving the outlook in the other direction.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So , in terms of risks, what I was referring to there \u2014the principal risks that we \u2019ve been monitoring have been, really , slowing global growth  and trade policy developments  as well as muted inflat ion pressure.  So  I was really referring there to trade developments.  We have that phase -one potential agreement with China, which, if signed and put into effect , could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and re ducing uncertainty, and that would bode well, we think, for business confidence and perhaps activity over time.  So  that has   the potential for being an improvement in the risk picture.   Brexit , I would say, as well \u2014it appears that the risk of a no -deal Brexit seems to have materially declined.  I think on both situations there \u2019s plenty of risk left, but I\u2019 d have to say that t he risks seem to have subsided.  You asked  about business investment, and that \u2019s right.  Business investment has been weak , and t oday \u2019s reading was weak as well .  And it was broad acro ss equipment and other parts of\u2014all parts of business fixed investment were weak.  That \u2019s consistent with what we \u2019ve seen, but that \u2019s the economy we \u2019ve had this year.  What we \u2019ve had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth , and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent  in this quarter \u2014in this first reading for the quarter.  So, overall, we see the economy as having been resilient to the \u2014you know, the winds that have been blowing this year.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Can I just follow up quickly?  I mean , there \u2019s this concern that I sometimes hear that , with business , businesses have cut investment , and are they going to turn around and cut employment?  You know, sort of , if they continue to be concerned.  Can  you give a sense of how the C ommittee is thinking\u2014thi nking through that possibility?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes, so that is a risk.  That \u2019s a risk that we\u2019 ve been monitoring, but we don\u2019 t see it yet.  We don\u2019 t see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that.  But the risk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing\u2014 in export investment , business investment , parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy, we really don \u2019t see that.  What we continue to see is good job creation.  U nemployment has declined again, and the household survey is now at a 50- year low \u2014has been, you know, very close to 50- year low s for 18 months now.  So it \u2019s very positive.  The consumer -facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on,   you know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that \u2019s their principle focus.  So that is the thing that \u2019s pushing the economy forward, and it doesn\u2019 t seem to have been affected so far by weakness in the other areas.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.  Thanks for taking our questions.  So you\u2019 ve previously sort of  compared this rate -cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in the \u201990s, and in both of those instances, the Greenspan F ed took those cuts back after a while.  They raised rates again fairly quickly.  And I guess I \u2019m just curious what the onus is for doing that in this cycle.  Wh at would make you guys decide it \u2019s appropriate to raise interest rates again\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So the reason why we raised interest rates is because \u2014generally is because we see inflation as moving up \u2014or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really don\u2019t see that now.  Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year.  We thought that that was due , to some extent , to idiosyncratic or transient  factors.   That turns out to have been the case, so it \u2019s moved back up.  But it seems to be settling in below 2  percent .  So we really don\u2019 t see that risk . And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways \u2014both surveys and market based over the course of this \u2014of, really , the recent mont hs.  And, you know, we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we \u2019re strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent  inflation objective on a symmetric basis.   We think it \u2019s essential that we do that.  So we \u2019re not thinking about raising rates right now.  There obviously will be times in the future where that will be appropriate.  What we \u2019re really thinking now is that our current stance   of policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is broadly in  keeping with our expectations\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. \u2014Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, I \u2019m\u2014not to make light of it, but I \u2019m a little bit\u2014 I wonder if you could help me out with the appropr iate understanding of the word \u201cappropriate\u201d  here.  S o the statement says  that the Committee  is going \u201cto monitor the implications of incoming information for the outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range. \u201d  That tells me you could go either way.  You  came in , and you used the word \u201c appropr iate,\u201d that the current rate is \u201clikely to remain appropriate ,\u201d which means you\u2019 re on hold.  So how do I walk away from this, and what should we walk away from this believing what \u201c appropriate \u201d means?  Are you on hold and need to be proved wrong that you should rem ain on hold, or is it , really , you could go either way here?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate \u2014likely to remain appropriate \u2014as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent .  That\u2019s\u2014so that \u2019s what we\u2019 re saying about that.  We also say, of course, if developments emerge that cause a  material reassessment of that outlook, we would respond accordingly.  So that \u2019s really how we \u2019re thinking about it.  I can \u2019t point to one data point or one thing that would change our minds.  It really \u2014it would be a reassessment of \u2014a material reassessment  of our overall outlook, which is what I described.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: I \u2019m sorry, just  to\u2014why isn\u2019 t the phrase \u201clikely to remain  appropriate\u201d  in the statem ent if that\u2019 s the sense of the C ommittee?  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, there\u2019s \u2014there \u2019s a lot of, you know, pract ice and science and history , in terms of how much you put in the actual postmeeting statement as opposed to what we say in the  press conference statement.  It\u2019 s a\u2014you know, it \u2019s a judgment call.  You know, I \u2019m saying it now, so \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Thank you.  Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal .  You described the recent sl ide, Chair Powell, in inflation expectations as \u201cunwelcome. \u201d  You said that inflation expectations are \u201cvery important .\u201d  What, if anything, would the C ommittee be prepared to do to address this slide in inflation expectations if it continued?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are \u2014they\u2019 re quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflati on.  We need them to be anchored in a level \u2014at a level that \u2019s consistent with our symmetric 2  percent  inflation goal.   And we think that we need to conduct policy in a way that supports that outcome.  That\u2019s what we \u2019re doing now. We\u2019re also, as part of our  review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us \u2014that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent \u2014on a symmetric 2  percent  basis over time.  That\u2019s at the ve ry heart of what we \u2019re doing in the review.  It \u2019s too early to be announcing decisions.  We haven \u2019t made them yet .  But we \u2019re in the middle of thinking about ways that we can make that symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 2 percent  inflation.  And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent  inflation, and that is the \u2014that is the  thing that must happen for credibility in this area.  So we \u2019re committe d to doing that.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: How soon do you think that review mi ght be announced to the public?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we \u2019re in the middle \u2014we \u2019re really quite in the middle of it now, and my thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year.  These are\u2014you know, these changes to monetary policy frameworks happen \u2014they don\u2019 t happen really quickly, let \u2019s say.  Inflation targeting took many years to evolve.  I don\u2019 t think we \u2019ll take many years here.  I think we\u2019ll wrap it up around the middle of ne xt year , would be my guess.  I  have some confidence in that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Edward Lawrence of Fox Business.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking this.  So how big of a change, then, to monetary policy would there be if you get some of that uncertainty cleared up \u2014specifically , the phase -one China trade deal finished and  USMCA ratified?  How big of a change could that be to the monetary policy as it stands here, and could we see rate cuts next year \u2014or, rate hikes next year ?  I\u2019m sorry.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Rate hikes for next year \n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: Yes , because I \u2019ve heard the argument that t rade\u2019s causing the uncertainty.  U ncertainty is keeping the prices low.  I \u2019ve heard that argument from a F ed president from one of the D istricts.  So you remove that uncerta inty, prices, then, would naturally rise.  So could there be a point, or how \u2014I guess my question is , how big of an impact on monetary policy would removing that uncertainty  be\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yes.  So I would just say that a\u2014if we were  to have a sustained reduction in trade tensions \u2014broad reduction in trade tensions and a resolution of these uncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment , which is \u2014trade uncertainty \u2019s been weighing on business sentiment, in our judgment, in the judgment of many a nalysts.  And,   ultimately, it could affect activity.   I wouldn\u2019 t expect that the effects on activity or confidence would be immediate , or\u2014wo uld there  be immediate effects i n economic activity.  I think it would take some time after the recent things, but I do think it would be quite positive over time.  You come back to the question of raising rates .  So that \u2019s really about inflation .  And you know, we haven\u2019 t yet\u2014we just touched 2 percent  core i nflation , to pick one measure \u2014just touched it for a few months, and then we \u2019ve fallen back.  So I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that \u2019s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Brendan Greeley, the Financial Times .  The other thing you \u2019ve talked about in this review is the gains that a super high- pressure labor market have, particularly for the communities that you\u2019 re talking about.  You mentioned it just now whe n you were talking.   If that \u2019s something that you\u2019 re identifying , and that \u2019s something that the Fe d is learning more about this year, why not continue to push those gains, particularly for people who are reentering the labor force?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, I think we \u2019re doing that.  I mean, I think we \u2019re keeping\u2014I think we \u2019ve made very substantial adjustments to polic y over the course of this year , if you think about it.  We entered the year expecting some further rate increases, w e went  to \u201cpatient ,\u201d now we\u2019ve done three rate cuts.  It\u2019s a very substantial shift, and the effects of it will be felt over time.  So we feel like those shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you\u2019 re talking about, which are a continuing strong labor market, continued strong job creation\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: So if you were to d escribe the shifts that you \u2019ve made so far, it wasn \u2019t just about trade uncertainty.  It was about , specifically , these kinds of high- pressure labor gains that you\u2019 ve talked about.  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, no.  It was \u2014so we \u2019ve said it was about three things.  It \u2019s been about the slowing global economy.  You have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity around the globe.  It \u2019s been building for just about 18 months now, and that \u2019s having an effect on U.S. activity.  That \u2019s part of the weakness in manufacturing, export , and business investment.  We\u2019ve had trade policy uncertainty, which we think also has been weighing on activity and investment and sentiment.  And we \u2019ve had inflation, which\u2014we \u2019ve called  out the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent  as a risk that we needed to address.  So we \u2019ve been doing it to address all of those things. I would say,  the gains in the labor market have been great to see.  It \u2019s particularly the fact that people at the lower end of wages have been getting most of the benefit of most of the wage gains in the last couple of years.  That \u2019s a great thing.  You know from our Fed Listens  events that we \u2019ve been hearing from people who live and work in low - and moderate -income communities that this is the best labor market they \u2019ve seen in their lifetime , things like that . And, by the way, that there \u2019s also \u2014there \u2019s still so many people who are, you know, still not in the labor market yet,  and that \u2014there \u2019s just a lot more good that can be done there.  At the same time, we have to think about the whole economy, and\u2014but , yes, those gains are very positive.  We do call them out.  They are a reason for us to want to extend the expansion, and that\u2019s something we \u2019re committed to doing\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: On the Fed\u2019s balance sheet \u2014you all  recently resumed purchases of Treasury bills, and I was just wondering, how long do you expect that to continue ?  And, given the fact that, you know, the repo operations \u2014it seems like the F ed is having to increase the amount of liquidity\u2014 temporary liquidity that it \u2019s injecting into the system.  You know, do you   still feel like it\u2019 s just \u2014that there is not enough reserves in the system ?  Do you feel like you have a good sense of what \u2019s going on there?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Okay.  So, on the \u201c how long,\u201d  what we \u2019ve said is that we expect bill purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year.  And we \u2019ve said that temporary open market operations we expect to continue, I think, at least until the end of January, I believe.  Yes , through January.  In terms of the causes, so there \u2019s a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market participants and all kinds of analysts.  And, you know, one thing is that we t hink we need reserves to be back up to the level \u2014the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the various fluctuations that you see with reserves is something like $1.45 trillion or a little higher, and that \u2019s the level in early September.  So we \u2019re going to be adding reserves to get back to that place.  That \u2019s one thing.  There are also \u2014it may be \u2014one thing that was surprising about the episode was that liquidity didn \u2019t seem to flow as one might have expected.  We had surveyed the banks carefully about what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves, and many banks that were well above that level did not take that excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates.  They just \u2014they didn\u2019 t do tha t, and so the question is why.  A nd are there things that we can do that would \u2014adjustments that we could make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in the system without in any way sacrificing safety and so undness or financial stability?  So we \u2019re looking at those.  Those are not things that can happen that can really address the situation in the short term, but those are a range of things that we \u2019re looking at as well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the questions.  I wonder if you could give us a little more texture on, sort of , what the strongest or most   important case is for feeling that you\u2019 ve now taken out  adequate insurance.  Is it the response you\u2019re seeing in housing and other parts of the economy, arguably, to the cuts made so far?   Is it the fact that the risk environment out there globally has shifted a bit and abated a bit?   Or is it something different, you know, in the financial markets, the fact that the yield curve has righted  itself, et c etera?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Honestly, it \u2019s really the\u2014there isn \u2019t any one factor.   It\u2019s really the whole range of economic data and also what we see as\u2014about our stance of policy, which we believe is the appropriate stance.  It \u2019s really both of those things.  Again, if you look at the performance of the economy thr ough this, the consumer sector has  been quite resilient.  Witness today\u2019 s GDP report.  And it \u2019s just \u2014again, all the things I went through earlier suggest that that sector continues to be strong.  We know that the manufa cturing, investment , trade , export  sector has been weak.  That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we \u2019ve got an economy that is showing moderate growth, and we think that today\u2019 s setting \u2014we\u2019re now  at 1.5 to 1.75 percent .  That is, we believe, an accommodative level and a level that wi ll support that outlook that we  have\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: But are you concerned\u2014just to follow up , really .  This is kind of a one -legged recovery, that unless you get some impetus from other  things \u2014exports, investment \u2014tha t it\u2019s going t o weaken further at some point?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, we don\u2019 t see any evidence of that.  What we see is\u2014 what we see is that the consumer sector continues strong.  Agai n, low initial claims.  It\u2019 s all\u2014the data  we monit or, obviously, is a very broad range of data.  We also see now, I think, more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity.  You \u2019re seeing strong durable goods sales.

I think the effects are clear in what we think of as the interest- rate-sensitive sectors, which are the ones\u2014some of the ones that I mentioned.  I think it \u2019s\u2014I think interest rates are a factor in business investment, but I don\u2019 t believe they \u2019re the main factor and main driver .  And I think, you know, what one would like to see for \u2014to support greater manufacturing activity, business investment, and exports would be a global recovery .  And, you know, there \u2019s a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal  accommodation , maybe , in the global economy now.  Not here, but perhaps elsewhere.

In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years.  I would say this :  In the Beige B ook, we talk to educational institutions, health -care institutions, community groups, labor groups \u2014it\u2019s not just businesses.

We do financial stability .  We do bank regulation.  The U.S. economy faces significant longer -term challenges around potential growth, around labor force participation, around disparities of income and wealth, around all kinds of things .

Thank you\u2014t hank you, Chairman.  Wondering if you would categorize the current s tance of  monetary policy as accommodative, or if it \u2019s just, you know, that neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year.  Secondly, you know, we \u2019re now two years removed from the T ax Cuts and J obs A ct, and the economy is growing at about the same pace it was before \u20142 percent.  So, given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting long- term growth, you know, is it fair to say that the T ax Cuts and J obs A ct worked the way it was supposed to?

So if you look at where the federal funds rate is trading , it should be in the middle of , or maybe the lower half of , the range of 150 to 175.  So that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero.  I think my own sense would be that that\u2019s somewhat accommodative policy .  I would say, though, that there \u2019s a range of plausible estimates of what the neutral rate of interest is, and I think many of those who make such estimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years, and that process continues .  But, nonetheless, that seems to me to be very likely to be an accommodative stance of policy, and an appropriate stance , given the situation we \u2019re in with continuing downside risks and\u2014that I mentioned.  So\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Jean Yung from Market News.  I wanted to ask about financial stability risk s.  Recently, the IMF and some other global policymakers have been expressing   concerns over the high level of risky  corporate debt .  So as rates get lower in the U.S. and around the world, are you more worried about financial stability risk s and reach -for-yield?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time .  It\u2019s what we do since the financial crisis, as I \u2019ve mentioned before .  Currently, we don \u2019t see large imbalances.  This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the ones we \u2019ve seen certainly before the crisis happened . So we have a four -part framework, I \u2019ll quickly mention .  The first is leverage in the financial system , which  is low by historical standards .  The second is fundi ng risk, which is the risk of runnable funding, and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for, you know, the nonbanking financial sector .  If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices but not broadly across a range .  We don\u2019 t see bubbles and  that kind of thing.  And that leaves the fourth, which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector , and that \u2019s households and businesses .  So with households, again, we don\u2019 t see leverage.  We see them actually getting in very good shape financially in  the aggregate.  Obviously, plenty of households are not in great shape financially, but in the aggregate, the household sector  is in a very good place .  That leaves businesses, which is where the issue has been .  Leverage among corporations and other form s of business, private businesses, is historically high.  We \u2019ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps . So that\u2019s what I would say, but it \u2019s\u2014corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our framework, and it is something that we \u2019re pay ing quite a bit of attention to .  And it\u2019s been part of the last couple of S hared National C redit exams, and we\u2019 ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate action . \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Hi.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Have the pr oblems in the repo market led  you to  look into whether the liquidity and capital requirements for banks are too hi gh?  Is that something that the F ed mig ht review?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we \u2019re\u2014I think, again , I think the most important basic thing is to get the  level of reserves back up so that \u2014reserves move up and down with some volatility.  We don\u2019t want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September , which is, again, between $1.45 and $1.5 trillion .  That \u2019s the main thing, that \u2019s the first thing .  And we \u2019re on a path to do that , between our temporary open market operations and also our bill purchases . In addition to that \u2014in addition to that, we \u2019re looking at \u2014there are\u2014it \u2019s a big, complicated marketplace, and there was the\u2014one of the surprises, as I mentioned, was that banks that had told us that their lowest comfortable level of reserves was here.  They were well above that, and yet they didn\u2019 t deploy that liquidity when there seemed to be great opportunities to do that .  That didn\u2019 t happen.  So why is that?  And so, we \u2019re doing careful analysis of that . You ask, would we lower capital and liquidity requirements because of this ?  I don \u2019t think so.  I don \u2019t think that\u2019 s where this goes.  I think where it may go, though, is to look at, for  example, intraday liquidity, which used to be a common thing.  It used to be a common thing for banks to ha ve intraday liquidity from the F ed, what are called \u201cdaylight overdrafts .\u201d  That \u2019s something we can look at .  Also, there are just a few technical t hings that we can look at that would perhaps make the liquidity that we have \u2014which we think is ample in the financial system \u2014move more freely and be more liquid, if you will .

Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper .  Given this sustained level of low  inflation, even   in\u2014even in this country, do you think\u2014so the re seems to be a higher possibility that lower inflation expectation s will remain going forward.  So do you think a Japan -like situation , or \u201cJapanification \u201d of chronically low inflation and interest rates \u2014the U.S. is getting trapped by the  Japanification of this situation ?  Do you think so?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we \u2014we , of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now the situation in Europe, and we \u2014we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world.  And we don\u2019 t think we \u2019re exempt from those .  But, of course, if you look at our current inflation performance, it hasn\u2019 t been anything like what we \u2019ve seen in those other places.  But we don\u2019 t think \u2014again, we don\u2019 t think we \u2019re exempt from those pressures, and we are, therefore, st rongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is consistent with the symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective .  That\u2019s what we \u2019re committed to, and we\u2019ll use our tools to achieve .  So we take \u2014we take the risk very seriously. It\u2019s not \u2014the risk isn \u2019t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent.  The risk is that what we \u2019ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that  it\u2019s been very hard for them to get off .  Once inflation expectations start slidin g down, inflation moves down.  You have less \u2014interest rates move down as well , because there\u2019 s an inflation component in interest rates .  And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and really move inflation expectat ions up so that they\u2019 re squarely and firmly anchored at a level that \u2019s consistent with 2  percent  inflation \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.

Today, we have decided to lower interest rates for the third time this year to strengthen the U.S. economy in the face of global developments and provide insurance against ongoing risks, while our previous policy adjustments continue to provide meaningful support. We believe that monetary policy is currently in a good place.The economy is in its 11th year of expansion and the outlook remains favorable, with moderate growth and strong household spending supported by a healthy job market. However, business investment, exports, and manufacturing output have been weak due to sluggish growth abroad and trade developments.People in low- and middle-income communities are finding new job opportunities, highlighting the need to sustain economic expansion for those who have been left behind. Inflation remains below the target, but with a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, it is expected to rise to 2 percent.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has lowered its assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate due to various factors and muted inflation pressures. They have reduced the target rate for the federal funds rate multiple times and believe that the current stance of monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate as long as economic information remains consistent with their outlook.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to continue implementing monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime, controlling the federal funds rate primarily through administered rates rather than actively managing the supply of reserves. To maintain an appropriate level of reserve balances, the FOMC announced the purchase of Treasury bills and temporary open market operations, emphasizing that these actions are technical measures and do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.The speaker expresses gratitude and indicates their willingness to answer any questions.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Is the current stance of policy accommodative enough to sustain the expansion, and what kind of change in the economy would cause a reassessment?\n'ANSWER': The current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains consistent with our outlook. The economy has shown strong performance in the household sector, with low unemployment, job creation, wage growth, and consumer spending. The manufacturing sector and investment have been weaker. We see the outlook as more of the same, with risks potentially moving in a positive direction. If there is a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.", "'QUESTION': If the markets decide that you need to cut rates again, will you be forced to follow?\n'ANSWER': We will assess a range of data about the economy and risks to the outlook. Our outlook is for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective. Any significant changes to this outlook would cause us to reconsider our policy stance.", "'QUESTION': Are the risks to the outlook moving in a positive direction, specifically in terms of trade?\n'ANSWER': The risks that have been monitored include slowing global growth, trade policy developments, and muted inflation pressure. The potential phase-one agreement with China could reduce trade tensions and uncertainty, improving business confidence. The risk of a no-deal Brexit also seems to have declined. However, business investment remains weak, while consumer spending continues to drive growth.", "'QUESTION': Can you give a sense of how the Committee is thinking through the possibility of businesses cutting employment due to concerns about reduced investment?\n'ANSWER': We have been monitoring this risk, but we have not seen it yet. There is no evidence of rising layoffs or initial claims. We continue to see good job creation, declining unemployment, and a strong focus on the job market and rising incomes by consumers. The weakness in other areas has not affected the economy so far.", "'QUESTION': What would make the Federal Reserve decide it's appropriate to raise interest rates again?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve would raise interest rates if they see inflation moving up significantly, but currently they do not see that risk. Inflation has moved back up but seems to be settling below 2 percent, and inflation expectations have also decreased. The current stance of policy is appropriate as long as the outlook aligns with expectations.", "'QUESTION': What does the word \"appropriate\" mean in the context of the Committee's statement?\n'ANSWER': The current rate is likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information aligns with the positive outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation nearing 2 percent. However, if there are developments that significantly change this outlook, the Committee would respond accordingly.", "'QUESTION': Why isn't the phrase \"likely to remain appropriate\" in the statement if that's the sense of the Committee?\n'ANSWER': The decision of what to include in the postmeeting statement versus the press conference statement involves considering practice, science, and historical factors. It is a judgment call, and although it is not in the statement, I am saying it now during the press conference.", "'QUESTION': What would the Committee do to address the slide in inflation expectations if it continued?\n'ANSWER': Inflation expectations are crucial to our framework and achieving our 2 percent inflation goal. We are currently conducting policy to support this outcome and exploring potential changes to our framework. It is too early to announce decisions, but we are committed to using policy tools to achieve 2 percent inflation for credibility.", "'QUESTION': How soon do you think that review might be announced to the public?\n'ANSWER': We are currently in the middle of the review and I believe it will continue until the middle of next year. Changes to monetary policy frameworks take time, but I don't think it will take as long as inflation targeting did. My guess is that we will wrap it up around the middle of next year.", "'QUESTION': How big of a change to monetary policy would there be if the phase-one China trade deal is finished and USMCA is ratified? Could we see rate cuts or rate hikes next year?\n'ANSWER': Rate hikes are expected for next year.", "'QUESTION': How big of an impact on monetary policy would removing trade uncertainty have?\n'ANSWER': A sustained reduction in trade tensions and resolution of uncertainties would improve business sentiment and could ultimately affect economic activity. However, immediate effects on activity or confidence are not expected, and raising rates would only be considered if there is a significant and persistent increase in inflation.", "'QUESTION': Why not continue to push the gains of a super high-pressure labor market, especially for those reentering the labor force?\n'ANSWER': The Fed has already made significant adjustments to policy this year, including three rate cuts. These shifts are aimed at supporting a strong labor market and job creation, which will have long-term effects.", "'QUESTION': Can you describe the shifts that have been made so far, specifically regarding high-pressure labor gains?\n'ANSWER': The shifts made so far have been driven by three factors: the global economic slowdown, trade policy uncertainty, and the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent. While the gains in the labor market have been positive, particularly for lower-wage workers, there is still more work to be done. The goal is to extend the expansion and support the entire economy.", "'QUESTION': How long do you expect the Fed's purchases of Treasury bills to continue and do you still feel there is not enough reserves in the system?\n'ANSWER': The Fed expects bill purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year. Temporary open market operations are expected to continue through January. The Fed believes reserves need to be increased to reach the minimum level of $1.45 trillion. They are also investigating why liquidity did not flow as expected and exploring adjustments to improve liquidity without compromising safety and stability.", "'QUESTION': What is the strongest case for feeling that the Federal Reserve has taken out adequate insurance?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve believes that the strongest case for feeling that they have taken out adequate insurance is a combination of the range of economic data and their stance of policy. The consumer sector has been resilient, while the manufacturing, investment, trade, and export sectors have been weak. Overall, the economy is showing moderate growth and the current interest rate level is believed to be accommodative and supportive of the outlook.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that the recovery is one-legged and will weaken without support from exports and investment?\n'ANSWER': We don't see any evidence of that. The consumer sector remains strong, with low initial claims and strong durable goods sales. Housing is also contributing to growth, and monetary policy is supporting household spending and home buying by keeping the labor market strong and consumer confidence high.", "'QUESTION': Is there a concern that lower interest rates have less impact on business investment?\n'ANSWER': While interest rates do play a role in business investment, they are not the main driver. A global recovery, along with monetary and fiscal accommodation, would support greater manufacturing activity and business investment. Resolving trade issues would also contribute to global economic growth.", "QUESTION: Has the Fed considered institutionalizing Fed Listens and including input from community groups and other non-business entities?\n\nANSWER: Fed Listens has been successful and will likely be repeated. The monetary policy review may become institutionalized and conducted every few years. The Fed already engages with educational, healthcare, community, and labor groups, including representatives from low- and moderate-income communities, to ensure diverse perspectives are heard.", "'QUESTION': Do you believe that you have achieved a soft landing or are achieving a soft landing, in the sense that we're moving to trend growth for the rest of the year and next year?\n'ANSWER': Our outlook is for moderate growth of around 2 percent, which is pretty close to trend. We never say we've achieved it, but that's our outlook. Our current stance of policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain the rationale behind moving with a rate cut at this meeting instead of waiting until December?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell believes that this is the right move and there was a strong vote in favor of this action. He is confident that the actions taken this year have been beneficial for the economy and will continue to support economic growth in the future.", "'QUESTION': How does the regional disparities in the reaction to the China trade factor into your policy decisions?\n'ANSWER': Monetary policy is a blunt instrument and we cannot raise interest rates in some regions and lower them in others. However, we are aware of the rural-urban disparities in employment, growth, and health outcomes. While we may not have the tools to address these issues, we highlight them as important factors that may need to be addressed by legislatures at the national and state levels.", "'QUESTION': Are you asking Congress to take action now or in the future?\n'ANSWER': I'm not asking Congress to do anything right now. Our role is to focus on maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability, and bank regulation. Congress is responsible for addressing longer-term challenges such as potential growth, labor force participation, income and wealth disparities. Proper monetary policy alone is not enough, fiscal policy is needed for inclusive growth.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about developing monetary policy guidance that is dependent on the wins of the trade negotiations?\n'ANSWER': I wouldn't characterize it that way. I noted progress in the trade negotiations, but we are not assuming any specific outcome. The risk of a no-deal Brexit and the situation with China have both improved, but it is still uncertain what the ultimate results will be.", "'QUESTION': If the phase-one agreement doesn't work out, would we go back to making monetary policy?\n'ANSWER': That's just one factor among many that we consider when assessing the outlook. If there are significant changes that cause us to reassess the outlook, we would adjust our actions accordingly.", "'QUESTION': Do you see the union having a role to play in raising lower and middle incomes and promoting more shared growth in the long run?\n'ANSWER': The Fed does not determine labor arrangements. The General Motors strike likely reduced growth this quarter but is expected to recover next year. While it is good to see the strike settled, the Fed does not comment on appropriate labor arrangements as it is not within their task.", "'QUESTION': Would you categorize the current stance of monetary policy as accommodative or is neutral lower than expected?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Powell asks for clarification on the first question and requests it to be repeated.", "'QUESTION': Is the current policy accommodative?\n'ANSWER': Yes, the federal funds rate is trading in the lower half of the range, indicating a modestly below zero real rate. This suggests an accommodative policy stance, which is appropriate given the ongoing downside risks and the need to address the situation.", "'QUESTION': Are you more worried about financial stability risks and reach-for-yield given the high level of risky corporate debt?\n'ANSWER': We monitor financial stability risks carefully and currently don't see large imbalances. Leverage in the financial system is low, funding risk is also low, and while there are some high asset prices, we don't see bubbles. Leverage in the nonfinancial sector, particularly among corporations, is historically high and we are taking appropriate steps to address it.", "'QUESTION': Have the problems in the repo market led you to look into whether the liquidity and capital requirements for banks are too high? Is that something that the Fed might review?\n'ANSWER': The main focus is to increase the level of reserves in order to prevent them from falling below the September levels. The Fed is also analyzing why banks did not utilize their liquidity when there were opportunities. Lowering capital and liquidity requirements is unlikely, but the Fed may consider looking into intraday liquidity and other technical adjustments to enhance liquidity without compromising safety or stability.", "QUESTION: Do you think the US is at risk of experiencing chronically low inflation and interest rates similar to Japan?\n\nANSWER: While we acknowledge the global disinflationary pressures, we have not seen the same level of low inflation as Japan or Europe. However, we are committed to anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent and will use our tools to achieve this. The risk lies in inflation expectations sliding down, leading to lower inflation and interest rates. Our goal is to firmly anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': Is the Fed actively considering changing the composition of its balance sheet by removing agency mortgage-backed securities and replacing them with shorter-term Treasuries?\n'ANSWER': The Fed is aware of the issue but is not currently working on or making a decision regarding the longer-run maturity composition of the balance sheet. It is a significant question that will be addressed in the future, but not in the immediate future.", "'QUESTION': What is Chairman Powell's response to the President's tweet about the economy?\n'ANSWER': Chairman Powell declines to comment on the President's statement, as it is his practice to not comment on anything any elected official would say.", "'QUESTION': (No question provided)\n'ANSWER': The reporter thanks Chair Powell for his time and the conversation ends."]}
