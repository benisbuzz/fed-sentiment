"question_answer": [["\nREPORTER: Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.  I\u2019m wondering if you can walk us through expectations you have , specifically when it comes to the labor market going into 2023.  And I\u2019m curious about people who may have left the labor market, who have yet to come back, or who may face issues with childcare.  Perhaps they\u2019ve retired ea rly.  Any barriers that you see in keeping people from the labor market as you consider full employment going into 2023?  Thank you.  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Thank you.  So I would say, if you look at the labor market and you look at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it \u2019s clear , and I am confident , that we are on a path to a very strong labor market \u2014a labor market that , that  shows low unemploym ent, high participation, rising wages for people across the spectrum.  I mean, I think that \u2019s, that\u2019s  shown in our projections, it \u2019s shown in outside projections.  And if you look through the current time frame and think one and two years out, we \u2019re going to be looking at a very, very strong labor market.  In terms of exactly what that means, we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll  have to see how things evolve.  I think we learned during the course of the last very long expansion, the longest in our history, that labor supply during a long expansion can exceed expectations, can move above its estimated trend.  And, and I have no reason to think that that won\u2019t happen again.  At the same time, we have seen\u2014in terms of participation, we \u2019ve seen a significant number of, of people retire.  And so we , we don\u2019t actually know exactly what labor force participation will be as we go forward, but I, I would tend to, to look at it and think that it \u2014that it can return to high levels, although it may take some time to do that.  But overall, this is \u2014this is going to be, you know, a very strong labor market.  In terms of the near term, you ask as well \u2014so we see a couple of things, a few things that seem likely to be holding back labor supply.  There are very large amounts of job openings , and there are a very large number of people who, who are unemployed.  And the pace of, of filling those jobs is \u2014somehow feels slower than it might be.  So I \u2019d point to a number of things , the first of which is just that most of the , the act of sort of goi ng back to one \u2019s old job\u2014that \u2019s kind of already happened.  So this is a question of people finding a new job.  And that \u2019s just a process that takes longer.  There may be something of a speed limit on it.  You \u2019ve got to find a job   where , where  your skills m atch what , you know, what , what  the employer wants.  It \u2019s got to be in the right area.  There \u2019s just a lot that goes into the function of finding a job.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  sort of a natural thing.  In addition, I would say that we , we look at, for example, a , a significant number of people still say that they \u2019re concerned about going back to work in jobs where there \u2019s a lot of public facing because of\u2014because of COVID.  So that \u2019s clearly holding back some people, and that should diminish as vaccinations move  ahead.  There \u2019s also the question of childcare.  Many are engaged in, in caretaking.  And as schools reopen and, and, and childcare/daycare centers open in the fall \u2014in the fall,  then we should see \u2014we should see  that supporting labor force participation by caretakers.  Finally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or be diminished as we move through the summer and into, into, into the fall by the end of September , and I\u2019d lik e some \u2014that may also encourage some to go back in and take jobs.  So you would think that that would add to an increase in job creation as well.  So you put all those together, I would expect that we would see strong job creation building up over the summe r and going into\u2014going into the fall.  I will also say , though, the last thing I\u2019 ll say is , this is an extraordinarily unusual time.  And we , we really don\u2019t have a template or, or, you know, any experience of, of a situation like this.  And so I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data.  It \u2019s not a time to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of policy.  We need to see more data.  We need to be a little bit patient.  And I do think, though, that we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll  be seeing some things coming up in coming months that will \u2014that will inform our, our thinking.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chairman Powell.  Thanks for the question.  Your\u2014the Committee\u2019s median forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty, pretty tame outlook for the rest of the year.  As you know, the three -month annualized rate for the past three months was , I think, 8.4 percent  in the CPI.  And I\u2019m just wondering sort of how much longer we can sustain those , those  kinds of rates before you get nervous.  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few months.  But if you look behind the headline numbers, you\u2019ll see that the incoming data are , are consistent with the view that prices \u2014that prices  that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy.  So, for example, the experience with, with  lumber prices is , is illustrative of this.  The thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like, t hey should stop going up, and at some point , they, they, in some cases , should actually go down.  And we did see that in the case of lumber.  Another example where we haven \u2019t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation.  Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply.  It \u2019s going up at just an amazing annual rate.  But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop, and that in fact it would reverse over time.  So we think we \u2019ll be seeing some of that.  When wi ll we be seeing it?  We\u2019re not sure.  That narrative seems, still seems quite likely to prove correct, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the , the timing of that is , is pretty uncertain, and so are the , the effects in the ne ar term.  But over time, it seems   likely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be \u2014will be temporary.  And we \u2019ll be, you know, we\u2019re going to be  looking.  We\u2019ll be looking at the monthly pricing data.  I\u2019ll , I\u2019ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum -employment goal, but also for inflation.  And we \u2019ll be looking at that.  And , and as I \u2014as I mentioned, we expect and I expe ct that we\u2019ll see increases in supply over coming months as the factors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate, wane, move down.  So I , I can \u2019t give you an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down.  If you look at the \u2014if you look at the  forecast for 2021 and\u2014sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the , on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal.  And I think the fu ll range of, of, of inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent , which is consistent with our\u2014with our goals\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi.  Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this.  My que stion for you is that you mentioned that your colleagues did have a discussion about the progress that you\u2019re making toward your, your goals in order to consider tapering your asset purchases.  In that discussion, you said that you didn\u2019t \u2014haven \u2019t made substantial progress yet, but that you expect to continue to make progress.  In that discussion, did you guys talk about a timeline for when you expect to see that progress be made and when you migh t consider starting to reduce those purchases?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Right.  So I , I expect that we \u2019ll be able to say more about timing as we see more data.  Basically, there \u2019s not a lot of more light I can\u2014I can  shed on that.  But you can think of this meeting t hat we had as the \u201ctalking about talking about \u201d meeting, if you like.  And I now suggest that we retire that term, which has \u2014which has  served its purpose well, I   think.  So Committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in Dece mber, the economy has clearly made progress, although we are still a ways from our goal of substantial further progress.  Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective.  And assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting.  So at coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy \u2019s progress toward our goals, and we \u2019ll give advance notice before announcing any decision.  The timing, of course, Ylan, will depend on the pace of that progress and not on any calendar.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Right.  Thank you.  Well, you mentioned\u2014let me ask about inflation expectations.  You said they we re\u2014I think you mentioned in your opening statement that you saw them as within target.  Does that mean that some of the shorter-term measures we\u2019ve seen out there such as the New York Federal Reserve \u2019s three -year outlook, which jumped a bit\u2014should those sort of be dismissed?  And are we only looking at longer-term inflation expectations?  And would you describe those as still well anchored at this point?  And on a related note, would the F ed consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a monthly basis?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So we , we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations, because that \u2019s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation.  So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices.  So you\u2019ll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you\u2019ll see the shorter -term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up.  And , and that\u2019s, that\u2019s  maybe not a good signal for future inflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again.    So we\u2014ye s, I think if, if you look at the broad range of longer- term inflation expectations, they\u2019ve moved up.  They moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, you know, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been , where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard tim e stopping that process once it begins.  So that was a concern.  So it \u2019s, it\u2019s good, actually , to see inflation \u2014longer- term inflation expectations move back up to a range \u2014it\u2019s a range that \u2019s consistent with what our objectives are.  These are not precise me asures , and that\u2019s \u2014and they , they contain risk premiums of various kinds.  And that \u2019s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of economists, surveys of the public , and also market  based.  It \u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s a wide index, as I\u2019m sure you know.  We look at that, and we see them back in the range where they were.  And , by the way, they\u2019ve  been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago, at a time when inflation was , was, was still anchored at around 2 percent  or maybe even a little bit below.  So the answer is , yes, I think they are anchored and the y\u2019re at a good place right now.  It \u2019s gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows.  And, you know, as you know, it \u2019s, it\u2019s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to assure that inflation\u2014longer- term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal.  We , we think that \u2019s an important reason.  If, if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that \u2019s consistent with your goal, it \u2019s not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the  longer term.  So it\u2019s important.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Powell \u2014thanks, Chair Powell.  Your economic projections today forecast 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment at 4\u00bd percent , and core inflation of 3 percent .  If those conditions are achieved by the end of the year, would that constitute substantial further progress , in your mind?  And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort of median forecast for interest rates in 2023 showing not one but two interest rate increases at the time, I mean, is this kind of\u2014can you describe the sort of tone of the \u2014of the  discussion in the Committee?  And are we really moving towards sort of a post -pandemic stance?  Is there greater confidenc e that, you know, the recovery will be, you know, a full recovery sooner than expected?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at substantial further progress is one that the Committee will make.  And it would not be appropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not \u2014that do or do not  qualify.  That is \u2014that is , you know, the process that we \u2019re beginning now at the next meeting.  We will begin, meeting by meeting, to, to assess that progress and talk about  what we \u2014what we  think we\u2019re seeing and, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases.  In terms of the , the, the two hikes \u2014so let me say a couple things  first of all, not for the first time, about the \u2014about the  dot plot.  These are, of course, individual projections.  They\u2019re not a Committee forecast, they\u2019re not a plan.  And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year, because discussing liftoff now would be \u2014would be  highly premature, wouldn\u2019t make any sense.  If you look at the transcripts from five years ago, you\u2019ll see that sometimes people mention their rate path  in their interventions.  Often they don\u2019t.  And the last thing to say is, the dots are not a great forecaster of, of future rate   moves.  And that \u2019s not because \u2014it\u2019s just because it \u2019s so highly uncertain.  There is no great forecaster of, of future dots.  So , so dots to be taken with a \u2014with a big , big grain of salt.  However, so let me talk about this , this, this  meeting.  The Committee spelled out, as you know, in our FOMC statements the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the target range is made.  And it \u2019s outcome  based , it\u2019s not time based.  And , as I mentioned, it \u2019s labor market conditions consistent wi th maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent  and on track to exceed 2 percent .  In the projections, it gives some sense of how participants see the economy evolving in their most likely case.  And , honestly, the main message I would take away from the SEP is that participants \u2014many, many participants are more comfortable that the economic conditions in the Committee\u2019s forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously anticipated.  And that would be a welcome development.  If such outcomes materialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals.  So th e other thing I\u2019ll say is , rate increases are really not at all the focus of the Committee.  The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy.  But in terms of our tools, it \u2019s about asset purchases.  That \u2019s what we \u2019re thinking about.  Liftoff is, is well into the future.  The conditions for liftoff\u2014we \u2019re very far from maximum employment, for example.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s a consideration for the future.  So the near-term thing is really \u2014the real near -term discussion , discussion that will begin is really  about the , the path of asset purchases.  And , as I mentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, in future meetings , continue to think about our progress\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  Continuing\u2014Chair Powell, continuing in that vein, when you\u2019re ready, how will you go about signaling the start of tapering when you do decide to do that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So  our intention for this process is that it  will be orderly, methodical, and transparent.  And I can just tell you, we , we, we see real value in communicating well in advance what our thinking is.  And we \u2019ll try to be clear.  And , as I mentioned, we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll  give advance notice before announcing a decision to taper.  And so all I can say is that we , we think it\u2019s important \u2014we think where the balance sheet \u2019s concerned, a lot of notice, as much transparency as we can give , and as far \u2014as far  in advance as we can to give people a chance to adjust their  expectations.  And, you know, we expect to be in that business until we reach substantial further progress and then have a \u2014have a  decision.  Again, I have nothing further on time.  It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to say.  We\u2019re going to have to see more data.  We\u2019re a ways away from substantial further progress, we think.  But we \u2019re making progress.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZER.  So  you can\u2019t say generally how far in advance you would signal?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Again, as we \u2014as we approach that goal, we \u2019ll provide, you know, as much clarity as we can.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Craig Torres at Bloomberg.  If I were a businessman looking at the forecast today, I would ask how and when the F ed seeks to achieve an average of 2 percent  inflation.  In other words, does the FOMC have a look-back period?  Or does it plan to suppress inflation in outer years because , over the next three years , you\u2019re going to be above inflation?  So what is your look-back period?  Does t he Committee have one?  And if not, why not?  And if   they don\u2019t, why isn\u2019t this just flexible inflation targeting without an average in a range of 2 to 2\u00bc percent ?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, so as part of our year-and-a -half-long process, the review  that we did and came out with at the end of that with the \u2014with the  new S tatement on L onger-Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy, we looked  carefully at the idea.  We \u2019ve all read all the literature around different formulas for makeup and things like that.  And we concluded\u2014and, you know, I strongly agree \u2014that it\u2019s not wise to , to wed yourself to a particular formulation of that.  So we did adopt a discretionary\u2014there \u2019s an element of discretion in it.  You know, it says that we will seek  to\u2014seek  inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent  for some time.  And it\u2019s, it\u2019s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent  over time.  And that under the old\u2014under the  old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was , 2 percent  was a  ceiling because all of the errors were below.  You were always getting back to 2 percent .  So you were bouncing back and forth between 1\u00bd and 2, and we wanted them to be centered around 2.  So , so that\u2019s, that\u2019s  the approach that we \u2019re taking.  And you\u2019re right, it \u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s not  a formulaic approach.  We were clear on that when we announced the framework.  Was there another part of your question, Craig?\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks for taking my question.  So I wanted to ask you about the reverse repo usage that we \u2019ve seen lately.  I was curious if you are at all concerned about the level of money flowing into the reverse repo facility.  And do you believe that the changes in the Fed\u2019s rate control toolkit today will have any impact on that?  And then, in a related question, do   you think that F ed asset purchases are taking too many safe assets out of the market right now and creating maybe some dislocations in the money markets?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So on the \u2014on the  facility, we think it\u2019s doing its job.  We think it\u2019s doing\u2014the reverse repo facility is , is doing what it \u2019s supposed to do, which is to provide a floor under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its\u2014well within  its range.  So we \u2019re not concerned with it.  It\u2019s doing\u2014you have an unusual situation where the T reasury General A ccount is , is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking.  And so there \u2019s, there\u2019s  downward pressure \u2014we \u2019re buying assets \u2014there\u2019s downward pressure on short -term rates, and that facility is, is doing what we think it \u2019s supposed to do.  Sorry, your second question was again?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Yeah, I mean, the change in the rate control toolkit, will that have any impact on\u2014do you think that will reduce the , the amount of money coming into  reverse repos?  Will that have any impact on money market conditions that, you know, beyond the fed funds rate setting?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: It could have some impact.  I think we \u2019ll have to see empirically.   But it \u2019s designed to keep the federal funds rate, you know, within the range.  And I do think it could have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know, the very low rates and the downward pressures\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: And will it\u2014do think it will lower uptake on the reverse repo facility, or that \u2019s just not even really a focus of what the change was?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: It \u2019s not , honestly.  And , you know, the funny thing, you would think that it would, but we \u2019ll have to see.   It\u2019s, it\u2019s possible that that would not be the case.  That \u2019s going to be an empiric al question.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hey, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  I was wondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning and talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that, as you mentioned, is pretty roiled.  All the data is prett y\u2014has been pretty roiled by the pandemic, and we \u2019re not really sure where EPOP is going to settle in, we \u2019re not sure where participation is going to settle in.  And wages are already looking, you know, decent.  So I guess I wonder what full employment means in this context and , and sort of how you\u2019re thinking about those wage data.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yeah.   As, as  you well know, there isn\u2019t one indicator we can look to, and there \u2019s no one number that we can therefore point to.  We look at a range of indicators, and it \u2019s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly\u2014but , but, certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that.  So how do we think about it?  A couple of things.  We \u2019re all going to be informed by what we saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period of time.  Now, that hadn\u2019t happened in many other cycles , but this was a very long cycle.  So we\u2019re going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again.  It is  a different \u2014it\u2019s  a different economy.  We, we have had a slew of retirements , and that may weigh on participation.  That, that  effect, though, should wear off in a few years and, and, you know, as you move through that window , because they would have \u2014people would have retired anyway, and you\u2019 ll be back where you, you would have been.  So I think we \u2019re\u2014I think that  lesson number one is , is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment.  And I think if you\u2014during the last cycle, there were \u2014there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early,   you know, as , as 2012, when I arrived at the Fed.  And , you know \u2014you know, nine years later \u2014eight years later, we were still creating jobs.  And , you know, it was quite remarkable.  So we \u2019re all going to be informed by that.  At the same time, we understand this is a different economy.  You know, the , the demographics are , people are getting older, and that should have a secular effect of, of reducing participation over time.  So we have to be sensible about what , what  can be done.  But I think we \u2019re going to be \u2014we\u2019re going to lean into that and be optimistic.  You asked about  wages.   You know, we \u2019re seeing wage increases.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s  sort of a natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy.  And what we \u2019re seeing is \u2014we don\u2019t see anything that \u2019s troubling in the sense of\u2014what would be troubling would be, you know, very wide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation.  In other words, wages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage \u2013price cycle.  That\u2019s, that\u2019s  the old formula for\u2014one of the old formulas for having high inflation.  We don\u2019t see anything like that now.  We do see high wages.  We see them for , for people who are mostly new, you know, entering into n ew jobs, many of them in low -skilled jobs.  And, but we , we do think\u2014you\u2019ve got to\u2014you\u2019ve got to think in the labor market right now, where , where  supply and demand are just not matched up well.  And, you know, we think it \u2019s a flexible economy and, and it will clear.  There will \u2014there will be a level at which supply and demand meet.  And that\u2019ll\u2014we think that \u2019ll, that\u2019ll  be happening in coming months.  So\u2014but the last thing I \u2019ll say is, again, if you look at , at the forecasts, we  are going to be in a very st rong labor market pretty quickly here.  There are still a big group of unemployed people.  And , you know, we \u2019re not going to forget about them.  We \u2019re going\u2014we\u2019re going to do everything we can to get people back into work and give them the chance to work.  But there \u2019s   every reason to think that we \u2019ll be in a \u2014in a  labor market with very attractive numbers, with low unemployment, high participation, and rising wages across  the spectrum.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a little bit how we \u2019re looking at the \u2014at the labor market.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, I wanted to ask about the status of your thinking around the supplementary leverage ratio right now.  Is the Fed  still thinking about ways to permanently adjust this to account for the high growth in deposits?  And do you ultimately believe a permanent fix is needed?  And any information on the timing around that would be \u2014would be  helpful.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: What I can say is , we\u2019re working on it.  I don\u2019t have anything to share with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now, unfortunately.  But we \u2019ve, we\u2019ve  always \u2014our position has been for a long time and, and it is now that we\u2019d, we\u2019d like the leverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements.  When leverage requirements are, are, are  binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk ones.  It \u2019s a stra ightforward thing.  And because of the substantial increase in reserves, Treasuries , and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to be come \u2014ceasing to be  the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be.  So we do think it\u2019s appropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment, and, and we \u2019re looking hard at the issue.  We would also, just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or rec ommend do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements.  Sorry, I can\u2019t give you any more.  That\u2019s just something we\u2019re working on. \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi there.  Thanks for taking my question.  Chairman Powell, the price jumps we \u2019ve seen in some raw materials \u2014lumber, for example, you mentioned that earlier \u2014seem to be easing.  And it looks like we \u2019re at the beginning of suppliers catching up with demand.  But I wonder if you\u2019re worried at all, if we \u2019re going to end up with excess supply immediately after those shortages wear off and if we just continue this mismatch, as we \u2019re recovering and getting out of the pandemic economy.  A nd I wonder how that would affect the Fed\u2019s outlook at all.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, that is really not the problem we \u2019re having right now.  But \u2014and, actually, people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that, because they know that, you know, they don\u2019t want to build , build capacity and then find out that it \u2019s not necessary.  So , really, the problem now is , is that demand is very, very strong.  Incomes are high, people have money in their bank accounts.  Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn \u2019t\u2014it hasn\u2019t  come down.  We \u2019re seeing the service sector reopening.  And so you\u2019re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there.  But in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there , there  is a possibility on the other side of this tha t, that  inflation could be\u2014could actually be quite low going forward.  But that \u2019s not\u2014that\u2019s not  really where our focus is right now.  Our  focus right now is , we need to \u2014our, our expectation is that these , these  high inflation readings that we \u2019re seeing now will start to abate.  And that \u2019s, that\u2019s  what we think.  And it \u2019ll be like the lumber experience, and like we expect the used car experience to be.  With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the other two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there \u2019s no reason to think that they\u2019re going to keep going up   a lot.  Because if they are, people will build new hotels.  There \u2019s no reason for supply and dema nd to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time.  So we think that \u2019ll happen.  I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there \u2019s a lot of uncertainty.  The overall story is one that , that  we think is right, and we think the incoming data support it  and, you know, so do many, many forecasters.  And if you look at the forecasts on the FOMC, you will \u2014you will  see that as well.   But we don\u2019t \u2014we don\u2019t  in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that , that  this goes on longer than expected.  And the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations.  And if we see inflation expectations and inflation\u2014or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we \u2014what we  would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use our tools to address that.  Price stability is half of our mandate , and we would certainly do that.  We do not expect that , though.  That is not our base case.  And, and in that we\u2019re joined by many other forecasters, but there \u2019s a lot to be humble about among forecasters.  Forecasters have a lot to be humble about.  It \u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a highly uncertain business.  And we \u2019re, we\u2019re  very much attuned to the risks and, and watching the data carefully.  In the meantime, I would say, you know, we should\u2014as I mentioned earlier, there \u2019s so much uncertainty around this.  It \u2019s, it\u2019s just a unique situation that we need to see how things evolve in coming months and, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Howard Sc hneider, Reuters.  Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking this.  I don\u2019t want to miss  the moment here.  And I just \u2014I noticed that in the statement you dropped the language saying that the pandemic is weighing on the economy.  So is this the   effective end , in your view , of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though it\u2019s still cited as a risk?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, it \u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a continuum, right?  What you\u2019ve seen with the pandemic is sharply declining cases, hospitalizations , and deaths.  And that \u2019s great.  And , and, you know, that  should continue.  But , you know, you, you also saw in the United Kingdom, which has, I think, at least as high if not higher vaccination rates, they\u2019ve had an outbreak of the Delta variety.  And it \u2019s\u2014and it\u2019s  causing them to have to\u2014to have to react to that.  So you\u2019re not\u2014you\u2019re not  out of the woods at this point.  And it would be premature to\u2014in my thinking, it would be premature to declare victory.  Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels \u2014it would be good to see it get to a substantially higher level.  And , you know, that can only help.  So, look, I\u2014but you\u2019re right, the statement language is evolving.  I would expect it to continue to evolve.  There \u2019s a lot of judgment in that.  But you can expect us to drag our feet a little bit on that, because that \u2019s what you do with statement language.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s great to see the progress.  But , again, I would not declare victory yet.  I would say it is so great to see the reopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again.  You know, who doesn\u2019t want to  see that?  And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to continue to get vaccinated.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If I could follow up on that, if you\u2014if you view this statement in , in toto  and the \u2014and the  dots and the substance as well, do you think this is more a mark-to -market exercise around the improvement in health or around the inflation risks you see developing out there?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: I think it \u2019s both.  You know, I think, clearly, since March what \u2019s happened is , people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes, that they\u2019ll be   achieved.  Very strong outcomes in the economy will be achieved.  There \u2019s, there\u2019s  more grounds for comfort.  We \u2019ve seen growth coming higher than we expected.  We\u2019ve seen very strong labor demand.  We \u2019ve also seen \u2014we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think even though, you know, in, in our forecasters \u2019 case, they do see inflation coming back down over \u201922 and \u201923 into, into  areas that are very consistent with our\u2014with our mandate.  Nonetheless, the risk is , is something that can factor into people \u2019s thinking about appropriate monetary policy.  The thing is, you know, these are 18 different forecasts, and I can\u2019t stand here and say exactly what was in all 18 people \u2019s mind s.  But that , that  is something that I think can factor into things as well \u2014factor into our forecast as well.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell.  I, I want ed to ask a little bit more about inflation to make sure I understand how you\u2019re thinking about this.  So in the projections, inflation is expected to , to be high this year and then come back down next year and then maybe start to rise a little bit again, enough for a liftoff in 2023.  You know, I know that \u2019s obviously\u2014you know, take that with a grain of salt.  But that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation sustainably staying above 2 percent .  And so, I guess my question is, what would be causing that inflation?  What , what  would be \u2014because it seems like you all now see a situation in which inflation would be rising in a way that isn\u2019t caused by transitory factors in the \u2014in the  next couple of years.  So wou ld that be the result of a tight labor market?  Would that be because this whole situation has raised people \u2019s inflation expectations?  How are you thinking about that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So what we \u2019re seeing in the near term \u2014again, our base case is that what we \u2019re seeing in the near term is , is principally associated with , with  the reopening of the   economy and not with a tight labor market or tight resource constraints, really.  So \u2014but you\u2019re right .  When, when you get to\u2014 in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand sides of the economy adapt.  We have a very highly adapt ive, you know, flexible economy, more so than most.  And by 2023, those increases are really about, about, you know, rising resource utilization or, to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment, or high employment is a way to think about it.  So that \u2019s what that \u2019s about.  That\u2019s about the kind of broad inflationary pressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization across the whole economy and lifting, lifting  up inflation.  And that \u2019s why \u2014that\u2019s why you would see it then, because by then, you know, in the forecast \u2014and it \u2019s just a forecast , they\u2019re just individual forecasts.  In people \u2019s forecasts, that \u2019s what \u2019s happening.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: So the , the, the  change in the projections reflect the fact that you all are more optimistic about the economic outlook, and not necessarily that you think that this will change the way people think about inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: Yeah, I think\u2014there may be an element of the latter as well, because inflation expectations have continued to move up.  You know, it \u2019s all in people \u2019s individual thinking, and you can\u2019t \u2014it\u2019s hard to say.  It \u2019s not something the Committee debates in terms of, you know, what , what  the outlook is for 2023.  So I \u2019m, I\u2019m  a little bit speculating, which I shouldn\u2019t do.  But it w ouldn\u2019 t surprise me if there \u2019s an element for some people in, you know, seeing the inflation performance that we \u2019ve had  and thinking that I have more confidence that we could see inflation above 2 percent , that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought, and that inflation expectations may move up to a \u2014to a  level \u2014they were \u2014they were  really at a level that was kind of a little below 2 percent .  They might move up as a consequence of this or, or, or as a consequence of, of, of the new framework.  Yo u know, we did see inflation expectations moving   up in the \u2014in the  wake of the announcement of the framework.  But , you know, we don\u2019t really know that.  So, ultimately, I think it \u2019s consistent with both those things\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi .  Hi, thank you for taking my question.  Chair Powell, I\u2019m just looking at the forecast , and one thing I just don\u2019t think has been talked about all that much is how much you guys \u2014the Fed  thinks that the econom y is going to slow next year.  I mean, are we looking at a scenario of a slowing economy next year with higher inflation?  And , and what do you think about that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  We \u2019re looking at an economy that will not have the degree of, of fiscal support .  The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year.  So \u2014but you\u2019ve , you\u2019ve  still got a very strong growth, well above the longer-run potential output of the \u2014of the  economy.  You \u2019ve got \u2014you\u2019ve got  growth meaningfully above that, and inflation is lower next year in all of our\u2014in all of our forecasts .  I think the range of, of core  PCE forecast for next year is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and, and 2 to 2.3 in 2023.  So you\u2019re right, you\u2019re seeing \u2014I, I can\u2019t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s \u20143, 3\u00bd percent growth for next year.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s  a really good year\u2014coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, t hat\u2019s a really good year.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s  a year with a lot of momentum.  That\u2019ll see\u2014you know, that \u2019ll cause significant job creation and, and it will\u2014I mean, we would take 3\u00bd percent .  We didn\u2019 t have a 3\u00bd percent growth year\u2014w e didn\u2019 t have a 3  percent growth year between the G lobal F inancial Crisis and the end of the expansion.  So that would be a good year.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Doesn \u2019t it seem like there\u2019s a risk of, of, you know, like stagflation\u2014where that \u2014you\u2019re going to go from 7 percent and down, that means the economy\u2019s really, you know, dropping in some way.  We haven \u2019t seen that, right?  \n\nCHAIR POWELL: Well, the economy\u2019s not , not decel \u2014the economy is still growing, and growing at a , at a very healthy rate.  Our estimate\u2014I mean, different people have different estimates \u2014but , broadly speaking, economists think the economy has the potential to grow at around 2 percent  per year.  If you\u2019re growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be declining, people should be be ing pulled into the labor force, wages should be going up, lots of things should be happening, businesses should be investing.  So, you know, I guess to answer your question a different way, is there a risk that inflation will be higher than we think?  Yes.   As I said earlier, you know, we , we don\u2019t have any certainty about the timing or the extent of these effects from reopening.  And therefore we don\u2019t \u2014we don\u2019t  think that \u2014we think it \u2019s unlikely that they would materially affect the underlying inflation dynamics that the economy has had for a quarter of a century.  The underlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are aging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that , that  we think have, have, you know, really held down inflation.  All that\u2019s out there still.  You know, when we get through this, we may well \u2014we\u2019ll  be facing those same forces.  Nonetheless, is there a ri sk that inflation will remain higher than we \u2014than we thought?  Yes.  And if, if we see inflation moving above our goals in, in a time\u2014sorry, to an extent, to a level or, or persistently \u2014or persistently enough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tool s to address that.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Chair Powell, Brian Che ung, Yahoo Finance.  On that point, you talked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to productivity.  I noted that the median projection for r*, the longer-term interest rate, is still the same at 2.5  percent .  But there \u2019s been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis   could have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe changed productivity, in addition to combined with demographic changes that have already been in effect to suggest that that longer-term neutral rate or r* might be higher.  What would the implications of that be for monetary policy?   Do you think that maybe the Fed  could have the possibility of underestimating the long-run neutral rate?  And what might be the impact of that?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher by that amount.  And , and that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy, because it would give the Fed  more room to cut rates.  The problem with , with  interest rates being close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn\u2014for example, a pandemic.  And if you look, for example, at the European Central Bank, their, their policy rate was well below zero whe n, when the pandemic hit.  So we don\u2019t want to be in a place where we can \u2019t react.  A higher neutral rate would, would be \u2014from that narrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us.  It would give us more room and, therefore , then, that would tend to result  in better outcomes for the economy over time.  You know, we, it\u2019s\u2014you can\u2019t estimate it with great\u2014with great  precision.  I think we would be alert to\u2014I mean, studying r* is a\u2014is a  whole industry unto itself.  And I, I think we would be alert to factors t hat might raise r*, the neutral rate of interest.  And, you know, we , we try to keep up with that.  And I think we \u2019re, we\u2019re, we\u2019re  all thinking about that and the possibility of that.  You know, there are many\u2014there are a lot of stories right now that could \u2014that essentially could lead to higher productivity growth and higher r*.  We don\u2019 t know which of those stories will come true.  But , I mean, I\u2019ll give you an example.  It \u2019s just there are\u2014there are  a lot of start -ups, a lot of early-stage companies.  And is that going to have that effect?  We don\u2019t know.  But we \u2019ll be watching those things carefully.  \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Mr. Chairman, of c ourse you\u2019ll be shocked to learn that you have some critics on Wall Street.  And I would like to paraphrase a couple of their criticisms and get your reaction to them.  One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and do not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you\u2019re relying on the forecast that it will cool down in order to make policy.  I wanted to get your view on how you square that.  Another is that you have a long runway, you\u2019ve said, for tapering with announcements.  But if the data keep coming in faster than expected, are you trapped by fear of a taper tantrum from advancing the time period in which you announce a taper?  And , finally, you\u2019ve said the Fed  knows how to combat inflation, but raising rates also slows the economy.  And there \u2019s a concern that you might be sacrificing the economy if you wait too long and have to raise rates too quickly.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: So that \u2019s a\u2014that\u2019s a  few questions there.  So let me say , first, I think people misinterpret the framework.  I think the \u2014there \u2019s nothing wrong with the framework, a nd there \u2019s nothing in the framework that would in any way, you know, interfere with our ability to pursue our, our goals.  That \u2019s for starters.  All of our discussions and all of our thinking and planning are taking place in the context of our new framework.  We \u2019re strongly committed to it, we think it \u2019s well suited to our goals, including in this \u2014in this  unique time.  And I think if you look at the \u2014look at the  forecasts that we \u2019ve written down, you know, our Committee is solidly behind them.  The forecasts are all consistent with that.  You know, your specific question, I guess, was, will we be behind the curve?  And, you know, that \u2019s, that\u2019s  not the situation we\u2019re facing at all.  The situation that we, we  addressed in   our\u2014in our S tatement on L onger-Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy was a situation in which employment was at very high levels, but inflation was low.  And what we  said was, we wouldn\u2019t raise interest rates just because unemployment was low and employment was high if there was no evidence of inflation or other troubling imbalances.  So that \u2019s what we said.  That is not at all the current situation.   In the current si tuation, we have many millions of people who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target.  The question we face with this inflation has nothing to do with our framework.  It \u2019s a very different, very difficult version of a standard i nvestment \u2014sorry, a central banking question.  And that is, how do you separate in inflation\u2014how do you separate things that , that  follow from broad upward price pressures from things that really are a function of, of sort of idiosyncratic factors in a particular \u2014due to particular things?  I mean, a classic example was, to pick a narrow example, was the cellphone price war back in 2017.  If you remember, there was \u2014prices were incredibly low, and it held down core PCE by three -tenths or something for a year, and then it fell out.  So this is much bigger than that.  And , of course, it \u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s not  easy to tell in real time which is which, but that \u2019s, that\u2019s  the question you would face under, really , any framework.  And, you know, we \u2019re trying to sort that out.  I\u2019ve tried to, to explain that today about how we think about that.  And, you know, we do think that these are temporary factors, and that they\u2019ll wane.  We can\u2019t be absolutely certain about the timing of that, and we \u2019re prepared to use our tools as appropriate.  Your second one was?  Oh , you know, we will \u2014we will  taper when we feel that the economy has achieved substantial furthe r progress.  And we will communicate very carefully in advance on that.  And that \u2019s what we \u2019re doing.  That \u2019s what we \u2019re going to do, and, and we will follow through on that.  There \u2019s no \u2014I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction.    But, ultimately, when we achieve our macroeconomic goal, we will \u2014we will  taper as appropriate.  The third thing was \u2014what was the third thing?\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy.  And the history of the Fed  is that sometimes you go too far.\n\nCHAIR POWELL: That \u2019s right.  And we \u2014look, we have to balance the two \u2014the two  goals:  maximum employment and price stability.  Often they are\u2014they do pull in the sam e direction, of course.  But when we \u2014when we  raise interest rates to control inflation, there \u2019s no question that has an effect on activity.  And that \u2019s the channel \u2014one of the channels through which we get to inflation.  We don\u2019t think that we\u2019re in a situa tion like that right now.  We think that the economy is recovering from a deep hole \u2014an unusual hole , actually, because it \u2019s to do with, with  shutting down the economy.  It turns out it \u2019s a heck of a lot easier to create demand than it is to, you know, to bring supply back up to snuff.  That \u2019s happening all over the world.  There \u2019s no reason to think that that process will last indefinitely.  But  we\u2019re going, you know, we\u2019re going to watch carefully to make sure that , that  evolving inflation and our understanding of what \u2019s happening is , is, is  right.  And in the meantime, we \u2019ll conduct policy appropriately.\n", "neutral"]], "speech_counts": {"hawkish": 15, "dovish": 25, "neutral": 19}, "question_answer_counts": {"hawkish": 0, "dovish": 2, "neutral": 21}, "total_counts": {"hawkish": 15, "dovish": 27, "neutral": 40}, "speech_summary": "The Federal Reserve remains committed to achieving maximum employment and price stability by keeping interest rates near zero and maintaining asset purchases. The economy is showing signs of rapid growth, with indicators of economic activity and employment strengthening, household spending rising, and the housing sector and business investment remaining strong.Near-term supply constraints are impacting certain industries, but overall economic growth forecasts have been revised up. However, the recovery is still incomplete and risks to the economic outlook persist, with the labor market showing uneven improvement and the unemployment rate remaining elevated. Factors related to the pandemic are weighing on employment growth, but as vaccinations increase, employment gains are expected to accelerate. FOMC participants project further improvement in the labor market, with the unemployment rate projected to decline to 4.5 percent by the end of this year and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.The economic downturn has disproportionately affected those least able to handle it, particularly lower-wage workers in the service sector and African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation has increased notably in recent months, with the 12-month change in prices expected to remain elevated before moderating. However, there are concerns that inflation could be higher and more persistent than anticipated due to supply bottlenecks and constraints on supply adjustment as the economy reopens.The new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of well-anchored inflation expectations and indicates that indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have moved into a range consistent with the 2 percent inflation goal. The Fed remains prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy if inflation or longer-term inflation expectations deviate from their goal, while acknowledging that the pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects to maintain the current interest rate until labor market conditions improve and inflation reaches 2 percent. Economic projections suggest that these conditions may be met sooner than previously anticipated. However, the timing remains uncertain, and the focus will be on maintaining accommodative policy until the recovery is strong enough to no longer require near-zero interest rates.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a technical adjustment to the Federal Reserve's administered rates, increasing the IOER and overnight RRP rates by 5 basis points to maintain the federal funds rate within the target range and ensure smooth functioning in money markets. However, this adjustment does not impact the future path of the federal funds rate or the stance of monetary policy.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': Can you discuss your expectations for the labor market going into 2023 and any barriers that may prevent people from returning to the labor market?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell expects a strong labor market with low unemployment, high participation, and rising wages. Labor supply may exceed expectations, but the retirement of many workers and concerns about COVID-19 and childcare are potential barriers. Job creation is expected to increase as vaccinations progress, schools reopen, and unemployment insurance diminishes. However, the current situation is unprecedented, and more data is needed to fully understand the labor market.", "QUESTION: How long can the high inflation rates be sustained before causing concern?\n\nANSWER: The recent higher inflation rates are driven by categories directly affected by the pandemic recovery and economic reopening. Prices like lumber, which rose quickly due to shortages, are expected to stabilize or even decrease. The same is expected for used car prices, although the timing is uncertain. Inflation is likely to be temporary, and inflation projections for 2023 align with the Federal Open Market Committee's goals.", "'QUESTION': Did the FOMC discuss a timeline for tapering asset purchases?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC expects to provide more information on timing as they gather more data. The recent meeting was referred to as the \"talking about talking about\" meeting, and the term will no longer be used. While progress has been made, the Committee is still a ways from their goal. They will continue to assess progress and give advance notice before making any decisions, with timing dependent on progress rather than a set calendar.", "QUESTION: Does the Federal Reserve only consider longer-term inflation expectations and are they still well anchored at this point? Would the Fed consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a monthly basis?\n\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve primarily focuses on longer-term inflation expectations as they believe it is more relevant for inflation. Shorter-term measures can be influenced by factors like gasoline prices. The broad range of longer-term inflation expectations has moved up and is consistent with the Fed's objectives. Publishing the index of common inflation expectations on a monthly basis is not currently being considered.", "'QUESTION': Would achieving the economic projections for 2022 constitute substantial further progress, and is the Committee moving towards a post-pandemic stance?\n'ANSWER': The judgment of substantial further progress will be made by the Committee, and specific numbers are not laid out. The focus is on assessing progress meeting by meeting. The dot plot is not a plan or forecast, and discussing liftoff now would be premature. The Committee is more comfortable that economic conditions will be met sooner than expected, but rate increases are not the focus. The near-term discussion is about the path of asset purchases.", "'QUESTION': How will the Federal Reserve signal the start of tapering?\n'ANSWER': The Federal Reserve intends to make the tapering process orderly, methodical, and transparent. They see value in communicating their thinking well in advance and will provide advance notice before announcing a decision to taper. They aim to give as much transparency and notice as possible to allow people to adjust their expectations. The timing will depend on reaching substantial further progress, which is still a ways away.", "'QUESTION': So you can't say generally how far in advance you would signal?\n'ANSWER': As we approach our goal, we will provide as much clarity as possible.", "'QUESTION': If the FOMC has a look-back period for achieving an average of 2 percent inflation and why they don't have a flexible inflation targeting approach instead?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC does not have a specific look-back period and does not want to be tied to a particular formulation. They aim to seek inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time to create a sense of averaging 2 percent over time. The old framework had 2 percent as a ceiling, so they want to center it around 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned about the level of money flowing into the reverse repo facility and will the changes in the Fed's rate control toolkit impact it? Are Fed asset purchases taking too many safe assets out of the market and causing dislocations in the money markets?\n\n'ANSWER': The reverse repo facility is doing its job by providing a floor under money market rates and keeping the federal funds rate within its range. We are not concerned about it. The shrinking Treasury General Account and bill supply, along with our asset purchases, are putting downward pressure on short-term rates, but the facility is functioning as intended.", "'QUESTION': Will the change in the rate control toolkit reduce the amount of money coming into reverse repos and have an impact on money market conditions beyond the fed funds rate setting?\n'ANSWER': It could have some impact, but we will have to see empirically. The change is designed to keep the federal funds rate within the range, and it could also affect broader money market conditions due to the very low rates and downward pressures.", "'QUESTION': Will the change in the reverse repo facility lower uptake?\n'ANSWER': It's not a focus of the change and it's uncertain if it will lower uptake. It's an empirical question that remains to be seen.", "'QUESTION': How should we understand what full employment means in a world affected by the pandemic and uncertain about labor market indicators like EPOP and wages?\n'ANSWER': Full employment cannot be determined by a single indicator or number. The Federal Reserve considers a broad range of indicators including unemployment, participation, and wages. They will be cautious in assessing maximum employment, taking into account the lessons learned from the previous cycle. The aging population may impact participation, but the economy is expected to clear and reach a strong labor market with low unemployment, high participation, and rising wages.", "'QUESTION': What is the status of the Fed's thinking on the supplementary leverage ratio and is a permanent adjustment needed to account for high deposit growth?\n\n'ANSWER': The Fed is currently working on it and does not have specific details or timing to share. They believe the leverage ratio should be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements and are considering ways to adapt it to the high-reserves environment. They will ensure any changes do not weaken bank capital requirements.", "'QUESTION': Are you worried about excess supply and a mismatch between demand and supply as the economy recovers from the pandemic?\n'ANSWER': The current problem is strong demand, not excess supply. Prices are rising due to high demand and incomes, and the service sector is reopening. While there is a possibility of low inflation in the future, our focus is on the expectation that high inflation will start to decrease. We will address any persistent inflation above our goals.", "'QUESTION': Is the end of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity?\n'ANSWER': The pandemic is still a risk and it would be premature to declare victory. While there has been progress with declining cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, outbreaks like the Delta variant in the UK show that we are not out of the woods yet. Vaccination rates need to increase and statement language will continue to evolve.", "'QUESTION': Is the improvement in health or the development of inflation risks the main focus of the FOMC statement and projections?\n'ANSWER': It is both. Confidence in strong economic outcomes has increased since March, with higher-than-expected growth and strong labor demand. Although inflation is above target, it is expected to come back down in line with the mandate. However, the risk of inflation can influence monetary policy decisions.", "QUESTION: What would be causing inflation to sustainably stay above 2 percent, as projected in the near term and in 2023?\n\nANSWER: In the near term, the projected inflation is mainly associated with the reopening of the economy, not tight labor market or resource constraints. However, by 2023, the increases in inflation are expected to be driven by rising resource utilization and low unemployment resulting from a strong expansion and tightening of resource utilization across the whole economy.", "'QUESTION': Does the change in projections reflect increased optimism about the economic outlook and potential changes in inflation expectations?\n'ANSWER': The change in projections may reflect increased optimism about the economic outlook and the possibility that some individuals may have more confidence in seeing inflation above 2 percent. However, it is difficult to determine the exact impact on inflation expectations and it is not a topic of debate within the Committee.", "'QUESTION': Are we looking at a scenario of a slowing economy next year with higher inflation?\n'ANSWER': The economy is expected to slow next year due to reduced fiscal support, but it will still have strong growth above the longer-run potential output. Inflation is projected to be lower next year, with a range of 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and 2 to 2.3 in 2023. A 3\u00c2\u00bd percent growth year would be considered a good year with significant job creation.", "'QUESTION': Isn't there a risk of stagflation, where the economy drops and unemployment rises?\n'ANSWER': The economy is still growing at a healthy rate, and economists believe it has the potential to grow at around 2 percent per year. If the economy is growing above that, unemployment should be declining, wages should be increasing, and businesses should be investing. However, there is a risk of higher inflation, and if it exceeds our goals, we are prepared to use our tools to address it.", "QUESTION: What would be the implications of a higher long-run neutral rate (r*) for monetary policy and could the Fed be underestimating it?\n\nANSWER: A higher neutral rate would allow for higher interest rates, giving the Fed more room to cut rates in the event of a downturn. Currently, being close to the lower bound limits the Fed's ability to react to crises like the pandemic. While it is difficult to estimate the neutral rate precisely, the Fed is aware of factors that could raise it and is monitoring them closely.", "'QUESTION': How do you respond to criticisms that the new policy framework contradicts your reliance on forecasts and that waiting too long to raise rates could harm the economy?\n'ANSWER': The framework does not interfere with our ability to pursue our goals. Our discussions and planning are in line with the framework. The forecasts are consistent with it. We are not behind the curve. The current situation is different, with high unemployment and inflation above target. We are trying to differentiate between broad price pressures and idiosyncratic factors. We will taper when the economy achieves substantial progress and communicate in advance to avoid market reactions.", "'QUESTION': If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy. And the history of the Fed is that sometimes you go too far.\n'ANSWER': We have to balance the goals of maximum employment and price stability. Raising interest rates to control inflation does have an effect on activity, but we don't believe we are in that situation currently. We are closely monitoring inflation and will adjust policy accordingly."]}
