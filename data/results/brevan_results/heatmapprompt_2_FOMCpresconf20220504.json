[["\nREPORTER:  Nick Timira os, the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent in March is now essentially at the level that the Committee had expected would prevail over the next three years a nd at the bottom end of FOMC participants \u2019    projections for the longer -run rate that you submitted in the projection s at the last meeting.  How has your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March?   What does this imply for your inflation forecast?  And how has your level of confidence changed with regard to the feas ibility of slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Thank you.  So  you\u2019 re right \u20143.6 percent unemployment is just about as low as it \u2019s been in 50 years.  And I would say that I expect , and Committee members generall y expect , that we \u2019ll get some additional participation.  So people will be coming back into the labor force.  We \u2019ve seen that particularly among prime -age people.  And that will, of course , tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit.  I would also expect , though, that job creation will slow.  Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month in recent months \u2014very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy.  And so we think\u2014with fiscal policy less supportive , with mone tary policy less supportive , we think that job creation will slow as well.  So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further.  But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation.  Implications for inflation \u2014really , the wages matter a fair amount for companies, particularly in the service sector.  Wages are running high, the highest they\u2019 ve run in quite some time.  And they are one good example, or good illus tration , really , of how tight the labor market really is , the fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades.  And that \u2019s because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market.  So we think through our policies \u2014through fur ther healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example , of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in\u2014we \u2019d like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance  and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still    high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with 2 percent inflation.  That \u2019s our expectation.  Your third question was?\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Your level of confidence that you can slow hiring without pushing the economy into a downtur n\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I guess I would say it this way:   There\u2019 s a path.  There\u2019 s a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level.  The re\u2019re 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11.5 million vacancies, 6 million unemployed people.  So we haven \u2019t been in that place on the  vacancy,  sort of the vacancy /unemployed curve, the Beveridge curve.  We haven \u2019t been at that sort of level of a ratio in the modern era.  So , in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down a nd, as a result \u2014and they could come down fairly signif icantly a nd, I think, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are.  And that would give us a chance to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially.  So there \u2019s a path to that. Now, I would say, I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or outcome, if you will.  And I \u2019ll give you a couple of reasons for that.  One is , households and businesses are in very st rong financial shape.  You \u2019re looking at, you know, excess savings on balance sheets \u2014excess in the sense that they \u2019re substantially larger than the prior  trend.  Businesses are in good financial shape.  The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong.  And so it doesn\u2019 t seem to be anywhere close to a downturn.  T herefore, the economy is strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.  So, but I \u2019ll say , I do expect that this    will be very challenging;  it\u2019s not going to be easy.  And it may well depend, of course , on events that are not under our control.  But our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome , and that\u2019s what we \u2019re going to do\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Steve Liesman,  CNBC.   Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman.  You talked about using 50- basis -point rate hikes or the possibility of them in coming meetings.  Might there be something larger than 50?  Is 75  or a percentage point possible?  And perhaps you could wa lk us through your calibration.  Why one month should\u2014or one meeting should we expect a 50?  Why something bigger?  Why something smaller?   What is the reasoning for the level of the amount of tightening?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Sure.  So a 75- basis -point increase is not something the C ommittee is actively considering.  What we are doing is , we raised [the funds rate by] 50 basis points today.  And we \u2019ve said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are co nsistent with our expectations, there \u2019s a broad sense on the C ommittee that additional 50-basis -point  increases  should be on the table for the next couple of meetings.  So we \u2019re going to make those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we \u2019ll be paying close attention to the incoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions.  And , finally, of course, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they evolve.  So the test is really just as I laid it o ut\u2014economic and financial conditions evolving broadly in line with expectations.  And, you know, I think expectations are that we \u2019ll start to see inflation, you know, flattening out \u2014and not necessarily declining yet , but we \u2019ll see more evidence.  We\u2019ve seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak    or flattening out.  We\u2019 ll want to know more than just some evidence.  We \u2019ll want to really feel like we \u2019re making some progress there.  And we \u2019re going to make these decisions, and t here\u2019 ll be a lot more information.  I just think we want to see that information as we get there.  It\u2019s a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance.  There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world.  So, you know, we \u2019re leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision a s we get there.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  I\u2019m sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment rate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate toward a lower increase in the funds rate?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  I don \u2019t think the one month is \u2014no.  N o.  One month\u2019s  reading doesn\u2019 t tell us much.  You know, we \u2018d want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a direction that gives us more comfort.  As I said, we \u2019ve got two months now where core inflation is a little lower, but we \u2019re not looking at tha t as a reason to take some comfort.  You know, I think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled\u2014t hat inflation, in fact, is under control and starting to come down.  But , again, it \u2019s not like we would stop.  We would just go back to 25- basis -point increases.  It\u2019ll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive.  But , again, our expectation is, if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50 -basis -point increases on the table at the next two meetings\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  Colby Smith from the Financial Times.  Given the expectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed \u2019s target at year -end, what constitutes a neutral policy setting in terms of the fed funds rate?  And to what extent is it appropriate for policy to move beyond that level at some point this year?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So\u2014neutral.  When we talk about the neutral rate, we \u2019re really talking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down.  So it \u2019s a concept , really.  It\u2019s not something we can identify with any precision.  So we estimate it within broad bands of uncertainty.  And the current estimates on the Committee are sort of 2 to 3 percent .  And also, that \u2019s a longer -run estimate.  That\u2019s an estimate for an economy that \u2019s at full employment and 2 percent inflation.  So , really , what we \u2019re doing is , we\u2019re raising rates expeditiously to what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral.  But we know that there\u2019 s not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there.  So we \u2019re going to be looking at financial conditions, right ?  Our policy affects financial conditions , and financial conditions affect the economy.  So we \u2019re going to be looking at the effect of our policy moves on financial conditions.  Are they tightening appropriately?  And then we \u2019re going to be looking at the eff ects on the economy.  And we \u2019re going to be making a judgment about whether we \u2019ve done enough to get us on a path to restore price stability.  It \u2019s that.  So if that path happens to involve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral, then we will not hesitate to go to those levels.  We won \u2019t. But, again, there \u2019s a sort of false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers don\u2019t really feel.  You know, you\u2019 re going to raise rates, and you \u2019re going to be kind of inquiring how that is affecting th e economy through financial conditions.  And , of course, if higher rates are required , then we won \u2019t hesitate to deliver them.\n", "dovish"], ["\nREPORTER: Thanks , Chair Powell .  Neil  Irwin with Axios .  Do you see evidence that inflationary psychology is changing in areas like workers \u2019 wage demands, businesses \u2019    willingness to raise prices?  Do you see evidence that there is a psychological shift going on on inflation?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  We don \u2019t really see strong evidence of  that yet , but that does not in any way make us comfortable.   I think if you look at short -term inflation expectations, they \u2019re quite elevated.  And you can look at that and say, \u201cWell, that\u2019 s because people expect inflation to come down.\u201d   And , in fact, i nflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply.  Longer -term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to\u2014but only to levels where they were in 2014, by some measures.  So you can look at that.  And I think that\u2019s a fair description of the picture.  But it\u2019 s really about the risks.  We don \u2019t see a wage\u2013price spiral.  We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they \u2019re doing that, but there have been price shocks.  So I just think it takes you back to the basic point \u2014was that we know we need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal , neutral levels.  And we need to look around and keep going if we don \u2019t see that financial conditions have tightened adequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we \u2019re not where we need to be.  So , again, you don\u2019 t see those things yet , but I would say there \u2019s no basis for feeling comfortable about that.  It\u2019s a risk that we simply can \u2019t run.  We can \u2019t allow a wage\u2013pric e spiral to happen.  And we can \u2019t allow inflation expectations to become unanchored.  It \u2019s just something that we can \u2019t allow to happen, a nd so we \u2019ll look at it that way.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Great.  Thanks, Chair Powell .  Jeanna Smia lek with the New York Times.   You mentioned in the statement both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China.  Obviously, those are very much supply shocks rather than demand side.  And I wonder what you meant to convey by adding them \u2014I wonder what  you meant to convey by adding those .  \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well.  So our tools don\u2019 t really work on supply shocks.  Our tools work on demand.  And to the extent we can \u2019t affect , really , oil prices or other commodity prices or food prices and things like that, so we can \u2019t affect those.  But there \u2019s a job to do on demand.  And that \u2014you can see that in the labor market , where demand is substantially in excess of supply of workers.  And you can see it in the product markets as well.  But I guess I \u2019m just pointing out that \u2014a couple of things.  For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in China, they\u2019 re likely to , both, add to headline inflation.  And people are going to be suffering from that, you know.  People almost suffer more from food and energy shocks then, but \u2014even though they don\u2019 t actually tell us much about the future path.  So the second thing is that they\u2019 re both capable of preventing further progress in supply chains heal ing or even making supply chains temporarily worse.  So they\u2019 re going to weigh on the process of global supply chain healing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too.  So , in a way , they\u2019re two further negative shocks that have hit really in the la st, you know, 60 days, 90 days.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Hi.  Victoria Guid a from Politico .  I want to follow up on that, because you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play in inflation.  And I \u2019m just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of Russia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out , does getting back down to your 2 percent mandate require that the supply chain i ssues get resolved, since you can only handle the demand side, as you said?  Or will you have to crimp demand maybe even further if the supply chain issues don\u2019 t resolve themselves , in order to try and get inflation back down to where you want it to be?   \n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, you know, I \u2019ll just say :  For now, we \u2019re focused on doing the job we need to do on demand, and there \u2019s plenty to be done there.  Again, if you look at it, it\u2019 s essentially almost two to one , job vacancies to unemployed people.  There\u2019 s a lot of excess demand.  The re\u2019re more than 5 million more employed plus job openings than there are the size of the labor force.   So there \u2019s an imbalance there that we have to do our work on.  A very difficult situation \u2014you know, you would look at core infla tion, which wouldn\u2019 t include the commodity price shocks. And, you know, that \u2019s one of the reasons we would tend to focus on that, because we can have more of an effect on that, but it would be a very difficult situation.  I mean, we have to be sure that in flation expectations remain anchored.  And I mean, that \u2019s part of our job, too, so we \u2019d be watching that carefully.  And it puts any central bank in a very difficult situation.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Howard.  HOWARD S CHNEIDER.   Howard  Schneider  with Reuters .  And thanks, and nice to be back.  So two questions.  One quick one.  You \u2019ve cited the 1.9 to 1 figure s o often now, I \u2019ve got to ask you, what would be a good figure there?  What would you like to see that come down to to think that you\u2019 re in sort  of a noninflationary vacancy- to-unemployed rate?  And, secondly, on help from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market channels?   Equity markets broadly down quite a bit since late fall, first of the year \u2014how are you mapping that into household consumption?  Have they come down enough?  Do you need another leg down in equity values to think that households are going to stop spending at the rate we need them to stop spending?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Okay, so in terms of the vacanc ies-to-unemployment ratio, we don\u2019 t have a goal in mind.  There\u2019 s no specific number that we \u2019re saying , \u201cW e\u2019ve got to get to that.\u201d      It\u2019s really , you\u2019 ve got to get to a place where the labor market appears to be more in balance.  And that depends not only on the level of those things \u2014it also , it depends on how well the matching functions  in the labor markets are working.  Because, you know, the longer t hese expansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that, and the Beveridge  curve shifts out.  And that also tends to, you know, to help.  So there isn \u2019t a specific number.  I will say we were \u2014you know, I think, I think when we got to one -to-one in the, you know, in the late teens, we thought that was a pretty good number.  But , again, we\u2019 re not shooting for any particular number.  What we\u2019 d like to see is progress, but we \u2019re not really looking at that. That \u2019s an intermediate variable.  We \u2019re looking at wages , and we\u2019 re looking at , ultimately , inflation.  So, you know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works.  You can think of it as, you know, interest -sensitive spending, and then you can think of another big one as asset values broadly.  And , you know, the re\u2019re big models with, you know, a lot of different  channels that are related to that.  You know, we don\u2019 t focus on any one market \u2014the equity market or the housing market \u2014we focus on financial conditions broadly.  So we wouldn\u2019 t be targeting any one market , as you suggest , for going up or down or taking a view on whether it \u2019s at a good level or a bad level.  We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions \u2014all the different financial conditions inde xes, for example, which include equity.  But they also include debt and other , many other things \u2014credit spreads , things like that \u2014too\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER: Hi, Chair Powell .  Rachel Siegel here from t he Washington Post.  To follow up fr om your message from the very beginning, what is your message to the American people about when they will start to feel the effects of , say, a 50- basis -point rate hike or multiple    hikes?  How do you explain to them what that does to their grocery bill or t heir rent or their gas bill?  Thank you\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, first, the first thing to say is that we understand.  A nd some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation, and many aren \u2019t.  But it\u2019 s very unpleasant.  It\u2019s just something people don\u2019 t\u2014when they experience it for the first time, you\u2019 re paying more for the same thing.  If you \u2019re a normal economic person, then you probably don\u2019 t have that much extra to spend.  And it \u2019s immediately hitting you r spending on groceries , on, you know, on gasoline, on energy, and things like that.  So we understand the pain involved.  So how do you get out of that?  And it \u2019s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant , high nature doesn\u2019 t get entrenched in  the economy.  That \u2019s what we \u2019re here for , one of the main things we \u2019re here for \u2014perhaps the most fundamental thing we \u2019re here for.  And the way we do that is , we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down.  Now, the process of getting there involves higher rates \u2014so higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates, and things like that.  So it \u2019s not going to be pleasant either.  But in the end, everyone is bett er off.  Everyone \u2014 particularly people on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.  And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices.  We \u2019ll do it as quickly and effectively as we can.   We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in unemployment or, you know, a really sharp slowdown.  But , ultimately, we think about the medium and longer term, and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done \u2014the sooner , the better.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you, Chair Powell .

Are you concerned , with this high level of inflation , that the consumer will stop spending\u2014and what \u2019s the level of your concern\u2014 pushing us into a recession?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So the economy is doing fairly well.  W e expect growth to be solid this year.  And we see, y ou know, household spending and business investment as fairly strong\u2014and even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts.  So , and  the labor market \u2014if you look at the labor market , for people who are out of work and looking, there  are lots of job opportunities for \u2014wages are moving up and at rates that haven \u2019t been seen in quite a long time.

So it \u2019s a strong economy, and nothing about it suggests that it\u2019s close to , or vulnerable to, a recession.  Now, of course, given events around the world and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity.  Certainly , it will not be \u2014last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic .  As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent.  But most forecasters have growth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above 2 percent.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  But we \u2019ve talked with economists who have advised Democrat s and R epublican P residents who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on inflation that a recession is inevitable.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession \u2014without, you know, a severe downturn;  without materially high, higher unemployment.  And I mentioned the reasons for that.  So I see a strong economy now.  I see a very strong labor market , for example.  Businesses can \u2019t find t he people to hire \u2014they can \u2019t    find them.  So , typically , in a recession, you would have unemployment.  Now you have surplus demand.  So there should be room , in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting people out of work.  The issue will come that we don \u2019t have precision surgical tools.  We have, essentially , interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they \u2019re famously blunt tools.  They \u2019re not capable of surgical precision.  So I would agree.  No one thinks this will be easy, no one thinks it \u2019s straightforward, but there is certainly a plausible path to this, and I do think we \u2019ve got a good chance to do that.  And, you know, our job is not to  rate the chances \u2014it is to try to achieve it.  So that \u2019s what we \u2019re doing.  There are a range of opinions, though, and that\u2019s only appropriate.\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thanks .  Steve Dorsey, CBS.  You mentioned earlier , just now, fading fiscal policy.  Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from polici es at the White House and in Congress in combating inflation?\n\nCHAIR POWELL: You know, it \u2019s really the F ed that has responsibility for price stability.  And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity , we take it  as a given, and we don \u2019t evaluate it \u2014it\u2019 s not our job, really.  We don \u2019t have an oversight function there.  And we look at it as our job, given all the factors that are happening , to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability.   So if Congress or the A dministration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I \u2019m not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that.  It \u2019s not , it\u2019s really not  our role \u2014we need to stay in our lane and do our job.  When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know, give other people advice  [laughter] .  Right now , we need to focus on, just focus on doing our job.  And I \u2019ll stick to that.  Stick in our lane.   \n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg News.  A number of your colleagues have said that the rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to bring down inflation.  One, do you agree with that?  And , two, you\u2019 ve recently spoke n in great praise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the 1980s.  And while it \u2019s certainly not your desire \u2014the soft landing is the big hope of everyone \u2014would this FOMC have the courage to endure recession s to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So I think it \u2019s certainly possible that we \u2019ll need to move policy to levels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral.  We can \u2019t know that today.  That decision is not in front of us today.  If we do conclude that we need to do that, then we won \u2019t hesitate to do it.  I \u2019ll say again, the re\u2019s no bright line, you know, that you\u2019 re stepping over.  You\u2019re really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for  it.  You\u2019re looking at financial conditions and how that \u2019s affecting the economy and making a judgment.  Yo u know, we won\u2019 t be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than the other one.  It\u2019s much more about a practical application of our policy tools.  And we \u2019re absolutely prepared to do that.  It \u2014wouldn\u2019 t hesitate if that\u2019 s what i t takes . So I am, of course \u2014who isn \u2019t an admirer of Paul Volcker ?  I shouldn\u2019 t be singled out in this respect.  But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him.  And I \u2014But I  would phrase it this way:  He had the courage to do what he thought wa s the right thing.  That\u2019s what it was.  It wasn \u2019t a particular thing.  It was that he always did \u2014he always did \u2014what he thought was the right thing.  If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through.  So that\u2019s [what] the test is .  It isn\u2019t, will we do one particular thing?     I would say, we do see , though\u2014we see restoring price stability as absolutely essential for the country in coming years.  Without price stability , the economy doesn\u2019 t work for anybody, really.  And so it \u2019s really essential , particularly for the labor market.  If you think about it, like if you look at the last cycle, we had a very, very\u2014longest expansion cycle in our recorded history.  In the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to pe ople in the lower quartiles.  And it was, you know, racial , wealth , and income \u2014not wealth, but income gaps were coming down, wage gaps .  So it \u2019s a really great thing.  We\u2019 d all love to get back to that place.  But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability.  So , basically , we\u2019ve been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic.  T his isn \u2019t anything like regular business.  This is , we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know, in\u2014since the Depress ion.  Then we have this outsize d response from fiscal policy and monetary policy.  Then we have inflation .  Then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the commodity, you know, patch in half.  And now we have the se shutdowns in China.  So it \u2019s been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years.  So we have to look through that and look at the economy that \u2019s coming out the other side.  And we need to somehow find price stability out of this.  And it \u2019s obviously going to be very challenging, I think, because you do have, you know, numerous supply shocks, which are famously difficult to deal with.  So I guess that \u2019s how I think about it\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Mike Mc Kee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  The balance sheet \u2014why did you decide to wait until June 1st to begin letting securities roll off and not immediately start in the middle of this month , say?  And do you have another, a newer or a better , estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline?  And then, finally, I \u2019m just curious why you felt the need to address the American people at the top of your remarks?  Are you concerned about Fed credibility with the American people?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, why June 1?   It was just , pick a date, you know, and that happened to be the date that we picked.  It was \u2014nothing magic about it.  You know, it \u2019s not going to have any macroeconomic significance over time.  We just picked that.  Sometimes we publish these calendars on the first day of the month, and that \u2019s what we \u2019re doing.  I wouldn\u2019 t read anything into it.  In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stre ss how uncertain the effect    is of shrinking the balance sheet.  You know, we run these models \u2014and everyone does in this field\u2014and make estimates of  what will be , how do you measure, you know, a certain quantum of balance sheet shrinkage compared to quantit ative easing?  And, you know, these are very uncertain.  I really can \u2019t be any clearer.  There won \u2019t be any clearer  [estimates] .  You know, people estimate that , broadly, on the path we \u2019re on \u2014and this will be taken, probably, too seriously\u2014but sort of \u00bc percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace.  But I would just say, with very wide uncertainty bands \u2014very wide.  We don \u2019t really know .  There are other estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way.  And some of you may read about that.  That \u2019s kind of a mainstream estimate.   We know that it is part of returning to more normal , more neutral financial conditions.  And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have, you know, have the  interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy.  In terms of speaking to the American people , so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us , really , that that\u2019 s who we work for, and that it \u2019s inflation that people are feeling all over the country.  And it \u2019s very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are working hard on fixing it.  I thought it was quite important to do that.  And so that was really the thinking behind that\n", "neutral"], ["\nREPORTER:  Do you think the F ed has a credibility problem?\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  No, I don\u2019 t.  And a good example of why would be \u2014in the fourth quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year , you saw financial markets reacting , you know, very appropriately.  Not to bless any particular day\u2019s measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy.  I t\u2019s\u2014monetary policy is working through e xpectations now, to a very large extent.  We\u2019 ve only done two rate increases.  But if    you look at financial conditions , the two -year [rate] is at 280 [basis points] now.  In September, I think it was a t 20 basis points . And that \u2019s all through the economy.  People are feeling th ose higher  rates already.  And so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible.  And I think we want to keep it that way.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Scott Horsley.  [No response]  Okay.  Brian Ch eung. BRIAN CH EUNG.  H i there.  Brian Ch eung with Yahoo Finance.  To expand on Steve \u2019s question about Paul Volcker , there was also a great pain that came with that as well \u2014higher interest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses.  I\u2019m wondering how you kind of square what might be demand disruption.  Are you already seeing that ?  Is the idea here to incentivize a lack of spending, to decrease consumption, to perhaps table business investments ?  Is that essentially what\u2019 s happening thr ough this hiking cycle?  Thanks.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  Well, so , as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply.  And what you\u2019 re seeing as a result of that is prices going up and at unsustainable levels , levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation.  And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates :  it moves down.  Interest rates, you know \u2014businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less.  That \u2019s how it works.  But , ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in balance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about infla tion.  I mean, so, yes, there may be some pain associated with getting back to that.  But, you know, the big pain over time is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched.\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER:  Thank you.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch .  I was wondering if you could take a step back and talk about , in March the dot plot had, you know, looked  like steady quarter -point rate hikes, get the funds rate up to 2 percent at the end of the year.  Now\u2014where it seems like you \u2019re much more aggressive.  So could you talk about the thinking that \u2019s behind that?  Thank you.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  So, look, I think what you\u2019 ve seen is \u2014really, I would say, in the middle of last fall\u2014there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with what the data were saying.  If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports.  And inflation \u2014month by month, inflation had com e down till September, a few months in a row , stayed low.  And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that just said, no, this is a much stronger economy.  And by the way\u2014then , with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year.  But that hadn\u2019 t happened yet.  Anyway, we got an ECI reading\u2014e mployment compensation, [employment cost]  index reading\u2014 the Friday before the November meeting.  Then we got a really strong jobs report .  Then we got a really high CPI report.  And so I think it became clear to the C ommittee that we needed to adjust and adapt.  And we have.  Ever since then, really  ever since then , we\u2019ve been adapting.  We, you know \u2014the C ommittee moved by the time of the December meeting to a median [in participants\u2019 2022 projections] of three rate increases, then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting.   And that process is going on.  And it \u2019s clearly continuing.  And that \u2019s why I say\u2014and I actually mentioned this at the March meeting \u2014that no one should look at any single S EP as sort of a real resting place for 90 days, because we \u2019re in a fast -evolving situation.  And that \u2019s what \u2019s happened.  You can see\u2014unanimous vote today, of course .  And I told you the guidance \u2014that broad support on the    Committee to have 50- basis -point hikes on the table at the next couple of meetings.  So you\u2019 re right.  And by the way, other forecasters have bee n doing the same thing.  And it \u2019s just us adapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it\n", "hawkish"], ["\nREPORTER: ENZ ER.  Hi.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, I  want to ask how you\u2019 re able to balance your dual mandate\u2014stable prices and maximum employment \u2014especially when the unemployment rate for B lack workers is still roughly double , roughly twice the rate for white workers.\n\nCHAIR POWELL:  .  So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit.  So that \u2019s one thing I would say.  And that \u2019s important.  But the bigger point is this :  I do not , at this time, see the two sides of the mandate as in  tension.  I don \u2019t, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance.  You can see that there\u2019 s a labor shortage.  There aren \u2019t enough people to fill these job openings.  And companies can\u2019 t hire , and wa ges are moving up at levels that would not , over time, be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.  And , of course, everyone loves to see wages go up.  And it \u2019s a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level , because these wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation.  So , what that really means is, to get the kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans, especially the people in the lower -income part o f the distribution, especially them.   To do that , you\u2019 ve got to have price stability.  A nd we \u2019ve got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people\u2019 s wages aren \u2019t being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expa nsion, too.  That \u2019s\u2014the  good things you can have, as we have.  W e\u2019ve had\u2014several of the longest expansions in U .S. history have been in the last 40 years, and that \u2019s    because it \u2019s been a time of low inflation.   And long expansions are good for people and good for the labor market.  So that \u2019s the way I think about it.  I think we \u2014you know, our tools work.  We have to think in the , in the medium and longer term.  And I do think that the best thing for everyone is for us to get back to price stability to suppor t, really , a sustained period of strong labor market conditions.

As a result, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by \u00c2\u00bd percentage point and initiated the reduction of their balance sheet.After reviewing economic developments, the overall economic activity slightly declined in the first quarter, mainly due to fluctuations in inventories and net exports. However, household spending and business fixed investment continued to grow rapidly. The labor market remains strong and tight, with employment increasing by nearly 1.7 million jobs in the first three months of the year, and the unemployment rate reaching a post-pandemic low of 3.6 percent in March. Labor market conditions have improved for workers across different wage distributions and ethnicities, but labor supply remains subdued, leading to difficulties in filling job openings and an increase in wages at the fastest pace in years.Inflation is significantly above the target of 2 percent, with total PCE prices rising 6.6 percent and core PCE prices rising 5.2 percent over the past year. Strong aggregate demand, supply constraints, and disruptions have led to larger and longer-lasting disruptions to supply, spreading price pressures to a wider range of goods and services. The invasion of Ukraine and COVID-related lockdowns in China are expected to exacerbate supply chain disruptions and restrain economic activity abroad, creating spillovers to the U.S. economy.The Federal Reserve is committed to promoting maximum employment and stable prices, while being aware of the hardship high inflation can cause. They have raised the federal funds rate and plan to continue increasing it, as well as reducing the size of their balance sheet, in order to restore price stability. They anticipate further rate increases in the near future, but will make decisions based on incoming data and the economic outlook.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is focused on using their tools to bring inflation back to their 2 percent goal and has issued specific plans for reducing their securities holdings, including Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, in a predictable manner over time. They are prepared to adjust their approach in light of economic and financial developments, recognizing that the economy can often evolve in unexpected ways.Inflation has been unexpectedly high and there may be more surprises in the future, so we need to be flexible in responding to data and the outlook. We are committed to avoiding adding uncertainty during this challenging time and are closely monitoring inflation risks to restore price stability.\"The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\" \n\nSummary: The Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low until the labor market improves and inflation reaches and exceeds 2 percent. They will also continue to buy Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities until there is significant progress towards their employment and price stability goals.", "question_answer_summary": ["'QUESTION': How has the outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March? What does this imply for the inflation forecast? How has the level of confidence changed regarding slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession?\n\n'ANSWER': The unemployment rate is currently at 3.6%, which is as low as it has been in 50 years. While job creation has been strong, we expect it to slow due to less supportive fiscal and monetary policies. The additional supply of workers entering the labor force will also limit further declines in unemployment. Wage inflation is high due to a tight labor market, but we expect it to moderate as supply and demand come back into balance.", "'QUESTION': What is the level of confidence that the economy can slow hiring without causing a downturn?\n'ANSWER': There is a path to moderate demand in the labor market and reduce vacancies without increasing unemployment, given the high ratio of vacancies to unemployed individuals. The strong financial position of households and businesses, along with a robust labor market, suggests that the economy is well-equipped to handle tighter monetary policy. However, achieving this outcome will be challenging and may depend on external events.", "'QUESTION': Might there be a rate hike larger than 50 basis points? Why is the amount of tightening being calibrated?\n'ANSWER': The Committee is not actively considering a 75 basis point increase. They raised the funds rate by 50 basis points and expect additional 50 basis point increases in the next meetings. The decision will depend on economic and financial conditions, incoming data, and the evolving outlook. The goal is to see evidence of inflation flattening out and make decisions based on the available information.", "'QUESTION': If inflation is lower one month and the unemployment rate higher, would that lead to a lower increase in the funds rate?\n'ANSWER': No, one month's reading is not enough to make a decision. We would need to see evidence that inflation is consistently moving in a direction that gives us more confidence. Our expectation is to have 50-basis-point increases at the next two meetings if we see what we expect to see.", "'QUESTION': Given the expectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed's target at year-end, what constitutes a neutral policy setting in terms of the fed funds rate? And to what extent is it appropriate for policy to move beyond that level at some point this year?\n'ANSWER': The neutral rate is the rate that neither boosts nor slows down economic activity. It is estimated within broad bands of uncertainty, currently around 2 to 3 percent. We are raising rates expeditiously to plausible levels of neutral, but there is no precise threshold. We will assess the impact on financial conditions and the economy to determine if further rate increases are necessary.", "'QUESTION': Do you see evidence that inflationary psychology is changing in areas like workers' wage demands, businesses' willingness to raise prices?\n'ANSWER': We don't see strong evidence of that yet, but we are not comfortable with the current situation. Short-term inflation expectations are high, but longer-term expectations have come down. While companies have the ability to raise prices, there have been price shocks. We need to move our policy rate up to more normal levels and closely monitor financial conditions and the economy to prevent a wage-price spiral and unanchored inflation expectations.", "'QUESTION': What did you mean to convey by adding the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China in the statement?\n'ANSWER': Our tools don't work on supply shocks, they work on demand. We can't affect oil prices or other commodity prices. However, the situations in Ukraine and China are likely to add to headline inflation and can prevent further progress in supply chain healing, impacting broader inflation. These are negative shocks that have occurred recently.", "'QUESTION': Does getting back down to the 2 percent inflation mandate require resolving supply chain issues or potentially reducing demand further?\n'ANSWER': The focus is currently on addressing demand issues, as there is a significant imbalance with more job vacancies than unemployed people. However, if supply chain issues persist, it could create a challenging situation. The central bank must ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored, which adds to the difficulty of the situation.", "'QUESTION': What would be a good figure for the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio and how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market channels?\n'ANSWER': There is no specific goal for the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio. The focus is on achieving a more balanced labor market, considering the level of vacancies and unemployment as well as the efficiency of matching functions. The Federal Reserve does not target any specific market but looks at broad measures of financial conditions, including equity, debt, and credit spreads.", "'QUESTION': What is Chair Powell's message to the American people about the effects of a rate hike on their daily expenses?\n'ANSWER': Chair Powell acknowledges the pain of inflation and its immediate impact on expenses like groceries and gas bills. The goal is to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy, which requires getting supply and demand back in balance through higher rates. While the process may be unpleasant, stable prices benefit everyone in the long run.", "'QUESTION': Are you concerned that high inflation will cause consumers to stop spending and push the economy into a recession?\n'ANSWER': The economy is doing well, with solid growth expected this year. Household spending and business investment are strong, and the labor market is favorable with job opportunities and rising wages. While slower economic activity is possible due to global events and higher rates, a recession is not suggested. Growth is forecasted to be above 2 percent.", "'QUESTION': Are economists advising both Democrat and Republican Presidents saying that the Fed is behind on inflation and a recession is inevitable?\n\n'ANSWER': I believe there is a good chance to restore price stability without a recession or severe downturn. The strong economy and labor market indicate surplus demand, which can be reduced without causing unemployment. However, our tools are not precise, and while there are differing opinions, we are working towards achieving this goal.", "'QUESTION': Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from policies at the White House and in Congress in combating inflation?\n'ANSWER': The Fed takes fiscal activity as a given and doesn't evaluate it. Their role is to focus on sustaining maximum employment and price stability. While they encourage help with inflation, they won't make recommendations. Their priority is to focus on their job and get inflation under control.", "'QUESTION': Will the rates need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to bring down inflation, and would the FOMC have the courage to endure recessions to achieve this?\n'ANSWER': It is possible that policy may need to be moved to restrictive levels, but that decision is not currently being made. The FOMC is prepared to take necessary actions to bring down inflation, without arguing about different models of the neutral rate. Restoring price stability is seen as essential for the economy, particularly for the labor market. Dealing with the current inflationary shocks and finding price stability will be challenging.", "'QUESTION': Why did you decide to wait until June 1st to begin letting securities roll off and not immediately start in the middle of this month? Do you have a newer estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline? Why did you feel the need to address the American people at the top of your remarks? Are you concerned about Fed credibility with the American people?\n'ANSWER': We picked June 1st as the date to start letting securities roll off, there is no significance to it. The effect of shrinking the balance sheet is uncertain and estimates vary widely. Speaking to the American people is important to remind them that we are aware of inflation and are working to address it.", "'QUESTION': Do you think the Fed has a credibility problem?\n'ANSWER': No, I don't. The tightening of financial markets in response to our guidance and actions, as well as the increase in two-year rates, shows that our forward guidance is credible. We want to maintain this credibility.", "'QUESTION': Are higher interest rates meant to incentivize a decrease in spending and business investments?\n'ANSWER': Raising interest rates helps to moderate demand and bring it back in balance with supply. This leads to lower business investments and consumer spending. The goal is to achieve 2 percent inflation and maintain a stable economy, even though there may be some short-term pain involved.", "'QUESTION': Can you explain the change in the FOMC's thinking from steady quarter-point rate hikes to a more aggressive approach?\n'ANSWER': The FOMC adjusted its policy stance based on stronger economic data, including strong jobs reports and high CPI readings. The Committee has been adapting and adjusting its projections accordingly, with a median of three rate increases in December and seven increases in March. The situation is evolving rapidly, and the Committee is using its tools to address it.", "QUESTION: How does the Federal Reserve balance its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment, particularly when there is a significant disparity in unemployment rates between Black and white workers?\n\nANSWER: Unemployment rates for all racial groups have decreased and are closer to pre-pandemic levels. The labor market is currently out of balance, with a shortage of workers and rising wages that could lead to inflation. Achieving price stability is crucial to create a labor market that serves all Americans, especially those in lower-income brackets, and supports sustained strong labor market conditions."]}
