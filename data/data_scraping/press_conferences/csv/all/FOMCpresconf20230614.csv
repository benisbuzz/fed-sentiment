0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2,CHAIR POWELL,"We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
3,CHAIR POWELL,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.
4,CHAIR POWELL,"Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone."
5,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
6,CHAIR POWELL,"Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we’ve continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
10,CHAIR POWELL,"Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
11,CHAIR POWELL,And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
12,CHAIR POWELL,"The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Although growth in consumer spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
14,CHAIR POWELL,Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
15,CHAIR POWELL,"Committee participants generally expect subdued June 14, 2023 growth to continue."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL GDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate."
17,CHAIR POWELL,The labor market remains very tight.
18,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged a robust 283,000 jobs per month."
19,CHAIR POWELL,The unemployment rate moved up but remained low in May at 3.7 percent.
20,CHAIR POWELL,There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance.
21,CHAIR POWELL,"The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"Nominal wage growth has shown signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"While the jobs-to-workers gap has declined, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on inflation."
25,CHAIR POWELL,The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next year.
26,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation remains well above our longer-run 2 percent goal.
27,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE proces—prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in at 4 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI was 5.3 percent."
29,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.
30,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go."
31,CHAIR POWELL,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2025."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised in the SEP up to 3.9 percent this year."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation June 14, 2023 expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
34,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and price—and stable prices for the American people.
35,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
36,CHAIR POWELL,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
37,CHAIR POWELL,"As I noted earlier, since early last year, we’ve raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
41,CHAIR POWELL,The extent of these effects remains uncertain.
42,CHAIR POWELL,"In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5¼ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"As I noted earlier, nearly, nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year."
44,CHAIR POWELL,"But at this meeting, considering how far and how fast we’ve moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary June 14, 2023 policy."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"In our SEP, participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward."
47,CHAIR POWELL,"If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025."
48,CHAIR POWELL,"For the end of this year, the median projection is ½ percentage point higher than in our March projections."
49,CHAIR POWELL,"I hasten to add, as always, that these projections are not a Committee decision or plan."
50,CHAIR POWELL,"If the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
51,CHAIR POWELL,"We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks."
52,CHAIR POWELL,We remain committed to bringing inflation—bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
53,CHAIR POWELL,Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
54,CHAIR POWELL,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
55,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
56,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do at the Fed is in service to our public mission.
57,CHAIR POWELL,"June 14, 2023 We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
58,CHAIR POWELL,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL Thank you.
59,CHAIR POWELL,And I look forward to your questions.
60,MICHELLE SMITH,Colby.
61,COLBY SMITH,Thank you.
62,COLBY SMITH,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
63,COLBY SMITH,I’m curious what gives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated.
64,COLBY SMITH,"Interest rate–sensitive sectors like housing, while they’ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some regions, and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing."
65,CHAIR POWELL,"So, I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the beginning of this tightening cycle to address that."
66,CHAIR POWELL,"So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence—that of the speed of tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we’d need to keep policy restrictive."
67,CHAIR POWELL,"So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how fast to move rates up, and we moved very quickly by historical standards."
68,CHAIR POWELL,"Then last December, after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50—of a 50 basis point hike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings."
69,CHAIR POWELL,So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to our destination.
70,CHAIR POWELL,"So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold rates steady at this meeting, I would just say it’s a continuation of, of that process."
71,CHAIR POWELL,"The main issue that we’re focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time—so that the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it—we have come."
72,CHAIR POWELL,It may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace.
73,CHAIR POWELL,I want to stress one more thing—and that is that the Committee decision made today was only about this meeting.
74,CHAIR POWELL,"We didn’t make any decision about going forward, including what would happen at the next meeting, including—we did not decide or really discuss anything about going to an every-other-meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach."
75,CHAIR POWELL,We really were focused on what to do at this meeting.
76,COLBY SMITH,So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July—any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?
77,CHAIR POWELL,"So again, we didn’t—we didn’t make a decision about July."
78,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, of course, it, it came up in the—in the meeting from time to time."
79,CHAIR POWELL,"But really, the focus was, was on what to do today."
80,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say about, about July two things: (1) [the] decision hasn’t been made, (2) I do expect that it will be a “live” meeting."
81,MICHELLE SMITH,Howard.
82,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Thanks.
83,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
84,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"I was just wondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there’s been a level shift in the—in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower progress on inflation."
85,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"And I’m wondering in, in this sort of—where’s the disinflation coming from?"
86,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
87,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,The labor market’s going to be stronger it looks like—it’s not coming from there.
88,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,Demand’s not coming down all that fast.
89,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"According to GDP—you’ve doubled your, your estimate of GDP."
90,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,So what’s the—what’s the narrative here?
91,HOWARD SCHNEIDER,"It seems like it’s getting more “immaculate,” rather than more messy."
92,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’re, you’re right that the data came in, I would say, consistent with, but on the high side of, expectations."
93,CHAIR POWELL,"And if you go back to the old—the former SEP—the last SEP in March, you will see that [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved up."
94,CHAIR POWELL,"These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit."
95,CHAIR POWELL,Unemployment estimates moved down a bit.
96,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation estimates moved up a bit.
97,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, all three of those kind of point in the same direction—which is, you know, that perhaps more [monetary policy] restraint will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting."
98,CHAIR POWELL,"So although the level, frankly, is, is pretty—the level of 5.6 [percent] is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the [expected] federal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March."
99,CHAIR POWELL,So—but so we’ve kind of gone back to that.
100,CHAIR POWELL,"So your question is, where’s the—where’s the disinflation going to come from?"
101,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, you know, I don’t think the story has really changed."
102,CHAIR POWELL,We—the Committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting inflation down is going to be a gradual one.
103,CHAIR POWELL,It’s going to take some time.
104,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think you go back to the—to the three-part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation—which is, we think, as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward."
105,CHAIR POWELL,You start with goods.
106,CHAIR POWELL,"With goods, we need to see continued healing in supply conditions—supply-side conditions."
107,CHAIR POWELL,"They’ve definitely improved a substantial amount, but if you talk to people in business, they will say it’s not back to where it was."
108,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s one thing."
109,CHAIR POWELL,"And that should enable goods prices to continue—goods, goods inflation to continue to come down over time."
110,CHAIR POWELL,In terms of housing services inflation—that’s another big piece.
111,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and you are seeing there that new rents in new, new leases are, are coming in at low levels."
112,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s really a matter of time as that goes through the pipeline.
113,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will, will contain a big dose of—this year and June 14, 2023 next year—will contain a, a good amount of, of disinflation [coming] from that source."
114,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that’s, again, probably going to come slower than we would [previously have expected it to come into] effect."
115,CHAIR POWELL,"That leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half, pardon me, of the—of core PCE inflation that’s not housing services."
116,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we see only the earliest signs of disinflation there."
117,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a sector—it’s a very broad and diverse sector.
118,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say [that,] in a number of the parts of that sector, the largest cost would be wage cost."
119,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s the service sector, so it’s, it’s heavily labor intensive."
120,CHAIR POWELL,And I think many analysts would say that the key to getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions—which we have seen.
121,CHAIR POWELL,"We have actually seen, you know—I go through a number of indicators suggesting there has been some loosening in labor market conditions."
122,CHAIR POWELL,We need to see that continue.
123,CHAIR POWELL,"I would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation down are, are coming into place."
124,CHAIR POWELL,And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below trend.
125,CHAIR POWELL,It would be a labor market that’s loosening.
126,CHAIR POWELL,It would be goods pipelines getting healthier and healthier and that kind of thing.
127,CHAIR POWELL,"There, there—the things are in place that we need to see, but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time."
128,MICHELLE SMITH,Nick.
129,NICK TIMIRAOS,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
130,NICK TIMIRAOS,"Chair Powell, what’s the value in, in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now?"
131,NICK TIMIRAOS,"I mean, not to be flippant, but I don’t lose weight just by buying a gym membership—I have to actually go to the gym."
132,NICK TIMIRAOS,Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year-end ’23 rate today.
133,NICK TIMIRAOS,"A majority of you June 14, 2023 think you’re going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year."
134,NICK TIMIRAOS,So why not just rip off the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL Band-Aid and raise rates today?
135,CHAIR POWELL,"So the—first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate question from the question—from the—from, from that of level."
136,CHAIR POWELL,Okay.
137,CHAIR POWELL,"So—and I think if you look at the SEP, that is our estimate—our individual—it’s, it’s really a cumulation of our individual estimates of how far to go."
138,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I mentioned how, how we got to those numbers."
139,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of speed, it’s, it’s what I said at the beginning, which is, speed was very important last year."
140,CHAIR POWELL,"As we get closer and closer to the destination—and, according to the SEP, we’re not so far away from the destination, in most people’s accounting—it’s, it’s reasonable—it’s common sense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every meeting."
141,CHAIR POWELL,"And so the Committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if only slightly."
142,CHAIR POWELL,Then there are benefits to that.
143,CHAIR POWELL,So that gives us more information to make decisions.
144,CHAIR POWELL,We may try to make better decisions.
145,CHAIR POWELL,"I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as we—as we make our decisions going forward, and we’ll get to see, you know—we haven’t really—we don’t know the full extent of, of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we’ve seen."
146,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we—it would be early to see those, but we don’t know what the extent is."
147,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll have some more time to see that unfold.
148,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, it’s, it’s just the idea that we’re trying to get this right."
149,CHAIR POWELL,"And this is—if you think of the two things as separate variables, then I think—I think that the skip—I shouldn’t call it a skip—the, the decision makes sense."
150,NICK TIMIRAOS,I know you said July is live.
151,NICK TIMIRAOS,"With only one June employment—with only the June employment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July meeting—you get the ECI after, you get the Senior Loan Officer Survey after, you get some June 14, 2023 bank earnings at the end of next month—what incremental information will the Committee be Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL using to inform their judgment on whether this is, in fact, a skip or a, a longer pause?"
152,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I think you’re adding that to the, the data that we’ve seen since the last meeting, too."
153,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we—since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting, it’ll really be a three-month period of data that we can look at."
154,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think that’s a full quarter, and I think you can—you can draw more conclusions from that than you can from any six—any six-week period."
155,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll look at those things.
156,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll also look at the evolving risk picture.
157,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll look at what’s happening in the financial sector.
158,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and we’ll make a decision."
159,MICHELLE SMITH,Jeanna.
160,JEANNA SMIALEK,Thanks for taking our questions.
161,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Jeanna Smialek, New York Times."
162,JEANNA SMIALEK,"You obviously, in your forecasts, marked up the sort of path for growth, marked down the path for unemployment, and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably."
163,JEANNA SMIALEK,"I wonder, you know, since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy’s a lot more resilient and inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn?"
164,JEANNA SMIALEK,"And given that, you know, why do you feel confident that this is as high as you’re going to have to revise the federal funds rate?"
165,JEANNA SMIALEK,"Or do you think it’s possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this, this cycle?"
166,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I—I mean, on the first part, I just think we’re following the data and also the outlook."
167,CHAIR POWELL,"The economy is—the labor market, I think, has surprised many, if not all, analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience, really."
168,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s, it’s just remarkable."
169,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s really, if you think about it—that’s what’s driving it."
170,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s job June 14, 2023 creation."
171,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s wages moving up."
172,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s supporting spending, which in turn is supporting Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL hiring."
173,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s, it’s really the engine, it seems, that is—that is driving the economy."
174,CHAIR POWELL,"And so it’s, it’s really the, the data."
175,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of, you know—we, we always write down at these meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year."
176,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s how we do it."
177,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s based on our, our own individual assessments of what the most likely path of the economy is."
178,CHAIR POWELL,"It can be—it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher."
179,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, there’s really no way to know."
180,CHAIR POWELL,"But it’s—it is—it’s, it’s what people think as of today, and as the—as the data come in, it, it can move around during the intermeeting period."
181,CHAIR POWELL,It could wind up back in the same place.
182,CHAIR POWELL,But it really will be data driven.
183,CHAIR POWELL,I can’t—I can’t tell you that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the—where the federal funds rate will be that far in advance.
184,MICHELLE SMITH,Steve.
185,STEVE LIESMAN,"Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking my question."
186,STEVE LIESMAN,You had said back at the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance.
187,STEVE LIESMAN,"Is that still the case, or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there?"
188,STEVE LIESMAN,"And also, could you give us an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate?"
189,STEVE LIESMAN,"Is the—obviously, the current rate, according to the Committee, is not sufficiently restrictive."
190,STEVE LIESMAN,Is it 5.6?
191,STEVE LIESMAN,Is it 6?
192,STEVE LIESMAN,Where is sufficiently restrictive?
193,STEVE LIESMAN,Thank you.
194,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I, I would say again that I think that, over time, the balance of risks, as we move from very, you know—from interest rates that are effectively zero now to 5 percentage points with, with an SEP calling for additional hikes—I think we’ve moved much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate, and I think that means by—almost by definition that the—that the risks of, of sort of overdoing it and under, June 14, 2023 underdoing it are, are getting closer to being in balance."
195,CHAIR POWELL,"I still think, and my, my colleagues Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL agree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still."
196,CHAIR POWELL,So we don’t—we don’t think we’re there with inflation yet because we’re just looking at the data.
197,CHAIR POWELL,"And if you look at the—at the full range of, of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just—you just aren’t seeing a lot of progress over the last year."
198,CHAIR POWELL,"Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but, as you know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going."
199,CHAIR POWELL,"Sufficiently—so I think, you know, what, what we’d like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down."
200,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s what we want to see—of course that’s what we want to see."
201,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, I think it’s—it’s also—we understand that there are lags, but remember that it’s, it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening."
202,CHAIR POWELL,"I think it’s—I think the reason we’re, we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the tightening took place over last summer and later into the year."
203,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think it’s, it’s reasonable to think that some of that may come into effect."
204,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re, you know—I think stretching out into a more moderate pace is appropriate to, to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you know, more—with more data over time."
205,MICHELLE SMITH,Rachel.
206,RACHEL SIEGEL,"Hi, Chair Powell."
207,RACHEL SIEGEL,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
208,RACHEL SIEGEL,Thanks for taking our questions.
209,RACHEL SIEGEL,"I wanted to ask further on the lag effects—when you’re considering when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would expect to kick in as those lag effects come, come into effect that would inform your decisions?"
210,RACHEL SIEGEL,Have you learned things over the past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to expect those lags to come into effect?
211,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
212,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s a—it’s a challenging thing in, in economics."
213,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable lags."
214,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate hikes."
215,CHAIR POWELL,"So if you—if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting off—by the time we had lifted off, the two-year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of where [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points."
216,CHAIR POWELL,"So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where—where news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire."
217,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s different."
218,CHAIR POWELL,"But it’s still the case that what you see is interest-sensitive spending is affected very, very quickly—so housing, and durable goods, and things like that."
219,CHAIR POWELL,"But broader demand, and spending, and, and asset values, and things like that—they just take longer."
220,CHAIR POWELL,And you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on that.
221,CHAIR POWELL,So there’s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes.
222,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, then that makes it challenging, of course."
223,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re, we’re looking at the calendar."
224,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re, we’re looking at what’s happening in the economy."
225,CHAIR POWELL,We’re having to make these judgments.
226,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, it’s one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate pace now as we seek that, that ultimate—I can’t point to—that ultimate endpoint."
227,CHAIR POWELL,I can’t point to a specific data point.
228,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we’ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really flattening out reliably and then starting to soften."
229,CHAIR POWELL,I think we’ll know that we’re—that it’s working.
230,CHAIR POWELL,"And, ideally, by, by taking a little more time, we won’t go well past the level where we need to go."
231,RACHEL SIEGEL,I was curious if you could give us an update on what you’re seeing on credit tightening since the bank incidents for March and how you’re teasing that out apart from these lag effects.
232,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s, it’s too early still to, to try to assess the full extent of what that might mean."
233,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, that’s something we’re going to be watching, of course."
234,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, if we were to see what, what we would view as significant tightening beyond what would normally be expected because of, of this channel, then, you know, we would factor that into account on, on—in, in making rate decisions."
235,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s how we think about it."
236,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Chris.
237,CHRIS RUGABER,Thanks.
238,CHRIS RUGABER,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
239,CHRIS RUGABER,You mentioned that many of the trends are in place that you want to see—core services ex.
240,CHRIS RUGABER,housing has come in pretty low in the past couple of months.
241,CHRIS RUGABER,"And, as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation is now housing prices."
242,CHRIS RUGABER,And then we’ve had some quirks in used-car prices.
243,CHRIS RUGABER,"So given that these trends are in place, I guess I’m sort of asking the flip side of Nick’s question: Why signal additional rate hikes?"
244,CHRIS RUGABER,Aren’t things headed in the direction you need?
245,CHRIS RUGABER,Why not simply give it even more time?
246,CHRIS RUGABER,"Or—it’s surprising to see so much hawkishness in the dots, given what we’re seeing recently."
247,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
248,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, we’ve—remember, we’ve—we’re two and a half years into this—or two and a quarter years into this."
249,CHAIR POWELL,"And forecasters, including Fed forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and, you know, traditional—you know, typically forecasted that it would and been wrong."
250,CHAIR POWELL,So I think if you—I think if you look at the—at core PCE inflation overall—look at it over the last six months—you’re just not seeing a lot of progress.
251,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s running, and it’s running June 14, 2023 at a level, you know, over 4½ percent—far above our, our target and not really, you know, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL moving down."
252,CHAIR POWELL,We want to see it moving down decisively.
253,CHAIR POWELL,That’s all.
254,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re, you know, of course, we’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent over time."
255,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we don’t want to do—we, we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course."
256,CHAIR POWELL,"But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent, and we will."
257,CHAIR POWELL,And we just don’t see that yet.
258,CHAIR POWELL,"So, hence, you see today’s policy decision: both, both to write down further rate hikes by the end of this year but also to, you know, to take—to, to moderate somewhat the pace with which we’re moving."
259,CHRIS RUGABER,Quick follow-up.
260,CHRIS RUGABER,"I mean, the last press conference you mentioned you didn’t see wages driving inflation."
261,CHRIS RUGABER,"And, you know, there was some research from the San Francisco Fed suggesting wages aren’t necessarily a key driver."
262,CHRIS RUGABER,But you’ve talked about the labor market today and the need for softening.
263,CHRIS RUGABER,"Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point?"
264,CHRIS RUGABER,Thank you.
265,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
266,CHAIR POWELL,"So I’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper, but I, I would say that the—I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early 2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for—largely for goods."
267,CHAIR POWELL,People were still at home.
268,CHAIR POWELL,"They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on goods."
269,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent, supply chains got all snarled up."
270,CHAIR POWELL,So prices went way up.
271,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation went way up.
272,CHAIR POWELL,"So that was the, the origin, and it wasn’t really particularly about the labor market or wages."
273,CHAIR POWELL,"But as you—as you moved into—through ’21, into ’22, and now in ’23, I think many, many analysts believe that it will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing June 14, 2023 services sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent inflation."
274,CHAIR POWELL,We actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at a quite gradual pace.
275,CHAIR POWELL,"So—and that’s, you know, that’s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a few weeks ago, which is very consistent with, with what I, I would think."
276,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Michael McKee.
277,MICHAEL MCKEE,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
278,MICHAEL MCKEE,You said in the past that you don’t like to surprise markets.
279,MICHAEL MCKEE,It’s kind of been the Fed’s view markets should have an idea of what you’re going to do before you go in.
280,MICHAEL MCKEE,You also said a number of times that it would take a while to bring inflation down.
281,MICHAEL MCKEE,"You reiterated that again today and that we, we’d get to a point where inflation could be sticky."
282,MICHAEL MCKEE,"So I’m wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should look at your reaction function."
283,MICHAEL MCKEE,What will you be reacting to—time or data?
284,MICHAEL MCKEE,"In other words, if nothing much changes—if we’re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of inflation levels in July or in September or November—will you move because you’ve said you feel you need to?"
285,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Is it time that’s going to require additional movement, or would it be reversal in inflation?"
286,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, I don’t want to deal with, with hypotheticals about different ways data might move."
287,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, we, you know—we of course—we’re not—we don’t go out of our way to surprise markets or the public."
288,CHAIR POWELL,"At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting the policy right."
289,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s, that’s what we’re doing here, and that’s what we’ll do for the upcoming meetings."
290,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say the July meeting will be “live,” and we’ll just have to see."
291,CHAIR POWELL,"I think you’ll, you’ll see the data, you’ll hear Fed people talking about it, and, and markets will have to make a—make a judgment."
292,MICHAEL MCKEE,"Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement?"
293,MICHAEL MCKEE,Or are we going to be in a period where we’re not going to know what’s happening?
294,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I, I think if you look at—if, if you just look at—I’ll just point you to the forecast."
295,CHAIR POWELL,"So inflation is running—core PCE inflation is running at about 4½, a little higher than 4½ percent."
296,CHAIR POWELL,"And the, the median FOMC participant thinks it will go down to 3.9 on a 12-month basis."
297,CHAIR POWELL,This is by the end of this year.
298,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s expecting pretty substantial progress.
299,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s a pretty significant decline for half a year."
300,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s the forecast."
301,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’ll—we do try to be transparent in our reaction function."
302,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down."
303,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s the number-one thing.
304,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how I think about it.
305,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Victoria.
306,VICTORIA GUIDA,Victoria Guida with Politico.
307,VICTORIA GUIDA,Could you talk about the balance sheet and how you’re thinking about it?
308,VICTORIA GUIDA,"What, what are you looking for to judge whether we’re approaching reserve scarcity?"
309,VICTORIA GUIDA,And is Treasury issuance going to affect that?
310,VICTORIA GUIDA,"Also, are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?"
311,CHAIR POWELL,"So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it—if I can talk about that and then go back to the balance sheet."
312,CHAIR POWELL,"So on that—of course, we’ve been very focused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has."
313,CHAIR POWELL,[The] Treasury has laid out its borrowing plans publicly.
314,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we all saw—I saw the Secretary’s comments yesterday to the June 14, 2023 effect that [the] Treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL market disruption and that they’re going to watch carefully for that."
315,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, you know, the, the borrowings."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"At the Fed, we’ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills the, the TGA."
317,CHAIR POWELL,The adjustment process is very likely to involve both a reduction in the RRP facility and also in reserves.
318,CHAIR POWELL,It’s really hard to say at the—at the beginning of this which will be—which will be greater.
319,CHAIR POWELL,"We are starting at a very high level of reserves—and still elevated over RRP take-up, for that matter—so we don’t think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over the course of the year."
320,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s—that’s the—that’s the Treasury part of the answer."
321,CHAIR POWELL,"We will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we’re prepared to make adjustments to make sure that, that monetary policy transmission works."
322,CHAIR POWELL,Was there another part of your question?
323,VICTORIA GUIDA,Yeah—are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take some pressure off banks?
324,CHAIR POWELL,"So we, we have a number of—I would say the [ON] RRP [facility] doesn’t look like it’s, it’s pulling money out of—out of the banking system."
325,CHAIR POWELL,It’s actually been shrinking here lately.
326,CHAIR POWELL,"So I don’t think—that’s not something, something we’ve thought about a lot over time."
327,CHAIR POWELL,"It doesn’t really look like that’s, that’s something that we would do."
328,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s—I think it’s a tool that we have.
329,CHAIR POWELL,"If we want to use it, we can."
330,CHAIR POWELL,There are other tools we can—we can use to address money market issues.
331,CHAIR POWELL,But I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s likely that we would do in the near term.
332,MICHELLE SMITH,Jonnelle.
333,JONNELLE MARTE,Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.
334,JONNELLE MARTE,Have you seen sufficient cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down?
335,JONNELLE MARTE,"For example, how does the recent rebound affect your forecasts, and how does it factor into monetary policy?"
336,CHAIR POWELL,"So certainly housing—very interest sensitive, and it’s the first place, really, or one of the first places, that’s either helped by low rates or, or that is held back by, by higher rates."
337,CHAIR POWELL,And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year.
338,CHAIR POWELL,We now see housing putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.
339,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’re watching that situation carefully."
340,CHAIR POWELL,"I do think we—we will see rents, rents and, and house prices filtering into, into housing services inflation."
341,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, I don’t see them coming up quickly."
342,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I do see them kind of—kind of wandering around at a relatively low level now, and that’s appropriate."
343,JONNELLE MARTE,Do you think you’ll have to target that with further rate increases?
344,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I think we, we look at everything."
345,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t just look at housing.
346,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices all over the country, and they write down their forecast and—including their most likely forecasts—including their rate forecast."
347,CHAIR POWELL,"And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we cumulate it, and then we publish it for you."
348,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s how—that’s how they do that.
349,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I don’t know that housing is, is itself going to be driving the rates picture, but it’s part of it."
350,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Edward.
351,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman."
352,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.
353,EDWARD LAWRENCE,"So I want to go back to comments you made about, in the past, June 14, 2023 about unsustainable fiscal path."
354,EDWARD LAWRENCE,The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 10 years.
355,EDWARD LAWRENCE,The CBO also says that federal debt will be $52 trillion by 2033.
356,EDWARD LAWRENCE,At what point do you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility?
357,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Because—assuming monetary policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher-level spending.
358,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t do that.
359,CHAIR POWELL,That’s really not my job.
360,CHAIR POWELL,"We—we hope and expect that other policymakers will respect our independence on, on monetary policy."
361,CHAIR POWELL,"And we don’t see ourselves as, as, you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy."
362,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say, and many of my predecessors have said, that we’re on an unsustainable fiscal path and, and that needs to be addressed over time."
363,CHAIR POWELL,"But I think trying to get into, into that with lawmakers would be—would be kind of inappropriate, given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting."
364,EDWARD LAWRENCE,Is there any conversation then about the Federal Reserve financing some of that debt that we’re seeing coming down the pike?
365,CHAIR POWELL,No.
366,CHAIR POWELL,Under no circumstances.
367,MICHELLE SMITH,Courtenay.
368,COURTENAY BROWN,"Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell."
369,COURTENAY BROWN,"So looking at the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly—your forecast for GDP this year."
370,COURTENAY BROWN,"The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward."
371,COURTENAY BROWN,"And so should we take that as a sign that the Committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing—at least more—at least as it relates to what you were expecting in, in March?"
372,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I—I would just say it this way."
373,CHAIR POWELL,"I continue to think—and this really hasn’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we’ve June 14, 2023 seen in so many past instances."
374,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s possible."
375,CHAIR POWELL,"A—in a way, a strong labor market is—that, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that gradually cools could, could aid that along—it could aid that along."
376,CHAIR POWELL,"But I, I guess I want to come back to the, the main thing, which is, though, simply this."
377,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we see—the Committee—as you can see from the SEP, the Committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation down to 2 percent and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent over time."
378,CHAIR POWELL,That is our plan.
379,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we, we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the—in the U.S. economy is the thing that we cannot, cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today’s workers and families and businesses but also for the future."
380,CHAIR POWELL,"Getting price stability back and, and restored will benefit generations of people as long as it’s sustained."
381,CHAIR POWELL,And it really is the bedrock of the economy.
382,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and you should understand that that is our top priority."
383,COURTENAY BROWN,Just a quick follow-up on that.
384,COURTENAY BROWN,"I’m just a little confused because you said the Committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time, but when I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate is lower than where it is now."
385,COURTENAY BROWN,Can you help me understand that?
386,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
387,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, if you look two and three years out with, with the forecast—first of all, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they’re, they’re so highly uncertain."
388,CHAIR POWELL,"But what they’re showing is that as inflation comes down in the—in the forecast, if you don’t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually going up, right?"
389,CHAIR POWELL,"So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point—two years out, let’s say—should come down just to maintain real rates."
390,CHAIR POWELL,"And if—and actually, you know, since we’re, we’re probably going to—we’re, we’re having real rates that are going to have to be meaningfully positive and significantly."
391,CHAIR POWELL,"So for us to get inflation down, that probably means—that, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is June 14, 2023 coming down really significantly."
392,CHAIR POWELL,"And again, we’re talking about a couple of years out."
393,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL as, as anyone can see, not a single person on the Committee wrote down a rate cut this year, nor do I think it is at all likely to be appropriate, if you think about it."
394,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation has not really moved down.
395,CHAIR POWELL,It has—it has not so far reacted much to our—to our existing rate hikes.
396,CHAIR POWELL,And so we’re going have to keep at it.
397,MICHELLE SMITH,Julie.
398,JULIE CHABANAS,I’m sorry.
399,JULIE CHABANAS,Thank you.
400,JULIE CHABANAS,"Hi, Chair Powell."
401,JULIE CHABANAS,"Julie Chabanas, AFP News Agency."
402,JULIE CHABANAS,The May job report showed a rebound in May in the Black workers’ unemployment.
403,JULIE CHABANAS,Is it consistent with the Fed’s maximum-employment mandate?
404,JULIE CHABANAS,Are you worried about that—about this rebound?
405,CHAIR POWELL,"So we are, of course, worried about—there are—there are long-standing differences in racial and ethnic groups across, across our labor market."
406,CHAIR POWELL,That’s a factor that we don’t—we can’t really address with our tools.
407,CHAIR POWELL,"But we do consider that when we’re thinking about what constitutes maximum employment—it is, for us, a broad and inclusive goal."
408,CHAIR POWELL,And so we do watch that.
409,CHAIR POWELL,"But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment, has been bouncing around right near historic lows—historic modern lows here."
410,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re still talking about, I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we’ve seen in, you know, a half-century here in the United States."
411,CHAIR POWELL,"So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent is, is higher—three-tenths higher than it was measured to be at the last—a month ago."
412,CHAIR POWELL,"But, still, it’s extraordinarily low."
413,CHAIR POWELL,"And so it’s a very, very tight labor market."
414,MICHELLE SMITH,Megan.
415,MEGAN CASSELLA,Thank you.
416,MEGAN CASSELLA,I want to follow up first a little bit just on the rent question on housing.
417,MEGAN CASSELLA,We heard Governor Waller talk about how—I’ll back up.
418,MEGAN CASSELLA,"We haven’t June 14, 2023 quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet."
419,MEGAN CASSELLA,And we did hear Governor Waller talk Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL about how an uptick in housing might mean that there’s not going to be as much relief coming or a shorter bit of relief than we thought.
420,MEGAN CASSELLA,Can you talk about how you’re thinking about that and how that played into today’s outcome?
421,CHAIR POWELL,"I wouldn’t say—that’s, you know—as a factual matter, that’s correct."
422,CHAIR POWELL,"We do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their increases because we want—we want the, you know, we want inflation to come down."
423,CHAIR POWELL,"And rental is, is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the PCE."
424,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s important.
425,CHAIR POWELL,And so we’re—it’s something that we’re watching very carefully.
426,CHAIR POWELL,It’s part of the overall picture.
427,CHAIR POWELL,"I wouldn’t say it’s the decisive part, but take a step back."
428,CHAIR POWELL,"What you see is—look at—look at core inflation over the past six months, a year."
429,CHAIR POWELL,You’re just not seeing a lot of progress—not the kind of progress we want to see.
430,CHAIR POWELL,"And that, that’s—it’s hard to avoid that."
431,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, the Committee—people on the Committee—the median went up significantly, so that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on a 12-month basis will be 3.9 percent this year."
432,CHAIR POWELL,"So, once again, every year for the past three years, it’s gone up over the course of the year, and that’s doing that again."
433,CHAIR POWELL,"So we see that, and we see that inflation forecasts are coming in low again, and we see that—that that tells us that we need to do more."
434,CHAIR POWELL,And so we’re—that’s why you see the SEP with—where it is.
435,MEGAN CASSELLA,"Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and, given the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think wages might need to fall in order to get inflation back in line?"
436,CHAIR POWELL,So wages will continue to increase.
437,CHAIR POWELL,"So we, we, you know—what we’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that’s June 14, 2023 consistent with 2 percent inflation over time."
438,CHAIR POWELL,"And so I, I think we’ve seen some progress—all, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL all of the major measures of wages have, have moved down from extremely elevated—not extremely elevated—highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they’re, they’re moving back down but, but quite gradually."
439,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and, you know, we want to see that, that process continue gradually."
440,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, it’s great to see wage increases, particularly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum."
441,CHAIR POWELL,"But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which benefits everyone."
442,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone else."
443,CHAIR POWELL,"People on a fixed income are hurt the worst, and the fastest, by high inflation."
444,MICHELLE SMITH,Greg.
445,GREG ROBB,"Thank you so much, Chair Powell."
446,GREG ROBB,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
447,GREG ROBB,"I just wondered if the Committee has talked at all about the labor market and, and—there, there’s strikes now in Hollywood and now the United Autoworkers are talking about a possible strike."
448,GREG ROBB,"I mean, aren’t workers—they have—we have some—workers have power now and are going to be seeking higher wages."
449,GREG ROBB,Does that come up in your discussions?
450,GREG ROBB,Thanks.
451,CHAIR POWELL,"So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor market could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as, as anything."
452,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, it’s, it’s very—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central."
453,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it’s half of our mandate."
454,CHAIR POWELL,So we spend a lot of time talking about that.
455,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, you know, we—there, there are structural issues that are really not for the Fed."
456,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we don’t spend a lot of time— although we take notice of, of what’s going on, but we’re not, you know—we’re not involved in discussions or debates over, over strikes and things like that."
457,CHAIR POWELL,"But we—you know, we, we look, and we see what’s going on."
458,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’re making judgments about what it will take to get inflation down to 2 percent in the aggregate."
459,CHAIR POWELL,"And as I said, don’t think that was about—I June 14, 2023 didn’t—most folks would say now it wasn’t really about that—about wages at the beginning."
460,CHAIR POWELL,"Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And it’s becoming more about that as we—as we get into really service-sector inflation, which is the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress."
461,MICHELLE SMITH,Let’s go to Mark for the last question.
462,MARK HAMRICK,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
463,MARK HAMRICK,Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.
464,MARK HAMRICK,Wondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk now that we’re about three months past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.
465,MARK HAMRICK,"And also, specifically, what are the risks associated with commercial real estate as well as nonbank financials?"
466,MARK HAMRICK,"And could you further elevate those risks with higher still rates, possibly for longer?"
467,CHAIR POWELL,So I’m trying to think where to start.
468,CHAIR POWELL,I’ll start with commercial real estate.
469,CHAIR POWELL,"We—of course, we’re watching that situation very carefully."
470,CHAIR POWELL,There’s a substantial amount of commercial real estate in the banking system.
471,CHAIR POWELL,"A, a large part of it is in smaller banks."
472,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s well distributed—to the extent it’s well distributedthen, then the system could, could take losses."
473,CHAIR POWELL,"We do expect that there will be losses, but they’ll be—they’ll be banks that have concentrations, and those banks will experience larger losses."
474,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re well aware of that.
475,CHAIR POWELL,We’re monitoring it carefully.
476,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it feels like—it feels like something that will be around for some time, as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you know, work its way into systemic risk."
477,CHAIR POWELL,In terms of nonbank financials—financial sector—there’s been a ton of work.
478,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, clearly in the—in the pandemic, it really was—it was the nonbank financial sector where, where issues really arose."
479,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, there’s a lot of work going on in—with the Administration, in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and, and in all kinds of areas in the nonbank financial market."
480,CHAIR POWELL,"And—but, you know, our jurisdiction at June 14, 2023 the Fed is over banks—actually bank holding companies and some banks."
481,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s really Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL our main focus."
482,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully monitoring that situation."
483,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, our, our job generally involves worrying about a lot of things that may go wrong, and that would include the banks."
484,CHAIR POWELL,It might be hard for me to identify something that we don’t worry about rather than that we do worry about.
485,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re watching those things very carefully.
486,CHAIR POWELL,"And as we see things unfold—as we see what’s happening with credit conditions and, and also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we’ll be able to take, to the extent it’s appropriate, we can take, if they’re macroeconomic implications, we can take that into account in our rate setting."
487,CHAIR POWELL,And so I guess that’s what I would say.
488,MARK HAMRICK,Can I just follow up on the last part of that?
489,MARK HAMRICK,Do you—do you risk further exacerbating those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points?
490,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s—and, and I was—I guess I meant to address that by saying as we—as we watch, we’ll see what’s happening."
491,CHAIR POWELL,"And if we—if we’re seeing the kind of tightening of conditions that, that you could be referring to, then we can factor that—because really, we’re—we use our—our rate tool is, is, you know, is—it really has macroeconomic purposes."
492,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’ll, we’ll take that into account."
493,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, we have responsibility for financial stability as well."
494,CHAIR POWELL,And that also is a factor that we’re always going to be considering.
495,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you very much.
