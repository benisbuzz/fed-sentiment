0,CHAIR POWELL,"Good afternoon, and welcome."
1,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy."
3,CHAIR POWELL,"We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt."
4,CHAIR POWELL,"Even so, we have more work to do."
5,CHAIR POWELL,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.
6,CHAIR POWELL,"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points."
9,CHAIR POWELL,We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
10,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
11,CHAIR POWELL,Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time.
12,CHAIR POWELL,I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
13,CHAIR POWELL,"The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend pace of 1 percent."
14,CHAIR POWELL,Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter.
15,CHAIR POWELL,"Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace, in part reflecting tighter financial conditions over the past year."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
17,CHAIR POWELL,Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
18,CHAIR POWELL,"Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month over the last three months."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the labor market continues to be out of balance."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"Labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers, and the labor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago."
22,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
23,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months ending in December, total PCE prices rose 5.0 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.4 percent."
24,CHAIR POWELL,The inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases.
25,CHAIR POWELL,"And, while recent developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
27,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s not grounds for complacency.
28,CHAIR POWELL,"Although inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high."
29,CHAIR POWELL,"The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched."
30,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
31,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"We are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4½ to 4¾ percent."
34,CHAIR POWELL,And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.
35,CHAIR POWELL,"With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 4½ percentage points over the past year."
36,CHAIR POWELL,We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
37,CHAIR POWELL,"We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step-down from last year’s rapid pace of increases."
40,CHAIR POWELL,Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the Committee to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals as we determine the extent of future increases that will be required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance.
41,CHAIR POWELL,"We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
42,CHAIR POWELL,We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.
43,CHAIR POWELL,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
44,CHAIR POWELL,Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
45,CHAIR POWELL,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
46,CHAIR POWELL,The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.
47,CHAIR POWELL,"We will stay the course, until the job is done."
48,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
49,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
50,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
51,CHAIR POWELL,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
58,CHAIR POWELL,So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent.
59,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year."
60,CHAIR POWELL,I would say that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions.
61,CHAIR POWELL,"And it is our judgment that we’re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate."
62,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, many things affect financial conditions—not just our policy."
63,CHAIR POWELL,And we will take into account overall financial conditions along with many other factors as we set policy.
69,CHAIR POWELL,So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market.
70,CHAIR POWELL,But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see under way is really at an early stage.
71,CHAIR POWELL,"What you see is, really, in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated."
72,CHAIR POWELL,So you see that.
73,CHAIR POWELL,"In the other—in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while but then to come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be lower."
74,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in those two sectors, you’ve got a good story."
75,CHAIR POWELL,"The issue is that we have a large sector called nonhousing service—core nonhousing services, where we don’t see disinflation yet."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"But I would say that, so far, what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market conditions."
78,CHAIR POWELL,Go ahead.
80,CHAIR POWELL,No.
81,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting, and we’ll see at that time."
82,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now getting under way, and we continue to get strong labor market data."
83,CHAIR POWELL,"So—but, you know, we’ll update those forecasts in March."
92,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’re right about the data, of course."
93,CHAIR POWELL,What we did see—we’ve seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated.
94,CHAIR POWELL,"The job openings number has—in JOLTS, has been quite volatile recently."
95,CHAIR POWELL,"Yeah, I did see that it moved up—back up this morning."
96,CHAIR POWELL,I do think that it’s probably an important indicator.
97,CHAIR POWELL,"The ratio, I guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work."
98,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s an indicator, but nonetheless, we—you’re right, we do see wages moving down."
99,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation."
100,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, quits are still at an elevated level."
101,CHAIR POWELL,"So many, many—by many, many indicators, the job market is still very strong."
107,CHAIR POWELL,So you’re right.
108,CHAIR POWELL,"At the December meeting, we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that’s obviously back in December."
109,CHAIR POWELL,And the median for that was between 5 and 5¼ percent.
110,CHAIR POWELL,"At the March meeting, we’re going to update those assessments."
111,CHAIR POWELL,We did not update them today.
112,CHAIR POWELL,"We did, however, continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent."
113,CHAIR POWELL,"We think we’ve covered a lot of ground, and financial conditions have certainly tightened."
114,CHAIR POWELL,I would say we still think there’s work to do there.
115,CHAIR POWELL,We haven’t made a decision on exactly where that will be.
116,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, you know, we’re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then the May meeting."
117,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be.
118,CHAIR POWELL,It could certainly be higher than we’re writing down right now.
119,CHAIR POWELL,"If we come to the view that we need to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December, we would certainly do that."
120,CHAIR POWELL,"At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction, then we’ll, you know, we’ll make data-dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course."
122,CHAIR POWELL,I guess I would say it this way.
123,CHAIR POWELL,I continue to think that it’s very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually were close but didn’t get the job done.
124,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation springs back, and we have to go back in."
125,CHAIR POWELL,"And now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing."
126,CHAIR POWELL,"This is a very difficult risk to manage, whereas I—of course, we have no incentive and no desire to overtighten."
127,CHAIR POWELL,"But we, you know, if we feel like we’ve gone too far, we can certainly—and inflation is coming down faster than we expect, then we have tools that would work on that."
128,CHAIR POWELL,"So I do think that, in this situation, where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know, the job is not fully done."
129,CHAIR POWELL,"As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents 56 percent of the core inflation index where we don’t see disinflation yet."
130,CHAIR POWELL,So we don’t see it.
131,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not happening yet.
132,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation in the core services ex.
133,CHAIR POWELL,housing is still running at 4 percent on a 6- and 12-month basis.
134,CHAIR POWELL,So there’s not—nothing happening there.
136,CHAIR POWELL,"So, for the third sector, we don’t see anything here."
137,CHAIR POWELL,So I think it would be premature—it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that we’ve really got this.
138,CHAIR POWELL,"We need to see—our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down."
140,CHAIR POWELL,"There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they should be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector."
141,CHAIR POWELL,"But, so far, we don’t see that."
142,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work left to do."
154,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess I would say it this way.
155,CHAIR POWELL,"We can now say, I think, for the first time that the disinflationary process has started."
156,CHAIR POWELL,We can see that.
157,CHAIR POWELL,"And we see it, really, in goods prices so far."
158,CHAIR POWELL,Goods prices is a big sector.
159,CHAIR POWELL,"We—this is what we thought would happen since the very beginning, and now here it is actually happening, and for the reasons we thought."
160,CHAIR POWELL,"We—you know, it’s supply chains, it’s shortages, and it’s demand revolving back towards services."
161,CHAIR POWELL,So this is a good thing.
162,CHAIR POWELL,This is a good thing.
163,CHAIR POWELL,"But that’s, you know, around a quarter of the PCE price index—core PCE price index."
164,CHAIR POWELL,"So the second sector is housing services, and that’s driven by very different things."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"And we—as I mentioned, with housing services, we expect, and other forecasters expect, that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but will then come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be soft."
166,CHAIR POWELL,And we do assume that.
167,CHAIR POWELL,So we think that that’s sort of in the pipeline.
168,CHAIR POWELL,"And we actually see disinflation in the goods sector, and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half."
169,CHAIR POWELL,So this is good.
170,CHAIR POWELL,And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this is good.
171,CHAIR POWELL,"We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core goods ex."
172,CHAIR POWELL,"housing—sorry, the core services ex."
173,CHAIR POWELL,housing sector that I talked about.
174,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t see it yet.
175,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—you know, it’s seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them are the same."
176,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we have a sense of what’s going on in each of those different subsections."
177,CHAIR POWELL,"Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent of that is, you know, research would show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be important."
178,CHAIR POWELL,Some of the other ones it’s—the labor market is not going to be important.
179,CHAIR POWELL,Many other factors will drive it.
180,CHAIR POWELL,"In any case, we don’t see disinflation in that sector yet."
181,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think we need to see that it’s the majority of the core PCE index, which is the thing that we think is the best predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with] our mandate."
182,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s not that we’re not—we’re neither optimistic nor pessimistic.
183,CHAIR POWELL,We’re just telling you that we don’t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector.
184,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we will fairly soon, but we don’t see it yet."
185,CHAIR POWELL,"Until we do, I think we—you know, we see ourselves, we’ve got to be honest with ourselves, but we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent—we’ll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down."
186,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re just going to have to—we have to complete the job.
187,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, that’s what we’re here for."
194,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’ve—you know, we’ve raised rates 4½ percentage points, and we’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive."
196,CHAIR POWELL,"We think, because inflation is still running very hot."
197,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we’re thinking about that."
198,CHAIR POWELL,"It really—the story we’re telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I’ve just gone through a couple of times."
199,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, we don’t see it affecting the services sector ex."
200,CHAIR POWELL,housing yet.
201,CHAIR POWELL,"But, I mean, I think our assessment is that we’re not very far from that level."
202,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t know that, though."
203,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know that.
204,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think we’re—you know, we’re living in a world of significant uncertainty."
205,CHAIR POWELL,"I would look across the rate—the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by—you know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve."
206,CHAIR POWELL,I think policy is restrictive.
207,CHAIR POWELL,We’re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough.
208,CHAIR POWELL,That’s all.
209,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’re going to—you know, that’s why we’re slowing down to 25 basis points."
210,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process.
212,CHAIR POWELL,"We—you know, you’ll see that the minutes will come out in three weeks, and we’ll give you a lot of detail."
213,CHAIR POWELL,"I—you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the path ahead and the state of the economy."
214,CHAIR POWELL,"And I wouldn’t want to start to drive the—describe all the details there, but that was the sense of the discussion, was really talking quite a bit about the path forward."
219,CHAIR POWELL,"So your question is, would we—say your question again."
221,CHAIR POWELL,"So you’re really asking about—you’re asking about prioritization, in effect, is what— VICTORIA GUIDA."
222,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
223,CHAIR POWELL,Yes.
224,CHAIR POWELL,Okay.
225,CHAIR POWELL,So I feel like I have to say this.
226,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s only one way forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations when due."
227,CHAIR POWELL,And any deviations from that path would be highly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner.
228,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent."
229,CHAIR POWELL,And I’m just going to leave it at that.
231,CHAIR POWELL,I’m just going to leave it at that.
232,CHAIR POWELL,"This is a matter that’s to be resolved between, really—it’s really Congress’ job to raise the debt ceiling."
233,CHAIR POWELL,"And I gather there are discussions happening, but they don’t involve us."
234,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not involved in those discussions.
235,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re the fiscal agent.
242,CHAIR POWELL,So the Committee obviously did not see this as the time to pause.
243,CHAIR POWELL,"We judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points."
244,CHAIR POWELL,And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent.
245,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s the judgment that we made.
246,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’re going to write down new forecasts in March, and we’ll—you know, we’ll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will."
250,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I think this is not something that the Committee is thinking about or exploring in any kind of detail."
251,CHAIR POWELL,"In principle, though, you know, we used to—the thing we used to do was go every other meeting, if you remember, 25 basis points, and that was considered a fast pace."
252,CHAIR POWELL,So I think a lot of options are available.
253,CHAIR POWELL,"And I mean, you saw what the Bank of Canada did and, you know, they left it that they’re willing to raise rates after pausing."
254,CHAIR POWELL,But this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding right now.
264,CHAIR POWELL,So a couple of things.
265,CHAIR POWELL,"First, on the forecast, if—you’re right—if you take very short-term three-month, say, measures of PCE—core PCE inflation, they’re quite low right now."
266,CHAIR POWELL,"But that’s because that’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from goods inflation."
267,CHAIR POWELL,"Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer-run trend of something around zero, something like that."
268,CHAIR POWELL,"So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go back up to 4 percent by the middle of the year, for example."
269,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s really where the sustainable level is.
270,CHAIR POWELL,It’s more like at 4 percent.
271,CHAIR POWELL,So that would suggest there’s work left to do.
272,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, let’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible."
273,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data dependent."
274,CHAIR POWELL,We would take that into account.
275,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the non—sorry, the core nonhousing services, as I mentioned earlier, it’s a very diverse sector, six or seven sectors."
276,CHAIR POWELL,"And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that— subsectors of that sector are—we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the labor market in a way, but some of the other sectors are not."
277,CHAIR POWELL,"And, for example, you know, financial services is a big sector that’s really not driven by labor markets—wages."
279,CHAIR POWELL,"So, clearly, labor is important for restaurants but so are food prices."
280,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, transportation services is going to be driven by fuel prices, for example."
281,CHAIR POWELL,So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation.
282,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you’re not going to have, you know, a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the labor market."
283,CHAIR POWELL,"And I don’t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question."
284,CHAIR POWELL,I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften.
285,CHAIR POWELL,"And so far, we’ve got—as I mentioned, in goods, we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market."
286,CHAIR POWELL,I think most forecasters would say that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here.
287,CHAIR POWELL,But I still think—I continue to think that there’s a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment.
288,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s because the—you know, the setting we’re in is quite different."
289,CHAIR POWELL,"The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior—you know, in prior business cycles."
290,CHAIR POWELL,"And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down."
291,CHAIR POWELL,And I think will—a story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough.
292,CHAIR POWELL,"But I think there is—there’s ongoing disinflation, and we don’t yet see weakening in the labor market."
293,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ll have to see.
295,CHAIR POWELL,Certainly possible.
296,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
297,CHAIR POWELL,Absolutely it’s possible.
298,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it’s a question—no one really knows."
299,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s because this is not like the other business cycles in so many ways.
300,CHAIR POWELL,"It may well be that as—yeah, as—that it will take more slowing than we expect—than I expect to get inflation down to 2 percent."
301,CHAIR POWELL,But I don’t—that’s not my base case.
302,CHAIR POWELL,My base case is that the economy can return to 2 percent inflation without a really significant downturn or a really big increase in unemployment.
303,CHAIR POWELL,I think that’s a possible outcome.
304,CHAIR POWELL,"I think many, many forecasters would say it’s not the most likely outcome."
305,CHAIR POWELL,But I would say there’s a chance of it.
311,CHAIR POWELL,"So I do think you—most forecasts and, you know, my own assessment would be that that growth will continue—positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year."
312,CHAIR POWELL,"We had growth of—GDP growth of 1 percent last year and also final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator, of about 1 percent."
313,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, you know, most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year."
314,CHAIR POWELL,"There are other factors, though, that need to be considered."
315,CHAIR POWELL,"You will have seen that the global picture is improving a bit, and that will matter for us, potentially."
316,CHAIR POWELL,"The labor market remains very, very strong, and that’s job creation, that’s wages."
317,CHAIR POWELL,"As inflation does come down, sentiment will improve."
318,CHAIR POWELL,"You also—state and local governments are really flush these days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks."
319,CHAIR POWELL,So I think that’s going to support—they’re also spending a lot.
320,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s a lot of spending coming in the construction pipeline, both private and public."
321,CHAIR POWELL,And so that’s going to support economic activity.
322,CHAIR POWELL,So I think there’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year.
323,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s my base case, is that there will be positive growth this year."
328,CHAIR POWELL,Fine.
329,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks.
330,CHAIR POWELL,Fine.
337,CHAIR POWELL,"So I don’t think there’s, you know, going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that."
338,CHAIR POWELL,I think it’s just an accumulating—accumulation of evidence.
339,CHAIR POWELL,"So, of course, we’ll be looking—by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports, and we’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will."
341,CHAIR POWELL,"And soon after that, we’ll have another ECI wage report, which, as you know, is a report that we like because it adjusts for composition and it’s very complete."
342,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, the one we got, I guess it was yesterday, was some—was constructive."
343,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level."
344,CHAIR POWELL,They’re still at a level that’s way above—well above where they were before the pandemic.
345,CHAIR POWELL,"So I don’t want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it’s going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy over time."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"But I will say, though, we—you know, it is our job to restore price stability and achieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public."
347,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not—market participants have a very different job.
348,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a fine job.
349,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a great job.
350,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, I did that job for years but in one form or another."
351,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, we have to deliver that."
352,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we are strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years."
361,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t think we know, honestly."
362,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the—so we, of course, expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’t come down all through ’22."
363,CHAIR POWELL,"And now it’s coming down, and it’s come down pretty fast."
364,CHAIR POWELL,So I would say these are—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a global pandemic and we shut the economy down and Congress did what it did and we did what we did.
365,CHAIR POWELL,It’s just—it’s unique.
366,CHAIR POWELL,So I think certainty is just not appropriate here.
367,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation—it’s just harder to forecast inflation.
368,CHAIR POWELL,It may come down faster.
369,CHAIR POWELL,It may take longer to come down.
370,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target, and we will do that."
371,CHAIR POWELL,"But I think we’re going to be cautious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think that the game is won because, you know, it’s—we’ve got a long way to go."
372,CHAIR POWELL,It’s just—it’s the early stages of disinflation.
373,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in disinflation, but that’s great."
374,CHAIR POWELL,But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that it’s going to take some time.
375,CHAIR POWELL,That’s all.
377,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, so—again, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SEP and—I mean, there are many different forecasts, but, generally, it’s a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly."
378,CHAIR POWELL,"And, in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year."
379,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster, that’s a different thing."
380,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, if that happens—inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we’ll be seeing that, and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy."
387,CHAIR POWELL,"I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is largely due to the market’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly."
388,CHAIR POWELL,I think that’s the bigger part of that.
389,CHAIR POWELL,"So, again, as I just mentioned, we—you know, our forecasts—different participants have different forecasts, but, generally, those forecasts are for continued subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession."
390,CHAIR POWELL,"And we have inflation moving down, you know, into the—somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower than that this year."
391,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll update that in March, but that’s what we thought in December."
392,CHAIR POWELL,Markets are past that.
393,CHAIR POWELL,"They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that."
394,CHAIR POWELL,So we’ll just have to see.
395,CHAIR POWELL,"And we have a different view and—a different view, it’s a different forecast, really."
396,CHAIR POWELL,"And given our outlook, I just—I don’t see us cutting rates this year if we get—if our outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now."
397,CHAIR POWELL,"If we do see inflation coming down much more quickly, that’ll play into our policy setting, of course."
404,CHAIR POWELL,That’s the general sense of it.
405,CHAIR POWELL,"Look, we understand—I personally understand well that COVID is still out there, but that it’s no longer playing an important role in our economy."
406,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think we just—we knew we would take it out at some point."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s never a perfect time, but we thought that—you know, people are handling it better, and the economy and the society are handling it better now."
408,CHAIR POWELL,"It doesn’t really need to be in a—you know, in the Fed’s monthly, you know, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health issue."
414,CHAIR POWELL,I do.
415,CHAIR POWELL,"Yeah, I do."
416,CHAIR POWELL,You don’t see that yet.
417,CHAIR POWELL,"But the whole point is, you know, if you—once you see it, you have a serious problem."
418,CHAIR POWELL,"That means that, effectively, in people’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue."
419,CHAIR POWELL,And once that happens—that’s what we can’t allow to happen.
420,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, so that’s why we worry that the longer we’re at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long, every day, you know, the more risk of something like that."
421,CHAIR POWELL,"But no, there’s not much—it’s more of a risk."
422,CHAIR POWELL,It always has been more of a risk than anything else.
423,CHAIR POWELL,"By the way, I think it’s becoming less salient."
424,CHAIR POWELL,"And people are—you know, we pick that up in conversations."
425,CHAIR POWELL,"And I’ve seen some data, too, that show people are, you know, gradually—they’re glad that inflation is coming down."
426,CHAIR POWELL,People really don’t like inflation.
427,CHAIR POWELL,"And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity."
428,CHAIR POWELL,"You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they’re very, very low with 3½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical standards."
431,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think once inflation is seen to be coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope."
433,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know, are the—essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of the process of creating inflation."
434,CHAIR POWELL,That’s a sort of bedrock belief.
435,CHAIR POWELL,"In one way or another, it has to be."
436,CHAIR POWELL,We think it’s important.
437,CHAIR POWELL,"And, in this case, I would say, the risk eight months ago or so, longer-term inflation expectations had moved up."
438,CHAIR POWELL,We moved quite vigorously last year.
439,CHAIR POWELL,"Expectations are—seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer end."
440,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s, you know—and that’s—I think that’s very reassuring."
441,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, you know, the markets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent and it’s just a matter of us following through."
442,CHAIR POWELL,That's immeasurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down.
443,CHAIR POWELL,"The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down, that’ll be part of the process of getting it down."
444,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s a very positive thing.
452,CHAIR POWELL,I would put it this way.
453,CHAIR POWELL,It’s something that we monitor carefully.
454,CHAIR POWELL,Financial conditions didn’t really change much from the December meeting to now.
455,CHAIR POWELL,They mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place.
456,CHAIR POWELL,It’s important that the markets do reflect the tightening that we’re putting in place.
457,CHAIR POWELL,"As we’ve discussed a couple times here, there’s a difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast inflation will come down."
458,CHAIR POWELL,We’re just going to have to see.
459,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I’m not going to try to persuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and some patience and that we’ll need to keep rates higher for longer."
460,CHAIR POWELL,But we’ll see.
466,CHAIR POWELL,"Look, I—it’s very hard to think about all the different possible ramifications."
467,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think the answer is, basically, I don’t think there’s likely to be any important interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting, and—as it will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’t risk, you know, the progress we’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector."
468,CHAIR POWELL,I believe that that will happen.
469,CHAIR POWELL,I believe it will happen.
470,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we, of course, will monitor money market conditions carefully as—you know, as the process moves on."
471,CHAIR POWELL,"For example, the Treasury General Account will shrink down, and then it will grow back up."
472,CHAIR POWELL,And we understand there’ll be lots of flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves.
473,CHAIR POWELL,We understand all that.
474,CHAIR POWELL,We’re watching it carefully.
475,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll just be monitoring it.
476,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you very much.
