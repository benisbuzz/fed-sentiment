0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,It’s nice to see everyone in person for the first time in a couple years.
2,CHAIR POWELL,"Before I go into the details of today’s meeting, I’d like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the American people."
3,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down."
4,CHAIR POWELL,We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.
5,CHAIR POWELL,The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved resilient.
6,CHAIR POWELL,It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
7,CHAIR POWELL,"From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ½ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target rate for the federal funds rate will be appropriate."
9,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we are beginning the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
10,CHAIR POWELL,I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
11,CHAIR POWELL,"After expanding at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely reflected swings in inventories and net exports—two volatile categories whose movements last quarter likely carry little signal for future growth."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Indeed, household spending and business fixed investment continued to expand briskly."
14,CHAIR POWELL,The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight.
15,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the first three months of the year, employment rose by nearly 1.7 million jobs."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"In March, the unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic, and near-five-decade, low of 3.6 percent."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"Labor demand is very strong, and, while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"Employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at the fastest pace in many years."
20,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
21,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 6.6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"Disruptions to supply have been larger, and longer lasting, than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services."
24,CHAIR POWELL,The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.
25,CHAIR POWELL,And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to further exacerbate supply chain disruptions as well.
26,CHAIR POWELL,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is causing tremendous loss and hardship, and our thoughts and sympathies are with the people of Ukraine."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"Our job is to consider the implications for the U.S. economy, which remain highly uncertain."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition to the effects on inflation, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, creating spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels."
29,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
30,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
31,CHAIR POWELL,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to restoring price stability."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point and stated that it “anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.” We also decided to begin the process of reducing the size of our balance sheet, which will play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
34,CHAIR POWELL,We are on a path to move our policy rate expeditiously to more normal levels.
35,CHAIR POWELL,"Assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in line with expectations, there is a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50-basis-point increases should be on the table at the next couple of meetings."
36,CHAIR POWELL,We will make our decisions meeting by meeting as we learn from incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.
37,CHAIR POWELL,And we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.
38,CHAIR POWELL,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.
39,CHAIR POWELL,"With regard to our balance sheet, we also issued our specific plans for reducing our securities holdings."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"Consistent with the principles we issued in January, we intend to significantly reduce the size of our balance sheet over time in a predictable manner by allowing the principal payments from our securities holdings to roll off the balance sheet, up to monthly cap amounts."
41,CHAIR POWELL,"For Treasury securities, the cap will be $30 billion per month for three months and May 4, 2022 will then increase to $60 billion per month."
42,CHAIR POWELL,"The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL this monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon securities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills."
43,CHAIR POWELL,"For agency mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $17.5 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $35 billion per month."
44,CHAIR POWELL,"At the current level of mortgage rates, the actual pace of agency MBS runoff would likely be less than this monthly cap amount."
45,CHAIR POWELL,Our balance sheet decisions are guided by our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
46,CHAIR POWELL,"And, in that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments."
47,CHAIR POWELL,Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.
48,CHAIR POWELL,"Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store."
49,CHAIR POWELL,We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
50,CHAIR POWELL,And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.
51,CHAIR POWELL,We are highly attentive to inflation risks.
52,CHAIR POWELL,The Committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.
53,CHAIR POWELL,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
54,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
55,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
56,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
57,CHAIR POWELL,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
64,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
65,CHAIR POWELL,So you’re right—3.6 percent unemployment is just about as low as it’s been in 50 years.
66,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would say that I expect, and Committee members generally expect, that we’ll get some additional participation."
67,CHAIR POWELL,So people will be coming back into the labor force.
68,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve seen that particularly among prime-age people.
69,CHAIR POWELL,"And that will, of course, tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit."
70,CHAIR POWELL,"I would also expect, though, that job creation will slow."
71,CHAIR POWELL,"Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month in recent months—very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy."
72,CHAIR POWELL,"And so we think—with fiscal policy less supportive, with monetary policy less supportive, we think that job creation will slow as well."
73,CHAIR POWELL,So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further.
74,CHAIR POWELL,But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation.
75,CHAIR POWELL,"Implications for inflation—really, the wages matter a fair amount for companies, particularly in the service sector."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"Wages are running high, the highest they’ve run in quite some time."
77,CHAIR POWELL,"And they are one good example, or good illustration, really, of how tight the labor market really is, the fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades."
78,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market.
79,CHAIR POWELL,"So we think through our policies—through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example, of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in—we’d like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still May 4, 2022 high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with 2 percent inflation."
80,CHAIR POWELL,That’s Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL our expectation.
83,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess I would say it this way: There’s a path.
84,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level."
85,CHAIR POWELL,"There’re 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11.5 million vacancies, 6 million unemployed people."
86,CHAIR POWELL,"So we haven’t been in that place on the vacancy, sort of the vacancy/unemployed curve, the Beveridge curve."
87,CHAIR POWELL,We haven’t been at that sort of level of a ratio in the modern era.
88,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down and, as a result—and they could come down fairly significantly and, I think, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are."
89,CHAIR POWELL,"And that would give us a chance to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially."
90,CHAIR POWELL,So there’s a path to that.
91,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, I would say, I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or outcome, if you will."
92,CHAIR POWELL,And I’ll give you a couple of reasons for that.
93,CHAIR POWELL,"One is, households and businesses are in very strong financial shape."
94,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re looking at, you know, excess savings on balance sheets—excess in the sense that they’re substantially larger than the prior trend."
95,CHAIR POWELL,Businesses are in good financial shape.
96,CHAIR POWELL,"The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong."
97,CHAIR POWELL,And so it doesn’t seem to be anywhere close to a downturn.
98,CHAIR POWELL,"Therefore, the economy is strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy."
99,CHAIR POWELL,"So, but I’ll say, I do expect that this May 4, 2022 will be very challenging; it’s not going to be easy."
100,CHAIR POWELL,"And it may well depend, of course, on events Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL that are not under our control."
101,CHAIR POWELL,"But our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome, and that’s what we’re going to do."
114,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
115,CHAIR POWELL,So a 75-basis-point increase is not something the Committee is actively considering.
116,CHAIR POWELL,"What we are doing is, we raised [the funds rate by] 50 basis points today."
117,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ve said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are consistent with our expectations, there’s a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50-basis-point increases should be on the table for the next couple of meetings."
118,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re going to make those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we’ll be paying close attention to the incoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions."
119,CHAIR POWELL,"And, finally, of course, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they evolve."
120,CHAIR POWELL,So the test is really just as I laid it out—economic and financial conditions evolving broadly in line with expectations.
121,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I think expectations are that we’ll start to see inflation, you know, flattening out—and not necessarily declining yet, but we’ll see more evidence."
122,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak May 4, 2022 or flattening out."
123,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll want to know more than just some evidence.
124,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll want to really feel Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL like we’re making some progress there.
125,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’re going to make these decisions, and there’ll be a lot more information."
126,CHAIR POWELL,I just think we want to see that information as we get there.
127,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance."
128,CHAIR POWELL,There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world.
129,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, we’re leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision as we get there."
131,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t think the one month is—no.
132,CHAIR POWELL,No.
133,CHAIR POWELL,One month’s reading doesn’t tell us much.
134,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we‘d want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a direction that gives us more comfort."
135,CHAIR POWELL,"As I said, we’ve got two months now where core inflation is a little lower, but we’re not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort."
136,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, I think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled—that inflation, in fact, is under control and starting to come down."
137,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, it’s not like we would stop."
138,CHAIR POWELL,We would just go back to 25-basis-point increases.
139,CHAIR POWELL,It’ll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive.
140,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, our expectation is, if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50-basis-point increases on the table at the next two meetings."
147,CHAIR POWELL,So—neutral.
148,CHAIR POWELL,"When we talk about the neutral rate, we’re really talking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down."
149,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s a concept, really."
150,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not something we can identify with any precision.
151,CHAIR POWELL,So we estimate it within broad bands of uncertainty.
152,CHAIR POWELL,And the current estimates on the Committee are sort of 2 to 3 percent.
153,CHAIR POWELL,"And also, that’s a longer-run estimate."
154,CHAIR POWELL,That’s an estimate for an economy that’s at full employment and 2 percent inflation.
155,CHAIR POWELL,"So, really, what we’re doing is, we’re raising rates expeditiously to what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral."
156,CHAIR POWELL,But we know that there’s not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there.
158,CHAIR POWELL,"Our policy affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy."
159,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re going to be looking at the effect of our policy moves on financial conditions.
161,CHAIR POWELL,And then we’re going to be looking at the effects on the economy.
162,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re going to be making a judgment about whether we’ve done enough to get us on a path to restore price stability.
163,CHAIR POWELL,It’s that.
164,CHAIR POWELL,"So if that path happens to involve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral, then we will not hesitate to go to those levels."
165,CHAIR POWELL,We won’t.
166,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, there’s a sort of false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers don’t really feel."
167,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, you’re going to raise rates, and you’re going to be kind of inquiring how that is affecting the economy through financial conditions."
168,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, if higher rates are required, then we won’t hesitate to deliver them."
175,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t really see strong evidence of that yet, but that does not in any way make us comfortable."
176,CHAIR POWELL,"I think if you look at short-term inflation expectations, they’re quite elevated."
177,CHAIR POWELL,"And you can look at that and say, “Well, that’s because people expect inflation to come down.” And, in fact, inflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply."
178,CHAIR POWELL,"Longer-term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to—but only to levels where they were in 2014, by some measures."
179,CHAIR POWELL,So you can look at that.
180,CHAIR POWELL,And I think that’s a fair description of the picture.
181,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s really about the risks.
182,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t see a wage–price spiral.
183,CHAIR POWELL,"We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they’re doing that, but there have been price shocks."
184,CHAIR POWELL,"So I just think it takes you back to the basic point—was that we know we need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal, neutral levels."
185,CHAIR POWELL,And we need to look around and keep going if we don’t see that financial conditions have tightened adequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we’re not where we need to be.
186,CHAIR POWELL,"So, again, you don’t see those things yet, but I would say there’s no basis for feeling comfortable about that."
187,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a risk that we simply can’t run.
188,CHAIR POWELL,We can’t allow a wage–price spiral to happen.
189,CHAIR POWELL,And we can’t allow inflation expectations to become unanchored.
190,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just something that we can’t allow to happen, and so we’ll look at it that way."
198,CHAIR POWELL,Well.
199,CHAIR POWELL,So our tools don’t really work on supply shocks.
200,CHAIR POWELL,Our tools work on demand.
201,CHAIR POWELL,"And to the extent we can’t affect, really, oil prices or other commodity prices or food prices and things like that, so we can’t affect those."
202,CHAIR POWELL,But there’s a job to do on demand.
203,CHAIR POWELL,"And that—you can see that in the labor market, where demand is substantially in excess of supply of workers."
204,CHAIR POWELL,And you can see it in the product markets as well.
205,CHAIR POWELL,But I guess I’m just pointing out that—a couple of things.
206,CHAIR POWELL,"For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in China, they’re likely to, both, add to headline inflation."
207,CHAIR POWELL,"And people are going to be suffering from that, you know."
208,CHAIR POWELL,"People almost suffer more from food and energy shocks then, but—even though they don’t actually tell us much about the future path."
209,CHAIR POWELL,So the second thing is that they’re both capable of preventing further progress in supply chains healing or even making supply chains temporarily worse.
210,CHAIR POWELL,"So they’re going to weigh on the process of global supply chain healing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too."
211,CHAIR POWELL,"So, in a way, they’re two further negative shocks that have hit really in the last, you know, 60 days, 90 days."
218,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, I’ll just say: For now, we’re focused on doing the job we need to do on demand, and there’s plenty to be done there."
219,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, if you look at it, it’s essentially almost two to one, job vacancies to unemployed people."
220,CHAIR POWELL,There’s a lot of excess demand.
221,CHAIR POWELL,There’re more than 5 million more employed plus job openings than there are the size of the labor force.
222,CHAIR POWELL,So there’s an imbalance there that we have to do our work on.
223,CHAIR POWELL,"A very difficult situation—you know, you would look at core inflation, which wouldn’t include the commodity price shocks."
224,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, that’s one of the reasons we would tend to focus on that, because we can have more of an effect on that, but it would be a very difficult situation."
225,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, we have to be sure that inflation expectations remain anchored."
226,CHAIR POWELL,"And I mean, that’s part of our job, too, so we’d be watching that carefully."
227,CHAIR POWELL,And it puts any central bank in a very difficult situation.
239,CHAIR POWELL,"Okay, so in terms of the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio, we don’t have a goal in mind."
240,CHAIR POWELL,"There’s no specific number that we’re saying, “We’ve got to get to that.” May 4, 2022 It’s really, you’ve got to get to a place where the labor market appears to be more in balance."
241,CHAIR POWELL,"Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And that depends not only on the level of those things—it also, it depends on how well the matching functions in the labor markets are working."
242,CHAIR POWELL,"Because, you know, the longer these expansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that, and the Beveridge curve shifts out."
243,CHAIR POWELL,"And that also tends to, you know, to help."
244,CHAIR POWELL,So there isn’t a specific number.
245,CHAIR POWELL,"I will say we were—you know, I think, I think when we got to one-to-one in the, you know, in the late teens, we thought that was a pretty good number."
246,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, we’re not shooting for any particular number."
247,CHAIR POWELL,"What we’d like to see is progress, but we’re not really looking at that."
248,CHAIR POWELL,That’s an intermediate variable.
249,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re looking at wages, and we’re looking at, ultimately, inflation."
250,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works."
251,CHAIR POWELL,"You can think of it as, you know, interest-sensitive spending, and then you can think of another big one as asset values broadly."
252,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, there’re big models with, you know, a lot of different channels that are related to that."
253,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we don’t focus on any one market—the equity market or the housing market—we focus on financial conditions broadly."
254,CHAIR POWELL,"So we wouldn’t be targeting any one market, as you suggest, for going up or down or taking a view on whether it’s at a good level or a bad level."
255,CHAIR POWELL,"We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions—all the different financial conditions indexes, for example, which include equity."
256,CHAIR POWELL,"But they also include debt and other, many other things—credit spreads, things like that—too."
263,CHAIR POWELL,"So, first, the first thing to say is that we understand."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"And some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation, and many aren’t."
265,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s very unpleasant.
266,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just something people don’t—when they experience it for the first time, you’re paying more for the same thing."
267,CHAIR POWELL,"If you’re a normal economic person, then you probably don’t have that much extra to spend."
268,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s immediately hitting your spending on groceries, on, you know, on gasoline, on energy, and things like that."
269,CHAIR POWELL,So we understand the pain involved.
271,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant, high nature doesn’t get entrenched in the economy."
272,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s what we’re here for, one of the main things we’re here for—perhaps the most fundamental thing we’re here for."
273,CHAIR POWELL,"And the way we do that is, we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down."
274,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, the process of getting there involves higher rates—so higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates, and things like that."
275,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s not going to be pleasant either.
276,CHAIR POWELL,"But in the end, everyone is better off."
277,CHAIR POWELL,Everyone— particularly people on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.
278,CHAIR POWELL,And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices.
279,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll do it as quickly and effectively as we can.
280,CHAIR POWELL,"We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in unemployment or, you know, a really sharp slowdown."
281,CHAIR POWELL,"But, ultimately, we think about the medium and longer term, and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done—the sooner, the better."
288,CHAIR POWELL,So the economy is doing fairly well.
289,CHAIR POWELL,We expect growth to be solid this year.
290,CHAIR POWELL,"And we see, you know, household spending and business investment as fairly strong—and even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts."
291,CHAIR POWELL,"So, and the labor market—if you look at the labor market, for people who are out of work and looking, there are lots of job opportunities for—wages are moving up and at rates that haven’t been seen in quite a long time."
292,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s a good time to be a worker looking to, you know, either change jobs or get a wage increase in your current job."
293,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s a strong economy, and nothing about it suggests that it’s close to, or vulnerable to, a recession."
294,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, of course, given events around the world and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity."
295,CHAIR POWELL,"Certainly, it will not be—last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic."
296,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent."
297,CHAIR POWELL,"But most forecasters have growth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above 2 percent."
299,CHAIR POWELL,"So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession—without, you know, a severe downturn; without materially high, higher unemployment."
300,CHAIR POWELL,And I mentioned the reasons for that.
301,CHAIR POWELL,So I see a strong economy now.
302,CHAIR POWELL,"I see a very strong labor market, for example."
303,CHAIR POWELL,"Businesses can’t find the people to hire—they can’t May 4, 2022 find them."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"So, typically, in a recession, you would have unemployment."
305,CHAIR POWELL,Now you have surplus Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL demand.
306,CHAIR POWELL,"So there should be room, in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting people out of work."
307,CHAIR POWELL,The issue will come that we don’t have precision surgical tools.
308,CHAIR POWELL,"We have, essentially, interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they’re famously blunt tools."
309,CHAIR POWELL,They’re not capable of surgical precision.
310,CHAIR POWELL,So I would agree.
311,CHAIR POWELL,"No one thinks this will be easy, no one thinks it’s straightforward, but there is certainly a plausible path to this, and I do think we’ve got a good chance to do that."
312,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, our job is not to rate the chances—it is to try to achieve it."
313,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s what we’re doing.
314,CHAIR POWELL,"There are a range of opinions, though, and that’s only appropriate."
320,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it’s really the Fed that has responsibility for price stability."
321,CHAIR POWELL,"And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity, we take it as a given, and we don’t evaluate it—it’s not our job, really."
322,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t have an oversight function there.
323,CHAIR POWELL,"And we look at it as our job, given all the factors that are happening, to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability."
324,CHAIR POWELL,"So if Congress or the Administration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I’m not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that."
325,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s not, it’s really not our role—we need to stay in our lane and do our job."
326,CHAIR POWELL,"When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know, give other people advice [laughter]."
327,CHAIR POWELL,"Right now, we need to focus on, just focus on doing our job."
328,CHAIR POWELL,And I’ll stick to that.
329,CHAIR POWELL,Stick in our lane.
336,CHAIR POWELL,So I think it’s certainly possible that we’ll need to move policy to levels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral.
337,CHAIR POWELL,We can’t know that today.
338,CHAIR POWELL,That decision is not in front of us today.
339,CHAIR POWELL,"If we do conclude that we need to do that, then we won’t hesitate to do it."
340,CHAIR POWELL,"I’ll say again, there’s no bright line, you know, that you’re stepping over."
341,CHAIR POWELL,You’re really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for it.
342,CHAIR POWELL,You’re looking at financial conditions and how that’s affecting the economy and making a judgment.
343,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we won’t be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than the other one."
344,CHAIR POWELL,It’s much more about a practical application of our policy tools.
345,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re absolutely prepared to do that.
346,CHAIR POWELL,It—wouldn’t hesitate if that’s what it takes.
348,CHAIR POWELL,I shouldn’t be singled out in this respect.
349,CHAIR POWELL,But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him.
350,CHAIR POWELL,And I—But I would phrase it this way: He had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing.
351,CHAIR POWELL,That’s what it was.
352,CHAIR POWELL,It wasn’t a particular thing.
353,CHAIR POWELL,It was that he always did—he always did—what he thought was the right thing.
354,CHAIR POWELL,"If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through."
355,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s [what] the test is.
357,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say, we do see, though—we see restoring price stability as absolutely essential for the country in coming years."
358,CHAIR POWELL,"Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anybody, really."
359,CHAIR POWELL,"And so it’s really essential, particularly for the labor market."
360,CHAIR POWELL,"If you think about it, like if you look at the last cycle, we had a very, very—longest expansion cycle in our recorded history."
361,CHAIR POWELL,"In the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to people in the lower quartiles."
362,CHAIR POWELL,"And it was, you know, racial, wealth, and income—not wealth, but income gaps were coming down, wage gaps."
363,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s a really great thing.
364,CHAIR POWELL,We’d all love to get back to that place.
365,CHAIR POWELL,"But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability."
366,CHAIR POWELL,"So, basically, we’ve been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic."
367,CHAIR POWELL,This isn’t anything like regular business.
368,CHAIR POWELL,"This is, we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know, in—since the Depression."
369,CHAIR POWELL,Then we have this outsized response from fiscal policy and monetary policy.
370,CHAIR POWELL,Then we have inflation.
371,CHAIR POWELL,"Then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the commodity, you know, patch in half."
372,CHAIR POWELL,And now we have these shutdowns in China.
373,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years.
374,CHAIR POWELL,So we have to look through that and look at the economy that’s coming out the other side.
375,CHAIR POWELL,And we need to somehow find price stability out of this.
376,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s obviously going to be very challenging, I think, because you do have, you know, numerous supply shocks, which are famously difficult to deal with."
377,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess that’s how I think about it.
386,CHAIR POWELL,"So I didn’t—if I said “necessary,” I meant to say “appropriate.” We’re not going to be erecting a high barrier for this."
387,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s more, if we think it’s appropriate."
388,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the point is, we’re a very long way from neutral now."
389,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re moving there expeditiously, and we’ll continue to do so."
390,CHAIR POWELL,"And we can’t make that decision, really, today."
391,CHAIR POWELL,The decision for about how high to go will be on the table to be made when we reach neutral.
392,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I expect we’ll get there expeditiously, as I’ve mentioned."
393,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s not that we don’t want to—making that decision today wouldn’t really mean anything.
394,CHAIR POWELL,"But I’ll say again, if we do believe that it’s appropriate to go to those levels, we won’t hesitate."
402,CHAIR POWELL,"It was just, pick a date, you know, and that happened to be the date that we picked."
403,CHAIR POWELL,It was—nothing magic about it.
404,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it’s not going to have any macroeconomic significance over time."
405,CHAIR POWELL,We just picked that.
406,CHAIR POWELL,"Sometimes we publish these calendars on the first day of the month, and that’s what we’re doing."
407,CHAIR POWELL,I wouldn’t read anything into it.
408,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stress how uncertain the effect May 4, 2022 is of shrinking the balance sheet."
410,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, these are very uncertain."
411,CHAIR POWELL,I really can’t be any clearer.
412,CHAIR POWELL,There won’t be any clearer [estimates].
413,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, people estimate that, broadly, on the path we’re on—and this will be taken, probably, too seriously—but sort of ¼ percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace."
414,CHAIR POWELL,"But I would just say, with very wide uncertainty bands—very wide."
415,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t really know.
416,CHAIR POWELL,"There are other estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way."
417,CHAIR POWELL,And some of you may read about that.
418,CHAIR POWELL,That’s kind of a mainstream estimate.
419,CHAIR POWELL,"We know that it is part of returning to more normal, more neutral financial conditions."
420,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have, you know, have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy."
421,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of speaking to the American people, so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us, really, that that’s who we work for, and that it’s inflation that people are feeling all over the country."
422,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are working hard on fixing it.
423,CHAIR POWELL,I thought it was quite important to do that.
424,CHAIR POWELL,And so that was really the thinking behind that.
426,CHAIR POWELL,"No, I don’t."
427,CHAIR POWELL,"And a good example of why would be—in the fourth quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year, you saw financial markets reacting, you know, very appropriately."
428,CHAIR POWELL,"Not to bless any particular day’s measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy."
429,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—monetary policy is working through expectations now, to a very large extent."
430,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve only done two rate increases.
431,CHAIR POWELL,"But if May 4, 2022 you look at financial conditions, the two-year [rate] is at 280 [basis points] now."
432,CHAIR POWELL,"In September, I Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL think it was at 20 basis points."
433,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s all through the economy.
434,CHAIR POWELL,People are feeling those higher rates already.
435,CHAIR POWELL,And so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible.
436,CHAIR POWELL,And I think we want to keep it that way.
448,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, so, as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply."
449,CHAIR POWELL,"And what you’re seeing as a result of that is prices going up and at unsustainable levels, levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation."
450,CHAIR POWELL,"And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates: it moves down."
451,CHAIR POWELL,"Interest rates, you know—businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less."
452,CHAIR POWELL,That’s how it works.
453,CHAIR POWELL,"But, ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in balance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation."
454,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, so, yes, there may be some pain associated with getting back to that."
455,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, the big pain over time is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched."
464,CHAIR POWELL,"So, look, I think what you’ve seen is—really, I would say, in the middle of last fall—there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with what the data were saying."
465,CHAIR POWELL,"If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports."
466,CHAIR POWELL,"And inflation—month by month, inflation had come down till September, a few months in a row, stayed low."
467,CHAIR POWELL,"And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that just said, no, this is a much stronger economy."
468,CHAIR POWELL,"And by the way—then, with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year."
469,CHAIR POWELL,But that hadn’t happened yet.
470,CHAIR POWELL,"Anyway, we got an ECI reading—employment compensation, [employment cost] index reading—the Friday before the November meeting."
471,CHAIR POWELL,Then we got a really strong jobs report.
472,CHAIR POWELL,Then we got a really high CPI report.
473,CHAIR POWELL,And so I think it became clear to the Committee that we needed to adjust and adapt.
474,CHAIR POWELL,And we have.
475,CHAIR POWELL,"Ever since then, really ever since then, we’ve been adapting."
476,CHAIR POWELL,"We, you know—the Committee moved by the time of the December meeting to a median [in participants’ 2022 projections] of three rate increases, then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting."
477,CHAIR POWELL,And that process is going on.
478,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s clearly continuing.
479,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s why I say—and I actually mentioned this at the March meeting—that no one should look at any single SEP as sort of a real resting place for 90 days, because we’re in a fast-evolving situation."
480,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s what’s happened.
481,CHAIR POWELL,"You can see—unanimous vote today, of course."
482,CHAIR POWELL,"And I told you the guidance—that broad support on the May 4, 2022 Committee to have 50-basis-point hikes on the table at the next couple of meetings."
483,CHAIR POWELL,So you’re Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL right.
484,CHAIR POWELL,"And by the way, other forecasters have been doing the same thing."
485,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s just us adapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it.
491,CHAIR POWELL,So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit.
492,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s one thing I would say.
493,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s important.
494,CHAIR POWELL,"But the bigger point is this: I do not, at this time, see the two sides of the mandate as in tension."
495,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance."
496,CHAIR POWELL,You can see that there’s a labor shortage.
497,CHAIR POWELL,There aren’t enough people to fill these job openings.
498,CHAIR POWELL,"And companies can’t hire, and wages are moving up at levels that would not, over time, be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time."
499,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, everyone loves to see wages go up."
500,CHAIR POWELL,"And it’s a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level, because these wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation."
501,CHAIR POWELL,"So, what that really means is, to get the kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans, especially the people in the lower-income part of the distribution, especially them."
502,CHAIR POWELL,"To do that, you’ve got to have price stability."
503,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ve got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people’s wages aren’t being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion, too."
504,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s—the good things you can have, as we have."
505,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve had—several of the longest expansions in U.S. history have been in the last 40 years, and that’s May 4, 2022 because it’s been a time of low inflation."
506,CHAIR POWELL,And long expansions are good for people and good for Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the labor market.
507,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s the way I think about it.
508,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we—you know, our tools work."
509,CHAIR POWELL,"We have to think in the, in the medium and longer term."
510,CHAIR POWELL,"And I do think that the best thing for everyone is for us to get back to price stability to support, really, a sustained period of strong labor market conditions."
511,CHAIR POWELL,Thanks very much.
