0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,"Before I go into the details of today’s meeting, I would like to underscore for the American people that we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and that we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the course of the year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy."
3,CHAIR POWELL,"We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt."
4,CHAIR POWELL,"Even so, we have more work to do."
5,CHAIR POWELL,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.
6,CHAIR POWELL,"Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point."
9,CHAIR POWELL,We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
10,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
11,CHAIR POWELL,Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.
12,CHAIR POWELL,I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
13,CHAIR POWELL,The U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year’s rapid pace.
14,CHAIR POWELL,"Although real GDP rose at a pace of 2.9 percent last quarter, it is roughly unchanged through the first three quarters of this year."
15,CHAIR POWELL,Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter.
16,CHAIR POWELL,"Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"Higher interest rates and December 14, 2022 slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"As shown in our Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.5 percent this year and next, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate."
20,CHAIR POWELL,"Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated."
21,CHAIR POWELL,"Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 272,000 jobs per month over the last three months."
22,CHAIR POWELL,"Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers."
23,CHAIR POWELL,The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year.
24,CHAIR POWELL,"FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices."
25,CHAIR POWELL,The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year.
26,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
27,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months ending in October, total PCE prices rose 6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5 percent."
28,CHAIR POWELL,"In November, the 12-month change in the CPI was 7.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent."
29,CHAIR POWELL,The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases.
30,CHAIR POWELL,But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.
31,CHAIR POWELL,Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.
32,CHAIR POWELL,Russia’s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has contributed to upward pressure on inflation.
33,CHAIR POWELL,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is December 14, 2022 5.6 percent this year and falls to 3.1 percent next year, 2.5 percent in 2024, and 2.1 percent in Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL 2025; participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets."
35,CHAIR POWELL,"But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched."
36,CHAIR POWELL,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
37,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
38,CHAIR POWELL,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point, bringing the target range to 4¼ to 4½ percent."
40,CHAIR POWELL,And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.
41,CHAIR POWELL,"With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 4¼ percentage points this year."
42,CHAIR POWELL,We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
43,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the course of the year, financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions."
44,CHAIR POWELL,"Financial conditions fluctuate in the short term in response to many factors, but it is important that, over time, they reflect the policy restraint that we are putting in place to return inflation to 2 percent."
45,CHAIR POWELL,"We are seeing the effects on demand in December 14, 2022 the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing."
46,CHAIR POWELL,"It will take time, however, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
47,CHAIR POWELL,"In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 50 basis points today, a step-down from the 75 basis point pace seen over the previous four meetings."
48,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, 50 basis points is still a historically large increase, and we still have some ways to go."
49,CHAIR POWELL,"As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 5.1 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than projected in September."
50,CHAIR POWELL,"The median projection is 4.1 percent at the end of 2024 and 3.1 percent at the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer-run value."
51,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
52,CHAIR POWELL,Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.
53,CHAIR POWELL,And we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.
54,CHAIR POWELL,We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.
55,CHAIR POWELL,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
56,CHAIR POWELL,Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
57,CHAIR POWELL,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
58,CHAIR POWELL,The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.
59,CHAIR POWELL,We will stay the course until the job is done.
60,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
61,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
62,CHAIR POWELL,"We at the December 14, 2022 Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
63,CHAIR POWELL,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL Thank you.
64,CHAIR POWELL,I will look forward to your questions.
74,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we’re putting in place to bring inflation down to 2 percent."
75,CHAIR POWELL,We think that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year.
76,CHAIR POWELL,But our policy actions work through financial conditions.
77,CHAIR POWELL,"And those, in turn, affect economic activity, the labor market, and inflation."
78,CHAIR POWELL,So what we control is our policy moves in the communications that we make.
79,CHAIR POWELL,"Financial conditions both anticipate, and react to, our actions."
80,CHAIR POWELL,"I would add that our focus is not on short-term moves, but on persistent moves."
81,CHAIR POWELL,"And many, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time."
82,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say it’s our judgment today that we’re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet, which is why we say that we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate."
83,CHAIR POWELL,And I would point you to the SEP again for our current assessment of what that peak level will be.
84,CHAIR POWELL,"As you will have seen, 19 people filled out the SEP this time, and 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5 percent or more—in the 5s."
85,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be.
86,CHAIR POWELL,"You will also know that, at each subsequent SEP during the course of this year, we’ve actually increased our estimate of what that peak rate will be."
87,CHAIR POWELL,"And today we’re—the SEP that was published shows again that, overwhelmingly, FOMC participants believe that inflation risks are to the upside."
88,CHAIR POWELL,So I can’t tell you confidently that we won’t move up our estimate of the peak rate again at the next SEP.
89,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t know what we’ll do.
90,CHAIR POWELL,It will depend on future data.
91,CHAIR POWELL,"What we’re writing down today is our best estimate of what we think that peak rate will be, based on what we know."
92,CHAIR POWELL,"Obviously, if data—if the inflation data come in worse, that could move up."
93,CHAIR POWELL,And it could move down if inflation data are softer.
100,CHAIR POWELL,"So, as I’ve been saying, as we’ve gone through the course of this year, as we lifted off and got into the course of the year and we saw the—how strong inflation was and how persistent, it was very important to move quickly."
101,CHAIR POWELL,"In fact, the speed—the pace with which we’re moving was the most important thing."
102,CHAIR POWELL,"I think now that we’re coming to the end of this year, we’ve raised 425 basis points this year, and we’re into restrictive territory."
103,CHAIR POWELL,It’s now not so important how fast we go.
106,CHAIR POWELL,That will become the most important question.
107,CHAIR POWELL,But I would say the most important question now is no longer the speed.
108,CHAIR POWELL,So—and that applies to February as well.
109,CHAIR POWELL,"So I December 14, 2022 think we’ll make the February decision based on the incoming data and where we see financial Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL conditions, where we see the economy."
110,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’ll be the key thing, but—I mean, for that decision."
111,CHAIR POWELL,"But, ultimately, that question about how high to raise rates is going to be one that we make looking at our progress on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are, and making an assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough."
112,CHAIR POWELL,"[As] I’ve told you today, we have an assessment that we’re not at a restrictive enough stance, even with today’s move."
113,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ve laid out our own—our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there.
114,CHAIR POWELL,"At a certain point, though, we’ll get to that point."
116,CHAIR POWELL,"And there, the strong view on the Committee is that we’ll need to stay there, you know, until we’re really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way."
117,CHAIR POWELL,And we think that that will be some time.
119,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at—you can break inflation down into three, sort of, buckets."
120,CHAIR POWELL,"The first is goods inflation, and we see now, as we’ve been expecting, really, for a year and a half, that supply conditions would get better."
121,CHAIR POWELL,"And, ultimately, supply chains get fixed, and demand settles down a little bit and maybe goes back to services a little bit."
122,CHAIR POWELL,And we start to see goods inflation coming down.
123,CHAIR POWELL,We’re now starting to see that in this report and the last one.
124,CHAIR POWELL,Then you go to housing services.
125,CHAIR POWELL,"We know the story there is that housing services inflation has been very, very high and will continue to go up, actually."
126,CHAIR POWELL,"As rents expire and have to be renewed, they’re going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were when the original leases were signed."
127,CHAIR POWELL,But we see that the new leases that are—that the rate for new leases is coming down.
128,CHAIR POWELL,"So, once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will December 14, 2022 come down sometime next year."
129,CHAIR POWELL,"The third piece, which is something like 55 percent of the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL index, PCE core inflation index, is non-housing-related core services."
130,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s really a function of the labor market, largely."
131,CHAIR POWELL,"The biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor."
132,CHAIR POWELL,"And we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven’t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high."
133,CHAIR POWELL,"Vacancies are quite elevated, and, really, there’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand."
134,CHAIR POWELL,"So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down."
135,CHAIR POWELL,"The other—you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning at all for a year and a half."
136,CHAIR POWELL,Now it seems to be turning.
137,CHAIR POWELL,"But there’s an expectation, really, that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we’ll have to stay at it, so that we may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go."
138,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s really why we are writing down those high rates and why we’re expecting that they’ll have to remain high for a time.
148,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I’ll tell you what the projection is."
149,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t think it would qualify as a recession, though, because you’ve got positive growth."
150,CHAIR POWELL,"The expectations in the SEP are basically as you said, which is, we’ve got growth at a modest level, which is to say that December 14, 2022 ½ percentage point, that’s positive growth."
151,CHAIR POWELL,It’s slow growth.
152,CHAIR POWELL,It’s well below trend.
153,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL going to feel like a boom.
155,CHAIR POWELL,"In that condition, labor market conditions are softening a bit."
156,CHAIR POWELL,Unemployment does go up a bit.
157,CHAIR POWELL,I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually elevated at this moment.
158,CHAIR POWELL,So it’s not clear that those forecasts of inflation are really much above the natural rate of unemployment.
159,CHAIR POWELL,We can never identify its location with great precision.
160,CHAIR POWELL,But that 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market.
161,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look—you know, you’ve got—the reports we get from the field are that companies are very reluctant to lay people off, other than the tech companies, which is, you know, a story unto itself."
162,CHAIR POWELL,"Generally, companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it’s been very, very hard to hire."
163,CHAIR POWELL,So you’ve got all these vacancies out there—far in excess of the number of employed people.
164,CHAIR POWELL,"That doesn’t sound like a—you know, a labor market where a lot of people will need to be put out of work."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"So that we—you know, there are channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe."
166,CHAIR POWELL,"None of that is guaranteed, but that is what their forecast reflects."
174,CHAIR POWELL,So I haven’t made a judgment on what size rate hike to make at the last meeting.
175,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, what you said is broadly right, which is, having moved so quickly and having now so much restraint that’s still in the pipeline, we think that the appropriate thing to do now is to move to a slower pace."
176,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, that will allow us to feel our way and—you know, and get to that level, we think, and better balance the risks that we face."
177,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s the idea.
178,CHAIR POWELL,"It makes a lot of sense, it seems to me—particularly if you consider how far we’ve come."
179,CHAIR POWELL,"But, again, I can’t tell you today what the actual size of that will be."
180,CHAIR POWELL,"It will depend on a variety of factors, including the incoming data in particular, the state of the economy, the state of financial conditions."
182,CHAIR POWELL,No.
183,CHAIR POWELL,Absolutely not.
184,CHAIR POWELL,No.
185,CHAIR POWELL,"As a—just a matter of practice, the SEP reflects any data that’s—that comes out during the meeting."
186,CHAIR POWELL,"And participants know that they have the—they know this—that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, you know, well in advance of the press conference so that we’re not running around."
187,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s not the case.
188,CHAIR POWELL,It’s never the case that the SEPs don’t reflect an important piece of data that came in on the first day of the meeting.
198,CHAIR POWELL,No.
199,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not about the strength of the labor market.
200,CHAIR POWELL,The labor market is clearly very strong.
201,CHAIR POWELL,"It is more just that, you know, by now, we had expected—we’ve continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have, ultimately."
202,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s why the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting.
203,CHAIR POWELL,You see that—you see the fact that we’ve made less progress than expected on inflation.
204,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s why that goes up.
205,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s why unemployment goes up, because we’re having to tighten policy more."
206,CHAIR POWELL,"And so it didn’t go up by much in the meeting, I don’t think."
207,CHAIR POWELL,"But that’s the idea, is slower progress on inflation, tighter policy, probably higher rates probably held for longer just to get to where you—the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent."
209,CHAIR POWELL,It’s very hard to say.
211,CHAIR POWELL,"And history would, you know, would say that, in a situation like this, the declines in unemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there."
213,CHAIR POWELL,"So, I’ll give you a few reasons."
214,CHAIR POWELL,"First just is that there’s this huge overhang of vacancies, meaning that vacancies can come down a fair amount."
215,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re hearing from many companies that they don’t want to lay people off—so that they’ll keep people because it’s been so hard.
216,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I think we’ve—it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there where there are, you know, 4 million fewer people, a little more than 4 million who were in the December 14, 2022 workforce available to work than there’s demand for workforce."
217,CHAIR POWELL,"So the fact that there’s a strong Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL labor market, you know, means that companies will hold on to workers."
218,CHAIR POWELL,"And it means that it may take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less."
219,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, that we’re going to find out empirically."
220,CHAIR POWELL,But I think that’s a reasonably possible outcome.
221,CHAIR POWELL,"And you do hear, you know, many, many labor economists believe that it is."
222,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’ll see, though."
228,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I think that’s why one of the reasons it went up was that core came in stronger this year."
229,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
230,CHAIR POWELL,"What you see is our best estimate, as of today—really, as of today—for how high we need to raise rates to—how much we need to tighten policy to create enough, you know, restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow—soften the labor market and bring inflation down through those channels."
231,CHAIR POWELL,That’s all—that is the estimate—best estimate—we make today.
232,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, we’ll make another estimate for the next SEP. And we’ll, you know, of course, between meetings, we do the same thing, but we don’t publish it."
239,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re actually moving down to—the level that we’re moving down to next year is still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now, well more than 1 percent change in inflation."
240,CHAIR POWELL,But remember that the jump[ing]-off point at the beginning of the year is higher.
241,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, we—we’re moving down still by a very large chunk."
242,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t think it’s having—I don’t think the policy is having any less effect.
243,CHAIR POWELL,It’s just starting from a higher level at the end of 2022.
244,CHAIR POWELL,So we’re getting down.
245,CHAIR POWELL,I believe the median is 3½ percent.
246,CHAIR POWELL,That would be—that’s a pretty significant drop in inflation.
248,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s coming from the goods sector, clearly."
249,CHAIR POWELL,"By the middle of next year, we should begin to see lower inflation from the housing services sector."
251,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, that’s where you need to see—we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in the labor market so that you have—it’s not that we don’t want wage increases."
252,CHAIR POWELL,We want strong wage increases.
253,CHAIR POWELL,We just want them to be at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.
254,CHAIR POWELL,"Right now that—if you put into—if you factor in productivity estimates, standard productivity estimates, wages are running, you know, well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation."
264,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance to one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time."
265,CHAIR POWELL,It’s not on rate cuts.
266,CHAIR POWELL,And we think that we’ll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time.
267,CHAIR POWELL,Historical experience cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.
268,CHAIR POWELL,I guess I would say it this way: I wouldn’t see us considering rate cuts until the Committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent in a sustained way.
269,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s the test I would articulate.
270,CHAIR POWELL,And you’re correct.
271,CHAIR POWELL,There are not rate cuts in the SEP for 2023.
277,CHAIR POWELL,So you’re right.
278,CHAIR POWELL,Those two things will offset each other.
279,CHAIR POWELL,"Weaker output in China will push down on commodity prices, but it could interfere with supply chains ultimately."
280,CHAIR POWELL,And that could push inflation up in the West.
281,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s very hard to say, you know, how much—how those two will offset each other."
282,CHAIR POWELL,"And it doesn’t seem likely, actually, that the overall net effect would be material on us."
283,CHAIR POWELL,"But, to your point, China faces a very challenging situation in reopening."
284,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we’ve seen, waves of COVID all around the world can interfere with economic activity."
285,CHAIR POWELL,"China, a very critical manufacturing—place for manufacturing December 14, 2022 and exporting."
286,CHAIR POWELL,Their supply chain is very important.
287,CHAIR POWELL,And China faces a reopening.
288,CHAIR POWELL,"They’ve— Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL you know, they’ve backed away from their COVID restriction policies."
289,CHAIR POWELL,There could be very significant increases in COVID.
290,CHAIR POWELL,And we’ll just have to see.
291,CHAIR POWELL,It’s a risky situation.
292,CHAIR POWELL,"It—but, again, it doesn’t seem like it’s likely to have material overall effects on us."
302,CHAIR POWELL,Right.
303,CHAIR POWELL,"So the data that we’ve received so far for October and November, we don’t have the—some of the—we have some remaining data to get in November, but they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases."
304,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path."
305,CHAIR POWELL,So the way we think about this is this: This report is very much in line with what we’ve been expecting and hoping for.
306,CHAIR POWELL,"And what it does is, it provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation."
307,CHAIR POWELL,"As I mentioned, we’ve been expecting significant—forecasting significant declines in overall inflation and core inflation in the coming year."
308,CHAIR POWELL,And this is the kind of reading that it will take to support that.
309,CHAIR POWELL,"So, really, this gives us greater confidence in our forecasts rather than, at this point, changing our forecast."
310,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting goods inflation to come down as supply chain pressures eased."
311,CHAIR POWELL,That’s happening now.
312,CHAIR POWELL,"Housing services—as I December 14, 2022 mentioned, there’s good news in the pipeline."
313,CHAIR POWELL,"As long as housing—new housing leases show Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL declining inflation, that will show up in the measure around the middle of next year."
314,CHAIR POWELL,So that should help.
315,CHAIR POWELL,"And the big piece, again, is core services, ex housing, which is very important."
316,CHAIR POWELL,And we have a ways to go there.
317,CHAIR POWELL,You do see some beginning signs there.
318,CHAIR POWELL,"But, ultimately, that’s the big—the more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE core index."
319,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s very fundamentally about the labor market and wages.
320,CHAIR POWELL,"If you look at wages, look at the average hourly earnings number we got with the last payrolls report, you don’t really see much progress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down."
321,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, there may be composition effects and other effects in that."
322,CHAIR POWELL,So we don’t put too much weight on any one report.
323,CHAIR POWELL,These things can be volatile month to month.
324,CHAIR POWELL,"But we will be looking for wages moving, you know, down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and, ultimately, their gains are not being eaten up by inflation."
328,CHAIR POWELL,So if I—I think I got your question.
329,CHAIR POWELL,"So, you know, one thing is to say is, I think our policy’s in—getting into a pretty good place now."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re restrictive, and I think we’re—you know, we’re getting close to that level of sufficient—we think—sufficiently December 14, 2022 restrictive."
331,CHAIR POWELL,We laid out today what our best estimates are to get there.
333,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, we’re—we welcome these better inflation reports for the last two months."
334,CHAIR POWELL,They’re very welcome.
335,CHAIR POWELL,But I think we’re realistic about the broader project.
336,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s all.
337,CHAIR POWELL,That’s the point I would make.
338,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—you know, we see goods prices coming down."
339,CHAIR POWELL,We understand what will happen with housing services.
340,CHAIR POWELL,"But the big story will really be the rest of it, and there’s not much progress there."
341,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s going to take some time.
342,CHAIR POWELL,I think my view and my colleagues’ view is that this will take some time.
343,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained period so that, you know, two good—you know, two good monthly reports are, you know, very welcome."
344,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, they’re very welcome."
345,CHAIR POWELL,"But we need to be honest with ourselves that there’s, you know, inflation—12-month core inflation is 6 percent CPI."
346,CHAIR POWELL,That’s three times our 2 percent target.
347,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, it’s good to see progress."
348,CHAIR POWELL,But let’s just understand we have a long ways to go to get back to price stability.
350,CHAIR POWELL,"No, I wouldn’t say that."
351,CHAIR POWELL,No.
352,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t say that.
353,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I would say this: You know, to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation, you know, moves up higher and higher, I think that narrows the runway."
354,CHAIR POWELL,"But lower inflation readings, if they persist, in time, could certainly make it more possible."
355,CHAIR POWELL,"So I just—I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not and, if we do, whether it’s going to be a deep one or not."
356,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s just, it’s not knowable."
357,CHAIR POWELL,"And certainly, you know, lower inflation reports, were they to continue for a period of time, would increase the likelihood of a—put it this way, of a return to price stability that involves significantly less of an increase in unemployment than would be expected given the historical record."
364,CHAIR POWELL,"So the largest amount of pain—the worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high in terms of employment, meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time, the kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the Fed didn’t respond aggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode, you know, 50 years ago."
365,CHAIR POWELL,So that’s really—the worst pain would be if we failed to act.
366,CHAIR POWELL,"What we’re doing now is, you know, it’s raising interest rates for people."
367,CHAIR POWELL,And so people are paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing.
368,CHAIR POWELL,There will be some softening in labor market conditions.
369,CHAIR POWELL,And I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability.
370,CHAIR POWELL,There isn’t.
371,CHAIR POWELL,And this is the best we can do.
372,CHAIR POWELL,"I do think, though, that—and markets are pretty confident, it seems to me—that we will get inflation under control."
373,CHAIR POWELL,And I believe we will.
374,CHAIR POWELL,We’re certainly highly committed to do that.
381,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s just—so, changing our inflation goal is just something we’re not thinking about, and it’s something we’re not going to think about."
382,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s—we have a 2 percent inflation goal, and we’ll use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent."
383,CHAIR POWELL,I think this isn’t the time to be thinking about that.
384,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, there may be a longer-run project at some point."
385,CHAIR POWELL,But that is not where we are at all.
386,CHAIR POWELL,The Committee—we’re not considering that.
387,CHAIR POWELL,We’re not going to consider that under any circumstances.
388,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to keep our inflation target at 2 percent.
389,CHAIR POWELL,We’re going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent.
395,CHAIR POWELL,"So the—I would go back to the labor market that we had in 2018, ’19, ’20."
396,CHAIR POWELL,"So, what that looked like was, wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the income spectrum were the largest."
397,CHAIR POWELL,The gaps between racial groups and gender groups were at their smallest in recorded history.
398,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s—and all of that because of a tight labor market, a tight labor market which had inflation running, you know, just a tick below 2 percent and the economy growing right at its potential."
399,CHAIR POWELL,"So that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the country, if we could get back to that."
400,CHAIR POWELL,And so that’s what all of us want to do.
401,CHAIR POWELL,"We want to get back to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of December 14, 2022 time."
402,CHAIR POWELL,That’s a really good thing for workers in the economy.
403,CHAIR POWELL,And we’d love to get back to that.
404,CHAIR POWELL,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL That’s what our goal is.
405,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, there’s—in the near term, we have to use our tools to restore price stability."
406,CHAIR POWELL,"But we, you know, we can’t—what we have to think about is the medium and longer term."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"If you think about it, the country went through a difficult time—I think much more difficult than we can think it would happen here."
408,CHAIR POWELL,But it really set up our economy for several decades of prosperity.
409,CHAIR POWELL,"So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of the economy and the people in it over a very, very long period of time."
410,CHAIR POWELL,"And so when it is lost, for whatever reason, it has to be restored and as quickly as possible—which is what we’re doing."
413,CHAIR POWELL,"We do, yes."
414,CHAIR POWELL,We absolutely do.
415,CHAIR POWELL,"We look at—it’s our regular practice to talk about unemployment rates by different groups, including racial groups and that sort of thing."
416,CHAIR POWELL,We do.
417,CHAIR POWELL,We keep our eye on that.
422,CHAIR POWELL,So I don’t want to get into too many hypotheticals.
423,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, we’ll—it’s hard to deal with hypotheticals."
424,CHAIR POWELL,So let me just say that we have to use our tools to support maximum employment and price stability.
425,CHAIR POWELL,"I’ve made it clear that right now, the labor market’s very, very strong."
426,CHAIR POWELL,"You’re near a 50-year low where you’re at or above maximum employment, a 50-year low in unemployment, vacancies are very high, wages—nominal wages December 14, 2022 are very high."
427,CHAIR POWELL,"So the labor market’s very, very strong."
428,CHAIR POWELL,Where we’re missing is on the inflation Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL side.
429,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re missing by a lot on the inflation side.
430,CHAIR POWELL,"So that means we need to really focus on getting inflation under control, and that’s what we’ll do."
431,CHAIR POWELL,"I think, as the economy heals, the two goals come more into play."
432,CHAIR POWELL,"But right now, clearly, the focus has to be on getting inflation down."
441,CHAIR POWELL,"So, what I meant by that, with “structural labor shortage,” is, if you look at where we are now, as I mentioned, there—if you just look at demand for labor, you can look at vacancies plus people who are actually working."
443,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t see—despite very high wages and an incredibly tight labor market, we don’t see participation moving up—which is contrary to what we thought."
444,CHAIR POWELL,"So the upshot of all that is, the labor market is actually—it should—it’s 3½ million people, at least, smaller than it should have been based on pre-pandemic."
445,CHAIR POWELL,Just assume population and reasonable growth and aging of the population; our labor force should be 3½ million more than it is.
446,CHAIR POWELL,And that—there’re lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back a few more years.
448,CHAIR POWELL,Part of it is just accelerated retirements.
449,CHAIR POWELL,People dropped out and aren’t coming back at a higher rate than expected.
450,CHAIR POWELL,"Part of it is that we lost a half a million December 14, 2022 people who would have been work—close to half a million who would have been working died Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL from COVID."
451,CHAIR POWELL,And part of it is that migration has been lower.
452,CHAIR POWELL,"We don’t prescribe—you know, it’s not our job to prescribe things."
453,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, I think if you ask businesses, you know, pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren’t enough people."
454,CHAIR POWELL,We need more people.
455,CHAIR POWELL,"So I tried to identify that in my—in a speech I gave a month ago, but I stopped short of telling Congress what to do because, you know, they gave us a job."
456,CHAIR POWELL,"And we need to, you know, do that job."
463,CHAIR POWELL,No.
464,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, what we do is, we make our forecasts, and we publish them quarterly."
465,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, if you look at those forecasts, those are forecasts for slow growth, for a softening labor market, by which I mean, unemployment goes up but not a great deal."
466,CHAIR POWELL,And you see inflation coming down.
467,CHAIR POWELL,You see rates going up a lot.
468,CHAIR POWELL,You see inflation coming down.
469,CHAIR POWELL,"Those are those forecasts, and that’s really what they show."
470,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re not—of course, we don’t talk about, you know, this kind of a recession and that kind of a recession."
471,CHAIR POWELL,"We just, you know, we make those forecasts."
472,CHAIR POWELL,"The staff runs—and you will see this if you look at the old Tealbooks—runs alternative simulations of all different kinds at every meeting, and we look at those, too."
473,CHAIR POWELL,And those will explore different things.
474,CHAIR POWELL,"But that’s just, you know, upside and downside scenarios."
475,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, that’s a responsible practice that December 14, 2022 we’ve carried on for many decades."
476,CHAIR POWELL,"But, no, we don’t—we haven’t asked ourselves that Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL question."
484,CHAIR POWELL,So we do know that.
485,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, that’s something that we know we’d see."
486,CHAIR POWELL,"But, as I mentioned, you know, we wouldn’t—I wouldn’t see the Committee cutting rates until we’re confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way."
487,CHAIR POWELL,That would be my test.
488,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t see us as having a really clear and precise understanding of what the neutral rate is and what real rates are so that it would mechanically happen like that.
490,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you very much.
