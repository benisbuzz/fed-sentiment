0,CHAIR POWELL,Good afternoon.
1,CHAIR POWELL,"Before discussing today’s meeting, let me comment briefly on recent developments in the banking sector."
2,CHAIR POWELL,"Conditions in that sector have broadly improved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient."
3,CHAIR POWELL,We will continue to monitor conditions in the sector.
4,CHAIR POWELL,We are committed to learning the right lessons from this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again.
5,CHAIR POWELL,"As a first step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr’s Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank."
6,CHAIR POWELL,"The review’s findings underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system, and I am confident that we will do so."
7,CHAIR POWELL,"From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people."
8,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
9,CHAIR POWELL,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.
10,CHAIR POWELL,"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone."
11,CHAIR POWELL,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
12,CHAIR POWELL,"Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point."
13,CHAIR POWELL,"Since early last year, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time."
14,CHAIR POWELL,We are also continuing to reduce our securities holdings.
15,CHAIR POWELL,"Looking ahead, we will take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate."
16,CHAIR POWELL,"I will May 3, 2023 have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL developments."
17,CHAIR POWELL,"The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend pace of 0.9 percent."
18,CHAIR POWELL,"The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be modest, at 1.1 percent, despite a pickup in consumer spending."
19,CHAIR POWELL,"Activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage, mortgage rates."
20,CHAIR POWELL,Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
21,CHAIR POWELL,The labor market remains very tight.
22,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the first three months of the year, job gains averaged 345,000 jobs per month."
23,CHAIR POWELL,"The unemployment rate remained very low in March, at 3.5 percent."
24,CHAIR POWELL,"Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming back into better balance."
25,CHAIR POWELL,"The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years."
26,CHAIR POWELL,"Nominal wage growth has sown—shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
27,CHAIR POWELL,"But overall, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers."
28,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
29,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent."
30,CHAIR POWELL,Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.
31,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go."
32,CHAIR POWELL,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
33,CHAIR POWELL,"The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by, by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people."
34,CHAIR POWELL,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware May 3, 2023 that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
35,CHAIR POWELL,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation pose—poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
36,CHAIR POWELL,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5¼ percent."
37,CHAIR POWELL,And we’re continuing to [carry out] the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.
38,CHAIR POWELL,"With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more than a year."
39,CHAIR POWELL,"We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment."
40,CHAIR POWELL,"It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
41,CHAIR POWELL,"In addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit conditions."
42,CHAIR POWELL,Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to our policy actions and a softer economic outlook.
43,CHAIR POWELL,But the strains that emerged in the banking sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and businesses.
44,CHAIR POWELL,"In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
45,CHAIR POWELL,The extent of these effects remains uncertain.
46,CHAIR POWELL,"In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with the monetary policy restraint we have put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold."
47,CHAIR POWELL,"In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
48,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we will make that determination meeting by meeting, based on the totality of May 3, 2023 incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
49,CHAIR POWELL,And we Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted.
50,CHAIR POWELL,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
51,CHAIR POWELL,Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
52,CHAIR POWELL,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
53,CHAIR POWELL,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
54,CHAIR POWELL,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
55,CHAIR POWELL,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
56,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
57,CHAIR POWELL,I look forward to your questions.
65,CHAIR POWELL,"So, taking your question—of course, today our decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points."
66,CHAIR POWELL,"A, a decision on a pause was not made today."
67,CHAIR POWELL,"You will have noticed that in the—in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate."
68,CHAIR POWELL,"That sentence is, is not in, in the statement anymore."
69,CHAIR POWELL,"We took that out, and instead we’re saying that, in May 3, 2023 determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account certain factors."
70,CHAIR POWELL,So we—that’s a—that’s a meaningful change that we’re no longer saying that we anticipate.
71,CHAIR POWELL,And so we’ll be driven by incoming data meeting by meeting.
72,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’ll approach that question at the June meeting."
73,CHAIR POWELL,"So the—the staff’s forecast is—so let me say—start by saying that that’s not my own most likely case, which is really that, that the economy will continue to grow at, at a modest rate this year."
74,CHAIR POWELL,And I think that’s—so different people on the Committee have different forecasts.
75,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s my own assessment of the most likely path."
76,CHAIR POWELL,"[The] staff produces its own forecast, and it’s independent of the forecasts of, of the participants, which include the Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course."
77,CHAIR POWELL,"And we think this is a healthy thing—that the, the staff is writing down what they really think."
78,CHAIR POWELL,"They’re not especially influenced by what the Governors think, and vice versa."
79,CHAIR POWELL,The Governors are not taking what the staff says and just writing that down.
80,CHAIR POWELL,"So it’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can have different perspectives."
81,CHAIR POWELL,"So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, and by that I would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is—has been typical in modern-era recessions."
82,CHAIR POWELL,I wouldn’t want to characterize the staff’s forecast for this meeting.
83,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ll, we’ll leave that to the minutes—but broadly, broadly similar to that."
91,CHAIR POWELL,"So I wouldn’t want to speculate specifically, but I will say this: These are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they’re, they’re for Congress and the Administration—for the elected parts of the government to deal with."
92,CHAIR POWELL,And they’re really consigned to them.
93,CHAIR POWELL,"From our standpoint, I would just say this: It’s essential that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely way, so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they’re due."
94,CHAIR POWELL,A failure to do that would be unprecedented.
95,CHAIR POWELL,"We’d be in uncharted territory, and the—and the consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite a[d]verse."
96,CHAIR POWELL,So I’ll just leave it there.
97,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we don’t give advice to either side."
98,CHAIR POWELL,We just would point out that it—that it’s very important that this be done.
99,CHAIR POWELL,"And the, the other point I’ll make about that, though, is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the potential, you know, short- and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time."
100,CHAIR POWELL,"We, we—it’s, it would be so uncertain that it’s just as important that, that this—we never get to a place where we’re actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government’s not paying its bills."
103,CHAIR POWELL,I wouldn’t say that it did.
104,CHAIR POWELL,"It was—of course, it’s something that came up."
105,CHAIR POWELL,"We talk a lot about risks to the—to the outlook, and that will—that come up."
106,CHAIR POWELL,A number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook.
107,CHAIR POWELL,I wouldn’t say that it was important in today’s monetary policy decision.
115,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
116,CHAIR POWELL,So the February 14 presentation—I didn’t remember it very well.
117,CHAIR POWELL,"But now, of course, I’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully."
118,CHAIR POWELL,I did remember it.
119,CHAIR POWELL,And what it was was a general presentation.
120,CHAIR POWELL,It was an informational briefing of the whole Board—the entire Board.
121,CHAIR POWELL,I think all members were there.
122,CHAIR POWELL,"And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and, and lots of data."
123,CHAIR POWELL,"And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank, which talked about, you know, the amount of losses they—or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio."
124,CHAIR POWELL,"There was nothing in it about—that I recall, anyway, about, about the risk of a bank run."
125,CHAIR POWELL,"So it was—I think the takeaway was, they were going away to do a—an assessment, a vertical—sorry, horizontal assessment of, of banks."
126,CHAIR POWELL,"It wasn’t—it, it wasn’t presented as an urgent or alarming situation."
127,CHAIR POWELL,"It was presented as a—as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing."
128,CHAIR POWELL,"And I thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it."
129,CHAIR POWELL,"In terms of what we’re doing—of course, I think banks themselves are, are—many, many banks are now, are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since, since the events of, of early March, to build liquidity."
130,CHAIR POWELL,And you asked about the separation principle.
131,CHAIR POWELL,"I—you know, like so many things, it, it’s very useful."
132,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits."
133,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict."
134,CHAIR POWELL,They’re both—they’re working well together.
135,CHAIR POWELL,"We’ve used our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities."
136,CHAIR POWELL,"And, at the May 3, 2023 same time, we’ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and price stability."
146,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I mean, I didn’t say it wasn’t alarming."
147,CHAIR POWELL,"It was—they’re pointing out something that they’re working on and that they’re on the case—that, that, you know, that—I’m not sure whether they mentioned—I think they did, actually."
148,CHAIR POWELL,They mentioned that they had taken regulatory action matter—or supervisory action in the form of matters requiring attention.
149,CHAIR POWELL,So I think that was also in the presentation.
150,CHAIR POWELL,"I think it was to say: Yes, this is a bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this—these things, and we’re on the case."
155,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, you know, we certainly don’t—and I don’t have an agenda to further consolidate banks."
156,CHAIR POWELL,There’s been—consolidation has been a factor in the U.S. banking industry really since interstate banking and before that even—it goes back more than 30 years.
157,CHAIR POWELL,"You—when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks."
158,CHAIR POWELL,"Now there May 3, 2023 are 4,000 and change."
159,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s, that’s going on."
160,CHAIR POWELL,"I personally have long felt that having small-, Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL medium-, and large-size banks is a, a great part of our banking system."
161,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, the community banks serve particular customers very well; regional banks serve very important purposes, and the various kinds of G-SIBs do as well."
162,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think it’s healthy to have a, you know, an arrange—a range of different kinds of banks doing different things."
163,CHAIR POWELL,I think that’s a positive thing.
164,CHAIR POWELL,"Is it a financial—so I would just say, in terms of J.P. Morgan buying First Republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely."
165,CHAIR POWELL,"That, that is their role, so I really don’t have a comment on, on that process."
166,CHAIR POWELL,"As you know, there’s an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank."
167,CHAIR POWELL,So it was legitimate.
168,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think the FDIC, I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least-cost bid."
169,CHAIR POWELL,So I would assume that’s what they did.
171,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, I think it’s probably good policy that we, we don’t want the largest banks doing big acquisitions."
172,CHAIR POWELL,That is the policy.
173,CHAIR POWELL,And—but this is—this is an exception for a failing bank.
174,CHAIR POWELL,"And I, I think it’s actually a good outcome for the banking system."
175,CHAIR POWELL,"It also would have—would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the regional banks bought, bought this company."
176,CHAIR POWELL,And that could have been the outcome.
177,CHAIR POWELL,"But, ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost bid."
183,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
184,CHAIR POWELL,"I think—I think I follow that up by saying, it’s, it’s quite impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect."
185,CHAIR POWELL,"But, in principle, that’s the idea."
186,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, when we—we’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the price of credit, and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism."
187,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tighter in a kind of broadly similar way."
188,CHAIR POWELL,"It isn’t—it isn’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one and the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we’re trying it."
189,CHAIR POWELL,"But, ultimately, we have to be—we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment."
190,CHAIR POWELL,"So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance."
191,CHAIR POWELL,"But I think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates—in principle, we won’t have to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened."
192,CHAIR POWELL,"The extent of that is so hard to predict because we don’t know how persistent these, these effects will be."
193,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know how large they’ll be and how long they’ll take to be transmitted.
194,CHAIR POWELL,"But that’s, that’s what we’ll be watching carefully to find out."
196,CHAIR POWELL,It’s that—this is just something that we have to factor in as we—as we want to find ourselves.
197,CHAIR POWELL,"So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of, of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by meeting, and we’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that—they’re listed in, in May 3, 2023 the statement, the obvious factors."
198,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s, that’s the way we’re going to be thinking about it."
199,CHAIR POWELL,Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL And that’s really all we can do.
200,CHAIR POWELL,"As I say, it does complicate—we, we have, you know, a broad understanding of monetary policy."
201,CHAIR POWELL,Credit tightening is a different thing.
202,CHAIR POWELL,There’s a lot of literature on that.
203,CHAIR POWELL,"But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let’s say—it adds even further uncertainty."
204,CHAIR POWELL,"Nonetheless, we’ll be able to see what’s happening with credit conditions—what’s happening with lending."
205,CHAIR POWELL,We get—there’s a lot of data on that.
206,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we’ll, we’ll factor that into our decisionmaking."
211,CHAIR POWELL,That’s going to be an ongoing assessment.
212,CHAIR POWELL,"We’re going to need data to accumulate on that—not an assessment that we’ve made, as—that, that would mean we think we’ve reached that point."
213,CHAIR POWELL,"And I just think it’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now."
214,CHAIR POWELL,"But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March meeting showed that in—at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was—this was the appropriate level of the—of the ultimate high level of rates."
215,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t know that.
216,CHAIR POWELL,We’ll revisit that at the June meeting.
217,CHAIR POWELL,"And that’s—you know, we’re just going to have to—before we really declare that, I think we’re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you know, make that—as I mentioned, it’s an ongoing assessment."
222,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in line with our usual time frame."
223,CHAIR POWELL,"And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent, when you see it, with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we’re seeing from other sources."
224,CHAIR POWELL,You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls that indicate that midsize banks have—some of them had been tightening their lending standards.
225,CHAIR POWELL,"Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year."
232,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, we—the reason is that we—again, with our monetary policy we’re try—trying to reach and then—and then stay at a, for an extended period, a level of policy—a policy stance that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
233,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, that’s what we’re trying to do with our—with our tool."
234,CHAIR POWELL,I think slowing down was the right move.
235,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I think it’s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do May 3, 2023 so."
236,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, I—you know, we really—you know, we have to balance."
237,CHAIR POWELL,"We always have to balance Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of maybe slowing down economic activity too much."
238,CHAIR POWELL,"And we thought that this rate hike, along with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that."
241,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
242,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment will be an ongoing one."
243,CHAIR POWELL,"You—you know, you can’t—with, with economic data, you, you can’t—you’ve, you’ve seen—take inflation for a minute."
244,CHAIR POWELL,"Look, look back."
245,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve seen inflation come down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021.
246,CHAIR POWELL,We’ve seen inflation have a few months of coming down and then come right back up.
247,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think you’re going to want to see that—you know, that a few months of data will, will persuade you that you’ve—that you’ve got this right, kind of thing."
248,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We’ve raised 500 basis points."
249,CHAIR POWELL,I think that policy is tight.
250,CHAIR POWELL,I think real rates are probably—that you can calculate them many different ways.
251,CHAIR POWELL,"But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a, a reasonable estimate of, of, let’s say, one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent."
252,CHAIR POWELL,So you’ve got 2 percent real rates.
253,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people, anyway, would, would assess as, you know, the neutral rate."
254,CHAIR POWELL,So policy is tight.
255,CHAIR POWELL,And you see that in interest—interest-sensitive activities.
256,CHAIR POWELL,"And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities."
257,CHAIR POWELL,"And if you—if you put the—you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that’s, that’s May 3, 2023 ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we’re, we may not be far off—we’re possibly Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL even at—that level."
262,CHAIR POWELL,"Look—I think we’re always going to have 2 percent as our, our target."
263,CHAIR POWELL,We’re always going to be focusing on getting there.
265,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it’s—let me just say, that’s not what we’re looking for."
266,CHAIR POWELL,We’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time.
267,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, we—that’s, that’s not a question that’s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things."
268,CHAIR POWELL,"But, ultimately, we’re not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools."
269,CHAIR POWELL,"We have a, a goal of getting to 2 percent."
270,CHAIR POWELL,We think it’s going to take some time.
271,CHAIR POWELL,We don’t think it’ll be a smooth process.
272,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, I think we’re going to—we’re going to need to stay at this for a while."
274,CHAIR POWELL,"I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at that point."
275,CHAIR POWELL,"Right now, you have a labor market that’s still extraordinarily tight."
276,CHAIR POWELL,"You still got 1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number, for every unemployed person."
277,CHAIR POWELL,We do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions.
278,CHAIR POWELL,"But, overall, you’re near a 50-year low in unemployment."
279,CHAIR POWELL,"Wages—you all will have seen that the wage number from late May 3, 2023 last week, and it’s—whenever it was."
280,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, it’s, it’s a couple of percentage points Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL above what would be—what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time."
281,CHAIR POWELL,So we do see some softening; we see new labor supply coming in.
282,CHAIR POWELL,These are very positive developments.
283,CHAIR POWELL,"But the labor market is very, very strong, whereas inflation is, you know, running high—well above our—well above our goal."
284,CHAIR POWELL,"And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down."
285,CHAIR POWELL,"Fortunately, we’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up."
291,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
292,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t think—you know, I know what’s printed in the Summary of Economic Projections and all that."
293,CHAIR POWELL,"I don’t think you can deduce exactly what you said about what participants think, because you don’t know what they were thinking for first-quarter GDP at that point."
294,CHAIR POWELL,They could have been thinking about a fairly low number.
295,CHAIR POWELL,"Anyway, in any case, I’ll just say, I, I continue to think that it’s possible that this time is really different."
296,CHAIR POWELL,"And the reason is, there’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market."
297,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s interesting, as, you know, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the unemployment rate is 3½ percent, pretty much where it was—even lower than where it was when we started."
298,CHAIR POWELL,"So job openings are still very, very high."
299,CHAIR POWELL,"We see—by surveys and much, May 3, 2023 much [other] evidence—that, that conditions are cooling gradually."
300,CHAIR POWELL,But it’s—it really is Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL different.
301,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it wasn’t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of the—as they’ve declined without unemployment going up."
302,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, that’s what we’ve seen."
303,CHAIR POWELL,So we—there are no promises in this.
304,CHAIR POWELL,"But it just seems that, to me, that it’s possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes."
305,CHAIR POWELL,"Now, that would be against history."
306,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I fully appreciate that."
307,CHAIR POWELL,"That would be against the, the pattern."
308,CHAIR POWELL,"But I do think that it—that this, that the situation in the labor market, with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are actually—wages have been moving down."
309,CHAIR POWELL,"Wage increases have been moving down, and that’s a good sign—down to a more sustainable level."
310,CHAIR POWELL,So I think that—I think it’s still possible.
311,CHAIR POWELL,"I—you know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than that of having, having a recession."
312,CHAIR POWELL,"But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession is—I don’t rule that out, either."
313,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession."
317,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
318,CHAIR POWELL,"So we look at a range of wage, wage measures."
319,CHAIR POWELL,And then that’s in nominal.
320,CHAIR POWELL,And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases plus inflation.
321,CHAIR POWELL,"And so you can—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta wage tracker, compensation per hour—basically, those four and many others."
322,CHAIR POWELL,"And you can—you can look at, at what the—what they would have to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation."
323,CHAIR POWELL,"They can May 3, 2023 deviate."
324,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, corporate margins can go up and down."
325,CHAIR POWELL,"And there is a feature of long Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL expansions where they do go down—where labor gets a bigger share toward later, later in a recession—sorry, later in an expansion."
326,CHAIR POWELL,"So, yeah."
327,CHAIR POWELL,"The, the—you know, and we calculate those, and you have to take the precision with a degree of—a degree of salt."
328,CHAIR POWELL,"But I would say that what they will show is that, you know, if, if the—if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer to where they need to be."
329,CHAIR POWELL,"Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take to get—to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time."
330,CHAIR POWELL,"I—by the way, I don’t want to—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation."
331,CHAIR POWELL,You’re asking me a very specific question.
332,CHAIR POWELL,I think there are many things.
333,CHAIR POWELL,I think wages and prices tend to move together.
334,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s very hard to say what’s causing what.
335,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, I’ve never said that, you know, that—that wages are really the principal driver, because I don’t think that’s really right."
343,CHAIR POWELL,"So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you have an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply."
344,CHAIR POWELL,"And we’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where, where supply has been fixed or, or not flexible enough."
345,CHAIR POWELL,"And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices."
346,CHAIR POWELL,"So to get, I, I think—as goods pipelines have, have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we May 3, 2023 don’t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing—I think you will see inflation Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL come down."
347,CHAIR POWELL,"And you’ll see—you’ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of full competition, where there’s enough supply to meet demand."
348,CHAIR POWELL,"And then it’s—then it’s, then you’re really back to full competition."
349,CHAIR POWELL,That’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.
356,CHAIR POWELL,I didn’t catch the last part.
360,CHAIR POWELL,"Oh, yes."
361,CHAIR POWELL,"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
362,CHAIR POWELL,"Okay, I got it."
364,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts."
365,CHAIR POWELL,"Of course, the whole idea is to—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data."
366,CHAIR POWELL,"So we’re always, always looking at both."
367,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, and it will—of course, it’ll be the obvious things."
368,CHAIR POWELL,It’ll be readings on inflation.
369,CHAIR POWELL,"It’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of those many things."
372,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy."
373,CHAIR POWELL,"That’ll, that’ll be an important thing."
374,CHAIR POWELL,"I just—you know, we’ll be looking at everything."
375,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s— May 3, 2023 again, I would just point out, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points."
376,CHAIR POWELL,We are shrinking the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL balance sheet.
377,CHAIR POWELL,"And now we have credit conditions tightening—not just in the normal way, but perhaps a little bit more, due to what’s happened."
378,CHAIR POWELL,"And we have to factor all of that in and, and make our assessment of—you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive."
379,CHAIR POWELL,And we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags.
380,CHAIR POWELL,So this is challenging.
381,CHAIR POWELL,"But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that’s what we think."
383,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
384,CHAIR POWELL,"So we on the Committee have a—have a view that inflation is going to come down—not so quickly, but it’ll take some time."
385,CHAIR POWELL,"And in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and—to cut rates, and we won’t cut rates."
386,CHAIR POWELL,"If you have a different forecast and, you know, markets—or have been, from time to time, pricing in, you know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we’d, we’d factor that in."
387,CHAIR POWELL,But that’s not our forecast.
388,CHAIR POWELL,"And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down."
389,CHAIR POWELL,"Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn’t moved much."
390,CHAIR POWELL,And it’s quite stable.
391,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, so we think we’ll have to—demand will have to weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions, conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there."
392,CHAIR POWELL,"And, again, in that world, it wouldn’t be—it wouldn’t be appropriate for us to cut rates."
400,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
401,CHAIR POWELL,"So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine."
402,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, the—it’s, it’s really not contributing, we don’t think, now."
403,CHAIR POWELL,It hasn’t actually been growing.
404,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was."
405,CHAIR POWELL,"What happened in the—when, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have really stabilized now—what happened was, institutional investors took their uninsured deposits and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home Loan Banks and things like that."
406,CHAIR POWELL,"Over the course of, of maybe the last year, retail investors had been gradual—as they do in every tightening cycle, they’ve been gradually moving their deposits into higher-yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds."
407,CHAIR POWELL,"So that’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a, a tightening cycle."
408,CHAIR POWELL,"What was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around and things like that."
409,CHAIR POWELL,But it doesn’t seem to have had any—any effect overall on the overnight repo facility.
410,CHAIR POWELL,"That is really there to, to help us keep rates where they’re supposed to be, and it’s, it’s serving that purpose very well."
415,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
416,CHAIR POWELL,"I would just say, it’s —I, I don’t really think we should be—we shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the U.S. doesn’t pay its bills."
417,CHAIR POWELL,"It just—it just May 3, 2023 shouldn’t be a thing."
418,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and again, I would just say, we don’t—no one should assume that the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL Fed can do—can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally from, from the damage that such, such an event might inflict."
425,CHAIR POWELL,"So I, I didn’t—I didn’t take part in creating the report or doing the work, but I do—I have read it, of course."
426,CHAIR POWELL,And I find it persuasive.
427,CHAIR POWELL,"I mean, I would say it this way: A, a very large—a large bank, not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system."
428,CHAIR POWELL,"I think the only thing that, that I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened, and, and identify what we need to do to address that."
429,CHAIR POWELL,"Some of that is—may, it may just have been technology evolving."
430,CHAIR POWELL,"You know, we have to keep up with all that."
431,CHAIR POWELL,"But some of it may be our policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever."
432,CHAIR POWELL,"What our job is now is, identify those things and implement them."
433,CHAIR POWELL,And that’s kind of the only thing I care about is—and I think—I feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens.
440,CHAIR POWELL,So I guess I would—I guess I would say it this way.
441,CHAIR POWELL,"There were three large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we—that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress."
442,CHAIR POWELL,"Those have now all been resolved, and all the depositors have been protected."
443,CHAIR POWELL,"I think that the resolution and sale of, of First Republic kind of draws a line under that period of—is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of, of severe stress."
444,CHAIR POWELL,Okay.
445,CHAIR POWELL,"I also think we are very focused on what’s happening with credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the—in the Beige Book, and you will see in the SLOOS, is, is small and medium—medium-sized, small and medium-sized banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards—build liquidity."
447,CHAIR POWELL,"More broadly, we, we will continue to very carefully monitor what’s going on in the banking system, and we’ll factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way, going forward."
456,CHAIR POWELL,Sure.
457,CHAIR POWELL,"So let me say, first of all, I’ve been Chair of the Board for five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes."
458,CHAIR POWELL,"I think we’ve learned some May 3, 2023 new things as well, and we need to do better."
459,CHAIR POWELL,"And, as I mentioned, I thought the report was Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL unflinching and appropriately so."
460,CHAIR POWELL,I welcome it.
461,CHAIR POWELL,And I agree with and will support those recommendations.
462,CHAIR POWELL,And I do feel that I’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster measures that will address the problems.
463,CHAIR POWELL,"So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know, the place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual."
464,CHAIR POWELL,"The Vice Chair, it says, shall deploy policy recommendations—“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution ."
465,CHAIR POWELL,.
466,CHAIR POWELL,.
467,CHAIR POWELL,companies .
468,CHAIR POWELL,.
469,CHAIR POWELL,.
470,CHAIR POWELL,", and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms.” So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for someone else on the Board—not, not the Chair—as Vice Chair for Supervision who really gets to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors."
471,CHAIR POWELL,Congress wanted that person to be—to have political accountability for developing that agenda.
472,CHAIR POWELL,"So the way it works—the way it has worked in practice for me is, I’ve had a good working relationship."
473,CHAIR POWELL,"I give my, my counsel, my input privately, and that’s—I offer that."
474,CHAIR POWELL,"And I have good conversations, and I try to contribute constructively."
475,CHAIR POWELL,"I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that person, including working with, with Vice Chair Barr and, and his predecessor."
476,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think that’s the way it’s supposed to work, and that’s appropriate."
477,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I believe that’s what the law requires."
478,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know—but, but it isn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s a matter of complete deference."
479,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s more, I have a—I have a role in, in presenting my views and discussing—having an intelligent discussion about what’s going on and why."
480,CHAIR POWELL,"And, you know, that’s, that’s my input."
481,CHAIR POWELL,"But, ultimately, that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of Governors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision."
484,CHAIR POWELL,"I’ve had a few, sure."
486,CHAIR POWELL,"But, honestly, you don’t—you don’t get to do that."
487,CHAIR POWELL,"Again, my focus is on what—control the controllable."
488,CHAIR POWELL,"As one of my great mentors used to always say, “Control the controllable.” What we control now is, make a fair assessment, learn the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them."
489,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and I think that, that Vice Chair Barr’s report is an excellent first step in that, but we’ve got to follow through."
494,CHAIR POWELL,So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across the board.
495,CHAIR POWELL,"I would say there are a number of people—and, you know, you’ll see this in the minutes."
496,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t want to try to do the head count in real time.
497,CHAIR POWELL,"But people did talk about pausing, but not so much at this meeting, you know, that we’re—I mean, there’s a sense that we’re, we’re—that, you know, we’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that—you know, as I mentioned, if you—if you add up all the tightening that’s going on through various channels, it’s—we, we feel like we—you know, we’re getting close or, or maybe even there."
498,CHAIR POWELL,"But that, again, that’s going to be an ongoing assessment."
499,CHAIR POWELL,"And, and we’re going to be looking at those factors that we listed and—to determine whether there’s, there’s more to do."
502,CHAIR POWELL,I don’t want to—I couldn’t—I couldn’t really say.
503,CHAIR POWELL,"I just think we’re—I think we—look, I think we’ve moved a long way fairly quickly."
504,CHAIR POWELL,"And I think we can afford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment."
510,CHAIR POWELL,"Well, I just would start with something that’s changed, really, which is this—the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through history."
511,CHAIR POWELL,And that now needs to be reflected in some—in some way in regulation and in supervision.
512,CHAIR POWELL,"It—we know—now that we know it’s possible, I think we didn’t—no one thought that was possible."
513,CHAIR POWELL,No one—I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite so quickly.
514,CHAIR POWELL,"So I think that, you know, that will play through."
515,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I, you know—it will be up to Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that."
516,CHAIR POWELL,But I think—I think that’s one thing.
517,CHAIR POWELL,"I, I guess I would just say that."
518,CHAIR POWELL,"Then, you know—that we’re going to—obviously, we’re going to revisit [this]."
519,CHAIR POWELL,"It’s pretty clear we need—to me, anyways—clear that we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size."
520,CHAIR POWELL,"And I’m, I’m thinking that we’re on the—on track to do that as well."
522,CHAIR POWELL,Yeah.
523,CHAIR POWELL,"That’s—see, that’s, that’s what Vice Chair Barr’s role really is, and he’ll take the lead on that."
524,CHAIR POWELL,Thank you.
