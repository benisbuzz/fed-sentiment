7,"First, if, as projected, core PCE inflation this year does come in at, or certainly above, 3 percent, I will consider that much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.",1,1
8,"Their key finding, illustrated in figure 3, is that Federal Reserve policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas U.S. policy rate changes attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions.",2,2
9,"Indeed, an oft-quoted quip by economist Robert Solow held that, as of the late 1980s, ""computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.",2,2
10,"However, I can provide you with some insight into the way the FOMC functions and the impact of monetary policy on the U.S. and global economies.",2,2
11,"Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial market implications, in the twenty-first century when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?",2,2
12,"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",1,1
13,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).",1,2
14,"Indeed, given the externalities involved, it seems plausible that a monopoly central bank that issued fiat money would not respond optimally to crises (it would charge too much for liquidity) or to cyclical variations (it would be maximizing the present discounted value of its seigniorage income rather than minimizing some weighted sum of discounted inflation and output losses).",2,2
15,"Today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising investment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally.",1,1
16,A second question is whether moving in this direction would matter much for the conduct of monetary policy in the United States.,2,2

Clarida At the Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.",0,2
24,"In addition, though the unemployment rate has fallen since the middle of 2003, the participation rate currently remains near the low point reached in the first half of 2004.",1,0

28,The International Monetary Fund projects that global economic growth in 2019 will be the slowest since the financial crisis.,0,0
29,"In terms of the performance of inflation and unemployment, the experience of the past few years has not been unlike a mirror image of the 1970s.",2,2
30,"With tight labor markets and little slack in product markets, we are led to conclude that significant persistent strength in the growth of nominal demand for goods and services, outstripping the likely rate of increase in capacity, will presumably be resisted by higher market interest rates.",1,1
31,"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.",0,2
32,"The rationale for monetary policy tightening is, in my judgment, quite straightforward and flows from two assessments about the current state of the economy.",1,1
33,This automatically pushes up domestic interest rates to support the currency.,1,1
34,"I would like to address two aspects of the issue of underemployment of minorities: first, the implications of ignoring the potential that already exists and, second, the need to encourage young people to seek the types of education and training that will meet the demands of work in the twenty-first century.",0,0
35,"In the past, a reasonable goal might have been to maintain a zero deficit in our on-budget accounts--those accounts that exclude the Social Security and Medicare surplus--and to begin a serious discussion of reforms to Social Security and Medicare to bring them closer into actuarial balance.",2,1
36,A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9 Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review.,2,2
37,"These interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 However, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity.",2,2
38,"Yet, with a few exceptions, the available data show that productivity growth in other advanced countries has not increased to the extent seen in the United States.",0,2
39,"The strength in corporate profits in the first quarter not only impressed economists, but it also impressed investors, who drove stock prices up earlier this year.",2,1

43,Implications for Monetary Policy The period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face today.,2,2
44,The increase in upside risks to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign risks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had been for the preceding two years.,2,1
45,This change has led many governments to be more willing to adopt institutional changes to improve central bank governance that have bolstered central bank credibility for maintaining low inflation.,1,1

52,"Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent, although Venezuela provides one counterexample, with a long-term inflation forecast now of 15 percent.",2,2
53,"Rather than rely on Fed watchers employed by primary dealers to read the tea leaves of our daily interventions, we inform everyone, openly, and take responsibility for the level of short-term interest rates.",2,2
54,"Although the Fed hasn't started raising rates or reducing the balance sheet, interest rates have moved up notably.",1,1
55,"First, there is a tug of war between the continued exceptional momentum in private domestic demand and the external drag from the Asian crisis.",2,2
56,This is an example of offsetting the attenuation in the response to the output gap with a more aggressive response to inflation realizations.,1,1
57,Inflation averaging doesn't define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some value of elevated inflation should be tolerated.,1,1
58,"Palmer was a professor at Wharton, a fellow of the American Statistical Association, a worldwide expert on manpower and labor mobility, and a consultant with the Office of Statistical Standards.5 She argued that ""a single figure of unemployment, regardless of how it is defined or derived, is inadequate as a basis for selection among [policy] programs.",2,2

64,Many have observed the rise in the real federal funds rate to a level well above its historical average and concluded that monetary policy is currently restrictive.,1,1
65,Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Now I would like to turn to the current economic scene and this week's FOMC decision.,2,2
66,Higher inflation expectations would in turn lead workers to bargain for commensurate raises in nominal wages to preserve the real value of their earnings.,1,1
67,Some Reasons for the Decline in Far-Forward Rates Why have the far-forward rates implied by the term structure of interest rates declined in recent years?,2,2
68,"For example, for 2003 as a whole, growth in both the monetary base and M2 should be about equal to growth in nominal GDP.",0,2
69,"It is now generally recognized that price stability is a prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources in our economy and, indeed, for fulfilling our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment over time.",1,1
70,"The slowing economy, together with rising interest rates, was in turn a major factor in precipitating the stock market crash.",2,1
71,"From the end of 2000 to the end of 2003, productivity rose at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate and, even after recent downward revisions to the data, it is estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of 2-1/4 percent since the end of 2003.",2,2
72,"Petroleum prices have been under particular pressure, reflecting not only stronger demand but also risks that supplies could be constrained by terrorism or political disruption.",1,1
73,There appears to have been some evolution in inflation-targeting regimes toward greater flexibility.,0,0
74,Presumably even normal amortized equity that did not come from higher home prices was extracted in this manner.,2,2
75,The Decline in Long-Term Interest Rates and the Role of Monetary Policy One of the most remarkable and fundamental changes in the global financial landscape over the past three decades has been the steady and significant decline in global sovereign bond yields.,0,0
76,"With gross retail margins amounting to about 30 percent of sales, a reduction in currently elevated margins could make an important contribution to reduced inflation pressures in consumer goods.",1,1
77,"If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will.",2,2
78,"Thus, I believe this description essentially characterizes the current macroeconomic environment, and my own projection of inflation at a three-year horizon is equal to my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.",2,2
79,"The price of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or a linear yard of cotton broad-woven fabrics, could be reasonably compared over a period of years.",2,2
80,"More specifically, we observed financial-market developments over the period beginning fifteen minutes before and ending forty-five minutes after each policy decision became known to the public.4 The advantage of restricting the analysis to a short period spanning the Committee's decision is that the changes in yields or asset prices occurring within that narrow window are more likely to reflect the impact of the decision, as opposed to the arrival of other information about the economy.",2,2
81,"The release this year and last of mortgage price data gathered under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) has highlighted a different, but potentially related, concern about access to credit on equal terms.",2,2
82,"Progress at Home and Abroad Over the past several quarters, we have seen improvement in inflation and activity both at home and abroad following a period when the drag on domestic activity from abroad was considerable.",2,1
83,"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.8 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.",1,2
84,"Although personally I have no doubt that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of communication raised by such a change.",1,2
85,"For example, the Stock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the 1990-91 recession very weakly and rather late.",2,2
86,"The net effect could be steady, rising, or falling inflation--depending on whether productivity continues to accelerate and on how low the unemployment rate is driven in the process.",2,1
87,"The early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to be temporary fluctuations in inflation.15 Indeed, responding may do more harm than good, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effective lower bound even in good times.",0,0
88,"At these low rates, the central bank is poorly positioned to respond to further negative demand shocks.",1,0
89,"In this environment, America's prospects for economic growth will greatly depend on our capacity to develop and to apply new technology--a quest that inevitably will entail some risk-taking.",2,2

(via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting.1 I regret that we are not meeting in person, but I look forward, as always, to a conversation with my good friend and one-time colleague Tim Adams.",2,2
91,That central bank independence promotes lower inflation in developed countries is well-established by the economic literature.,2,2
92,We need to remember that in decades past it was believed that monetary policy was most effective when it was least transparent.,2,2
93,"In a nutshell, I believe that the factors of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, arising partly in response to episodes of high inflation, have effectively eroded the central bank monopoly on the provision of monetary services and have enhanced global competition among currencies.",2,2
94,"More recent data are not available, but I suspect that trend has continued since 1992 as the strong performance of the economy, coupled with generally ample availability of credit, has created an environment conducive to the birth and growth of innovative enterprises of all ownership types.",2,1

Clarida At the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association.1 I look forward to my conversation with Rob Nichols, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and some of the initiatives we have announced to support the flow of credit to households and firms during these challenging times.",2,2
96,"We said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",0,0
97,"Another difficulty in assessing the current amount of slack in the economy, and a third uncertainty, concerns the divergent patterns in alternative measures of excess demand.",2,2
98,U.S. inflation remains muted.,0,0
99,The ultimate responsibility for price stability rests with the Federal Reserve.,2,2
100,"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.",2,2
101,"However, making significant use of this option would bias credit flows in the direction of depository institutions and, if the volume of these loans were large enough, could affect the interest rates on the assets, specifically bank loans held by such institutions.",2,2
102,"On the other hand, the fact that productivity growth has remained solid in recent years increases confidence that a larger fraction of those productivity gains reflects longer-term developments and a smaller fraction reflects cyclical factors.",0,2
103,The effect of a productivity slowdown on employment growth is likewise ambiguous in the medium term.,2,2
104,"For these reasons, I have been interested in exploring approaches that expand the space for targeting interest rates in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our conventional policy space and in a way that reinforces forward guidance on the policy rate.18 In particular, there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on Treasury securities at the short-to-medium range of the maturity spectrumâ€”yield curve capsâ€”in tandem with forward guidance that conditions liftoff from the ELB on employment and inflation outcomes.",0,0
105,"After taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what unemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can be sustained in the longer run?",2,2
106,"Modern quantitative approaches to risk measurement and risk management take as their starting point historical experience with market price fluctuations, which is statistically summarized in probability distributions.",2,2
107,The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.,0,0
108,"Historically, recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation.",2,0
109,"In such an environment, a central bank mandated to pursue price stability can be flexible according to the circumstances, while one with a numerical target may need to obtain formal modification of its objectives.",2,2
110,"In April, prices of core goods and services--that is, consumer prices excluding food and energy--were unchanged for a second month.",2,0
111,The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits--fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices.,0,1
112,"Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly what is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, ""Term Premium Decomposition"").",2,2
113,"However, the available measures of expectations--whether from surveys or financial markets--have shown longer-term expectations increasing very little, if at all, throughout this period, providing some assurance about the inflation outlook.",2,2
114,"Now with respect to the first objective, the rationale for maximizing employment is fairly obvious.",0,0
115,This secular decline in term premiums since 1990 appears to be correlated with the decline in long-run inflation uncertainty and in short-term interest rate uncertainty.,0,2
116,"In December 1996, before my time at the Board, John Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale made a presentation at the Fed, in which they used dividend-price ratios and related measures to argue that the stock market was overvalued.",2,2

119,"That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources, while inflation remains subdued.",0,0
120,"In addition, the dramatic advances in biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine.",2,2
121,"The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers.",2,2
122,"Stock options are incorporated, based on gains upon exercising the options, in the productivity and cost measure, but not in the ECI.",2,2
123,"By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.",0,0
124,Some may see a monetary policy that actively addresses episodes of financial instability along the lines that I have just described as promoting excessive risk-taking and thus increasing the probability of future crises.,1,1
125,"Were we to introduce an interest rate rule, how would we judge the meaning of a rule that posits a rate far above or below the current rate?",2,2
126,"The literature on this topic extends at least as far back as William Brainardâ€™s original paper on uncertainty and policy almost forty years ago.7 Brainardâ€™s analysis showed that if policymakers are uncertain about how real activity and inflation will be affected over time by monetary actions, they should be less aggressive in responding to changes in economic conditions than would be the case if they knew the true model of the economy.",2,0
127,"Inflation in 1996, measured by the chain price index for GDP or the core CPI, was the lowest in 30 years.",0,0
128,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been responsible for monetary policy decisions in the United States since it was established by the Banking Act of 1935, two decades after the founding of the Fed itself.2 The movement toward committees reflects the advantages of committees in aggregating a wide range of information, perspectives, and models.",2,2
129,This is perhaps because the emphasis on price stability is taken by some as carrying a hint of restrictive policy and as an inclination to always be leaning against cyclical increases in demand.,2,1
130,"For example, although a number of features of Brazilian law promote the independence of the nation's central bank, the bank's de facto independence may be limited by the power of the president to remove members of the Monetary Policy Committee.",2,2
131,"Referring to monetary policy developments in the 1980s, Greenspan writes: In recognition of the lag in monetary policy's impact on economic activity, a preemptive response to the potential for building inflationary pressures was made an even more important feature of policy.",2,1
132,"In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.",0,0
133,"Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny.",2,2
134,"The second is intermediate-term need for reserve expansion and contraction, arising, for example, from seasonal changes in the demand for currency and reserves.",2,2
135,"For example, given the starting point for the outlook, the forecasts will trace out a path for the economy to preserve or reestablish maximum employment and price stability that will reflect FOMC participants' views of the relative variation in output and inflation that is possible in the short run.",2,2
136,"Fourth and finally, the statement codifies the key lesson from the Global Financial Crisisâ€”that financial stability is necessary for the achievement of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.",2,1
137,"In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year.",0,0
138,"At the time, we could only observe outcomes that did not fit with preconceptions; try to find rationales that explained what we were seeing; and in the process, derive implications about the future that could be used to guide a forward-looking monetary policy.",2,2

141,"This volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and we are addressing it.",2,2

143,"I strongly supported the FOMC's decision last week, and I expect to support additional rate increases until we see significant progress toward bringing inflation down.",1,1
144,"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.",2,2
145,"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.",0,0

148,"In contrast, Robert Lucas and others reached more dramatic conclusions, arguing that only unpredictable movements in monetary policy can affect the real economy and concluding that policy has no capacity to smooth the business cycle (Lucas, 1972; Sargent and Wallace, 1975).",2,2
149,"This is the scenario from which we draw the lesson that timely, typically preemptive, policy restraint to avoid the excesses of a boom results in longer expansions and avoids unnecessary fluctuations in both output and inflation.",1,1
150,"Central banks have adopted price stability as a key long-term objective, and they have become more transparent and systematic in their operations.",1,1
151,The benefits achieved through more-stable prices are substantial.,1,1
152,"To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts.",1,1
153,"With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium.",2,2
154,It would have been difficult for the Committee to put forward a 7 percent unemployment goal when the current program started and unemployment was 8.1 percent; this would have involved a lot of uncertainty about the magnitude of asset purchases required to reach this goal.,0,0
155,"Because they cannot rule out the chance that some asset prices might correct more than anticipated, policymakers must consider how the economy might withstand such a correction.",2,1
156,The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal tax increases and spending cuts will slow the pace of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth about 1-1/2 percentage points this year.3 Tight fiscal policy may also be preventing faster reductions in unemployment.,0,0
157,"First, tightening will in all likelihood occur in the context of a more firmly established economic recovery in the United States so that any adverse effects on EME financial conditions should be buffered by the beneficial effects of higher external demand.",1,1
158,The complementarity of price stability with the other goals of monetary policy is now the consensus view among economists and central bankers.,1,1
159,"To be sure, our main tool, monetary policy, is a blunt instrument that cannot be targeted at individual industries or regions.",2,2
